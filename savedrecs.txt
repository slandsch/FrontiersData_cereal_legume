J	"Agegnehu, G; Ghizaw, A; Sinebo, W"				"Agegnehu, Getachew; Ghizaw, Amare; Sinebo, Woldeyesus"			Yield performance and land-use efficiency of barley and faba bean mixed cropping in Ethiopian highlands	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"aggressivity; barley; crowding coefficient; faba bean; intercropping; land equivalent ratio; mixed cropping"	"GRAIN-YIELD; INTERCROPS; WHEAT; PEA; PRODUCTIVITY; COMPETITION; STABILITY; COWPEA; SYSTEM; MAIZE"	Mixed intercropping of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) with faba bean (Vicia faba L.) was compared with sole cropping for three growing seasons (2001-2003) at Holetta Agricultural Research Centre, in the central highlands of Ethiopia. The treatments were sole barley (125 kg ha(-1)), sole faba bean (200 kg ha(-1)) and an additive series of 12.5, 25, 37.5, 50 and 62.5% of the sole seed rate of faba bean mixed with full barley seed rate. A randomised complete block design replicated four times was used. Mixed cropping and year effects were significant for seed and biomass yields of each crop species. Barley yield was reduced by mixed cropping only when the seed rate of faba bean exceeded 50 kg ha(-1) or 25% of the sole seed rate. There was no mixed cropping by year interaction effect for barley grain yield but for faba bean seed yield. Total yield, barley yield equivalent, land equivalent ratio (LER) and system productivity index (SPI) of mixtures exceeded those of sole crops especially when faba bean seed rate in the mixture was increased to 75 kg ha(-1) (37.5%) or more. The highest barley yield equivalent, SPI, crowding coefficient and LER were obtained when faba bean was mixed at a rate of 37.5% with full seed rate of barley. From this study, it is inferred that mixed intercropping of faba bean in normal barley culture at a density not less than 37.5% of the sole faba bean density may give better overall yield and income than sole culture of each crop species.

J	"Tavoletti, S; Merletti, A"				"Tavoletti, Stefano; Merletti, Ariele"			A Comprehensive Approach to Evaluate Durum Wheat-Faba Bean Mixed Crop Performance	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						"durum wheat; Vicia faba minor; breeding for intercropping; principal component analysis; land equivalent ratio"	"GRAIN; PEA; INTERCROPS; EFFICIENCY; YIELD; BARLEY; PRODUCTIVITY; AGRICULTURE; COMPETITION; DIVERSITY"	Plant breeding for intercropping is lagging because most varieties currently available in the market are selected for sole cropping systems. The present study analyzed the response of durum wheat (12 varieties) and faba bean (3 varieties) in pure and mixed cropping. Field trials were conducted in 2019 and 2020. The performance of each variety in mixed and pure cropping was evaluated using both univariate and multivariate analyses of the grain yield and land equivalent ratio (LER). For durum wheat, grain protein content was also evaluated. Durum wheat varieties were characterized by good performance in both years, whereas faba bean varieties were more affected by the growing season, suggesting that much breeding effort is warranted to improve the latter as a pure and mixed crop. Moreover, the relative performance of all varieties was affected by their combination in mixed cropping, as evaluated based on the ratio (LERratio) between LER for wheat (LERw) and LER for faba bean (LERfb). To further evaluate the overall performance of wheat and faba bean in mixed cropping, total yield, LERtotal (LERw + LERfb), and ln(LERratio) were subjected to principal component and cluster analyses. The first principal component combined the total yield and LERtotal in a single index of the overall performance of each mixed crop combination. The second principal component, based on ln(LERratio), highlighted the relative performance of varieties in each mixed crop combination. The proposed multivariate approach can be applied in the breeding programs for intercropping to identify variety combinations based on crop performance and the relative importance of the proportion of cereal and legume grains in the total harvest.

J	Stelling, D				Stelling, D			Dry peas (Pisum sativum L.) grown in mixtures with faba beans (Vicia faba L.) - A rewarding cultivation alternative	JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ACKER UND PFLANZENBAU			English	Article						"dry pea; faba bean; genotype x environment interaction; suitability for combine harvesting; mixed cropping; lodging; yield stability"	DRIED PEAS	Two semi-leafless pea cultivars and two highly lodging-resistant faba bean cultivars were grown in a series of replacement trials conducted on a highly fertile loam soil near Gottingen from 1992 to 1995. Cultivation as well as harvesting of mixed crops of both species proved possible. In spite of the delayed harvest of the mixed crop stands determined by the later pod ripening of the faba beans (varying between seasons from +5 to +21 days), noticeable seed losses due to pod shattering were not observed for the overripe peas. Standing ability of the peas was considerably improved by mixed cropping. :Lodging began later and was less severe at harvest. Within mixtures with 50 % or more faba bean proportions at sowing (relative to the seeding rate of the pure stands) the peas, in most cases, remained nearly upright until harvest and instead of the usual 'Plattlager', i.e., prostrate but upright top, frequently a more highly inserted 'Hohllager', i.e., upright but collapsed at higher nodes, was observed. In contrast to these remarkably synergistic effects for standing ability, such effects proved to be only small and nonsignificant for grain yield (-1.5-2.9 %). Yield stability of the mixed crops was higher than that of the pure stands of both species. Estimates of the stability parameters, ecovalence, deviation from regression and environmental variance were at least halved. Yield proportions of peas and faba beans in the harvested seed of the mixtures did not correspond with the seed proportions at sowing. They differed considerably between seasons and cultivar combination. Higher yield proportions of faba beans were observed under wet and cold weather conditions and for the cultivar combination Victor/Diso, whereas higher yield proportions of peas were found under dry and warm weather conditions and for the cultivar combination Mythos/Baroness.

J	Paulsen, HM				Paulsen, Hans Marten			Organic mixed cropping systems with oilseeds 2. Yields of mixed cropping systems of linseed (Linum ustitatissivum L.) with spring wheat, oats or false flax	LANDBAUFORSCHUNG VOLKENRODE			German	Article						"Site productivity; mixed cropping; oilseeds; organic farming"	"CAMELINA; COMPETITION; MINERALS"	In trials on organic mixed cropping systems of linseed with spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), oats (Avena sativa L.) or false flax (Camelina sativa L.) linseed yields were always clearly reduced compared to linseed in sole cropping. In spring wheat linseed seed yields ranged between 0.01 and 0.37 t ha(-1). in mixed cropping with false flax linseed harvest was between 0.07 t ha(-1) and 1 t ha(-1) (dry matter). Linseed yields could be enhanced by reduction of seed densities of the second crop. A homogeneous seed distribution of both crops in connection with drill coulters offered the highest linseed yields in mixed cropping. Seed yields of spring wheat and false flax in mixed cropping with linseed increased disproportionately high compared to the chosen seed reduction in the mixed cropping systems. With the examined seed proportions in mixed cropping area productivity measured as land-equivalent ratio (LER) was increased up to 10 %. Compared to sole cropping of the crops mixed cropping with linseed can increase the raw income per hectare.

The treatments were sole teff (25 kg seed ha(-1)), sole faba bean (200 kg seed hall and 12.5, 25, 37.5, 50 and 62.5 % of the sole seed rate of faba bean mixed with a full teff seed rate. A randomized complete block design replicated four times was used. Treatment effects were significant for seed and biomass yields of cacti crop species. Increasing the seed rate of faba bean in teff/faba bean mixture increased faba bean seed yield but decreased teff grain yield. Nonetheless, mixed cropping of faba bean with teff increased land use efficiency and gave higher total yields compared to growing either species in Sole Culture. Teff yield equivalent, land equivalent ratios (LERs) and system productivity index (SPI) of the mixtures exceeded those of sole crops especially when the seed rate of faba bean in the mixture was increased to 50 kg ha(-1) (25 %) or more. The relatively high crowding coefficient values indicated yield advantages from mixed cropping of the two species. The highest values of teff yield equivalent, LFR and SPI were obtained when faba bean was mixed at a rate of 62.5 % with the full seed rate often. We Suggest that, at the Current prices of the respective crops, up to 62.5 % of faba bean can be mixed in normal teff to get better total yield and income than sole culture of either species.

The experiment was conducted during the 2004 and 2005 cropping seasons at Adet, Ethiopia. The treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design in a factorial combination with four replications. Treatment effects studied were disease severity, progress rate, area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) and grain yield. In some of the mixed cropping systems, disease severity showed a downward trend. FB:MA mixed cropping had a significant effect on disease severity, AUDPC and disease progress rate. The system reduced the epidemics of chocolate spot and increased FB grain yield. FB:FP increased the disease progress rate and reduced grain yield in both seasons. Short fungicide spray intervals (7 days) reduced the disease severity, AUDPC, and disease progress rate and increased the yield. Both local and the improved FB cultivar CS20DK showed almost similar disease progress rates. Mixed cropping with cereals contributed to the slowing of chocolate spot epidemics and increased grain yield of FB. It also promotes proactive integrated disease management. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Paulsen, HM				Paulsen, Hans Marten			Organic mixed cropping systems with oilseeds - 1. Yields of mixed cropping systems of legumes or spring wheat with false flax (Camelina sativa L. Crantz)	LANDBAUFORSCHUNG VOLKENRODE			German	Article						"site productivity; mixed cropping; oilseeds"	"WEED SUPPRESSION; REPLACEMENT; INTERCROPS; LINSEED; POPPY"	Organic mixed cropping systems of peas (Pisum sativum L.), lupins (Lupinus angustifolius L.) or spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) together with false flax were tested in field trials over three years at two sites. Mixed cropping with peas and false flax yielded between 0.07 and 3.58 t ha(-1) (dry matter) pea-seeds and from 0.32 to 1.75 t ha(-1) false flax. Mixed cropping of blue lupins with false flax led to seed yields from 0.09 to 2.31 t ha(-1) lupins and 0.42 to 2.35 t ha(-1) false flax. In mixed cropping systems, false flax could compensate for yield gaps of the legumes. Only in years with low yield level of the legumes, the total seed yield of the mixed cropping systems with false flax exceeded sole cropped legume yields. Mixed cropping of legumes with false flax increased the site productivity, measured as relative yield total (RYT). In mixed cropping of spring wheat with false flax, seed yields of false flax between 0.004 and 0.96 t ha(-1) and wheat yields between 1.32 and 4.79 t ha(-1) occurred. Yields of spring wheat in mixed cropping were normally lower than the corresponding yields of the sole cropping system. Overall yields of mixed cropping with false flax were lower or at the same level. Site productivities, measured as RYT, were not consistently elevated by the mixed cropping system. Yield shares of all mixed cultures with false flax could be determined by seed densities and row distances. Advantages in agricultural production (weed competition, lodging resistance), good eco-baiances and low production costs are good arguments for introducing site adopted mixed cropping systems with false flax. They would be more widespread if additional applications of false flax were explored besides the existing small market in human nutrition, e.g., as source of bio-energy or in animal feeding.

Little is known about the contribution of the root system to this overyielding potential and the related cultivar differences. This study investigated pure stands and mixtures of eight winter faba bean (Vicia faba L.) genotypes and one winter wheat cultivar (Triticum aestivum L., cv. Genius) with regard to their intra- and interspecific variation of shoot and root biomass and overyielding potential at full flowering of the bean.MethodsShoot biomass of 1m(2) was harvested and roots were sampled with a root auger down to 0.6m soil depth in two sampling years. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was successfully used to determine species specific root biomasses in mixtures. Statistics were performed using linear mixed effects models.ResultsMixtures of winter faba bean and winter wheat overyielded more below- than aboveground. Bean genotypes grown in mixtures with wheat differed significantly in their root biomass, root:shoot ratio and overyielding potential but not in their shoot biomass.ConclusionsGenotype differences in root biomass and overyielding indicate breeding potential of winter faba bean cultivars for mixed cropping.

The biological efficiency of intercropping cowpeas and rice was assessed by calculating the land equivalent ratio of dry matter yield, total N, and uptake of N. A reduced N uptake by both cowpeas and rice during mixed cropping was attributed to mutual competition, with both crops competing effectively for the scarce environmental resources. The lack of a significant difference in the uptake of fertilizer and soil N by mixed-crop rice and cowpeas is an indication that the soil N was sufficient and that the mixed cropping did not create any imbalance in soil and fertilizer N uptake. The land equivalent ratio ranged between 120% and 180% for shoot dry matter and total N, showing that biological efficiency was increased by intercropping cowpeas with rice. The proportion of N derived from the atmosphere by mono- and intercropped cowpeas was not significantly different, showing that the potential of cowpeas to fix N2 was independent of the cropping system, since the rice did not stimulate the cowpeas to fix more N2.

Since 2009, FiBL has established field trials in cooperation with organic farmers with a view to jointly developing suitable production methods under Swiss conditions. A range of seeding ratios as well as different combinations of species and cultivars have been tested. Standardised production methods developed to maturity are intercrops of protein peas with barley and field beans with oats, with both mixtures sown at 80 % and 40 % of the customary local monocrop seeding rates for the legumes and cereals respectively (and for both winter and spring crops). The cereal crop prevents the legumes from lodging, suppresses weeds, and offers risk protection should the grain legume not develop well. Average yields were 42 kg/100 m(2) for winter-sown pea-barley and 46.9 kg/100 m(2) for winter-sown field bean/oat intercrops. Only in isolated cases was the 30% legume content required to qualify for the 1000 CHF/ha 'subsidy for individual crops' not reached. The area under organic peas and organic field beans has multiplied since 2010, and these crops are mostly grown as part of a mixed crop. This is due not least of all to the mills that buy up and separate intercrop harvests.

Inter- and mixed-cropping of maize varieties with different genotypes is one way to effectively alleviate the high-temperature injury during the flowering period. However, the mitigation effect of different varieties and intercropping modes on high-temperature injury is still unclear. Based on previous years of field production, Denghai 605, which is more sensitive to high temperatures during the flowering period, was determined as the main test variety, and Zhengdan 958, Dedan 5, Weike 702, and Xianyu 335, which have great genotypic differences, were used as auxiliary varieties. The main test varieties and auxiliary varieties were intercropped and mixed cropped, respectively. Plant height, ear height, leaf area index, population light transmittance, ear characteristics, and yield were measured, and the land equivalent ratio (LER) was calculated. The plant height of Denghai 605 intercropped with Zhengdan 958 and Dedan 5 and mixed with Weike 702 and Xianyu 335 decreased significantly. The population light transmittance of the bottom or middle layer in Denghai 605 increased significantly when intercropped with other varieties. The grain number per ear increased significantly under inter- and mixed cropping with Zhengdan 958 and Weike 702. Except under intercropping with Dedan 5, the yield of Denghai 605 increased significantly, by 8.8-28.0%, under inter- and mixed cropping. Under intercropping with Zhengdan 958 and inter- and mixed cropping with Weike 702 and Xianyu 335, respectively, the group land equivalent ratio was greater than 1.1, indicating that under the combination of these varieties, inter- and mixed cropping effectively reduced the impact of high temperatures during flowering.

Maize (Zea mays) and sorghum (Sorghum sp.) are important crops for human and animal nutrition, as well as for bioenergy. The aim of this study was to investigate maize and sorghum in mixed cropping with soybean (Glycine max) and faba bean (Vicia faba) regarding biomass yield, drought tolerance, phosphorus (P) availability, and enzyme activity in soil as affected by the single and combined effects of water and P supply in two outdoor pot trials with rainout shelters. Maize had the highest biomass under sufficient water supply (80% water holding capacity, WHC), but a sharp decrease of its biomass of about 60% was measured when water was limited (30% WHC). In the mixtures, drought induced reduction of biomass was less than 40%. For mixed cropping usually higher contents of labile P fractions in soil than for sole cropped monocots were found. This was especially true for the combined stress of water and P deficit and can be partly explained by a higher activity of the acid phosphatase in the soil of the mixtures. A higher yield stability of the crop mixtures makes them a suitable agronomic alternative to sole cropped maize or sorghum under suboptimal conditions of water and P shortage.

"Lodging negatively affects wheat production worldwide. However, little is known about the potential of inter cropping (different genotypes of wheat are planted in alternating rows) and mixed cropping of different genotypes to enhance the lodging resistance of wheat populations. In this study, a field experiment was conducted with two cultivars, 'Shannong8355' (SN8355, a lodging-resistant cultivar) and 'Shannong15' (SN15, a lodging susceptible cultivar), to investigate the effect of these planting patterns on the occurrence of lodging in wheat and analyze the mechanism through which lodging resistance may be enhanced. Intercropping and mixed cropping of SN8355 with SN15 was shown to effectively reduce the occurrence of lodging in SN15, through SN8355 plants supporting SN15 plants and thereby inhibiting lodging of the composite population; the effect of mixed cropping was strongest. Furthermore, compared with the sole cropping and intercropping treatments, the mixed cropping of SN8355 and SN15 significantly improved the yield stability of wheat population. These results suggested that mixed cropping could inhibit the occurrence of lodging completely via lodging-resistant wheat cultivars providing both lateral and longitudinal support for lodging-susceptible cultivars, thus significantly enhancing the lodging resistance and yield stability of composite populations. The conclusion of this study could provide a theoretical basis to improve regulatory techniques for effectively inhibiting the occurrence of wheat lodging."

In the present study, five popular rice cultivars were selected and ten mixture combinations were made according to the growth period, plant height, grain yield and quality, and pest and disease resistance. Seedlings of the five cultivars and ten mixture combinations (mixed-sowing of the seeds in an equal ratio, then mixed-transplanting and finally mixed-harvesting) were grown in plastic pots in a glasshouse during the early and late growing seasons in 2016. RESULTSCompared with the mono-cropping systems in the early and late growing seasons in 2016 (paired t-test), the mixed-cropping systems increased the rice leaf photosynthetic rate, soil plant analysis development (SPAD) index and total aboveground dry weight. Moreover, mixed-cropping systems improved the number of spikelets per panicle, seed-setting rate, and grain weight per pot and harvest index by 19.52% and 5.77%, 8.53% and 4.41%, 8.31% and 4.61%, and 10.26% and 6.98% in the early and late growing seasons, respectively. In addition, mixed-cropping systems reduced chalky rice rate and chalkiness degree by 33.12% and 43.42% and by 30.11% and 48.13% in the early and late growing seasons, respectively. CONCLUSIONThe SPAD indexes and photosynthetic rates enhanced at physiology maturity in mixed-cropping systems may result in higher grain yield and better grain quality. In general, it was found that mixed-cropping with different rice cultivars has the potential for increasing grain yield and improving grain quality.

Current breeding programs do not select for enhanced general mixing ability (GMA) and neglect biological interactions within species mixtures. Clear concepts and efficient experimental designs, adapted to breeding for mixed cropping and encoded into appropriate statistical models, are lacking. Thus, a model framework for GMA and SMA (specific mixing ability) was established. Results of a simulation study showed that an incomplete factorial design combines advantages of two commonly used full factorials, and enables to estimate GMA, SMA, and their variances in a resource-efficient way. This model was extended to the Producer (Pr) and Associate (As) concept to exploit additional information based on fraction yields. It was shown that the Pr/As concept allows to characterize genotypes for their contribution to total mixture yield, and, when relating to plant traits, allows to describe biological interaction functions (BIF) in a mixed crop. Incomplete factorial designs show the potential to drastically improve genetic gain by testing an increased number of genotypes using the same amount of resources. The Pr/As concept can further be employed to maximize GMA in an informed and efficient way. The BIF of a trait can be used to optimize species ratios at harvest as well as to extend our understanding of competitive and facilitative interactions in a mixed plant community. This study provides an integrative methodological framework to promote breeding for mixed cropping.

The soil with a high nitrogen content (HSN) had been treated with animal waste materials and urea and cultivated with maize in the previous year, while the soil with a low N content (LSN) was not treated. Values of total nitrogen extractable with 2 mol L-1 KCl were 4.2 x 10(-4) kg kg-1 for the HSN condition and 1.3 x 10(-4) kg kg-1 for the LSN condition. Soybean and sorghum were planted as monocrops or in mixed cropping. The spacing was 18 cm x 18 cm for both cropping systems. Total dry weight was significantly larger under HSN than LSN conditions for both cropping systems. The dry weight in the soybean/sorghum mixed cropping system under HSN conditions was larger than that of the respective monocrops. However the total dry weight in the soybean/sorghum mixed cropping system under LSN conditions was smaller than that of the soybean monocrop. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) accounted for more than 90% of the N accumulated by soybean. The BNF of component soybean was higher than that of the monocrop. Furthermore, the BNF of soybean under LSN conditions was higher than that under HSN conditions, for both cropping systems. Soil N was the major source of N for both mono- and mixed cropped sorghum. Although the soybean BNF activity under LSN conditions was higher than that under HSN conditions, N transfer to component sorghum under LSN conditions was lower compared to that under HSN conditions. Nitrogen transferred accounted for about 7% of the total amount of N accumulated by component sorghum under HSN conditions. It is suggested that the N transfer may be due to the greater extent of root intermingling of component soybean and sorghum. Consequently, it is suggested that a certain amount of N is essential for a high dry matter production and N economy in the mixed cropping system.

Mixed-Cropping Between Field Pea Varieties Alters Root Bacterial and Fungal Communities	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							"PLANT DIVERSITY; RHIZOSPHERE MICROBIOME; SOIL; BIODIVERSITY; GENOTYPE; IMPACT; CARBON; MAIZE; KIN; INTENSIFICATION"	Modern agricultural practices have vastly increased crop production but negatively affected soil health. As such, there is a call to develop sustainable, ecologically-viable approaches to food production. Mixed-cropping of plant varieties can increase yields, although impacts on plant-associated microbial communities are unclear, despite their critical role in plant health and broader ecosystem function. We investigated how mixed-cropping between two field pea (Pisum sativum L.) varieties (Winfreda and Ambassador) influenced root-associated microbial communities and yield. The two varieties supported significantly different fungal and bacterial communities when grown as mono-crops. Mixed-cropping caused changes in microbial communities but with differences between varieties. Root bacterial communities of Winfreda remained stable in response to mixed-cropping, whereas those of Ambassador became more similar to Winfreda. Conversely, root fungal communities of Ambassador remained stable under mixed-cropping, and those of Winfreda shifted towards the composition of Ambassador. Microbial co-occurrence networks of both varieties were stronger and larger under mixed-cropping, which may improve stability and resilience in agricultural soils. Both varieties produced slightly higher yields under mixed-cropping, although overall Ambassador plants produced higher yields than Winfreda plants. Our results suggest that variety diversification may increase yield and promote microbial interactions.

Sustainable Mixed Cropping Systems for the Boreal-Nemoral Region	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Review						"catch crops; cover crops; double cropping; intercropping; nitrogen management; relay cropping"	"WINTER TURNIP RAPE; INTERCROPPING SPRING WHEAT; CATCH CROPS UNDERSOWN; ORGANIC ARABLE CROP; COVER CROPS; PEA-BARLEY; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; WEED SUPPRESSION; RESOURCE CAPTURE; NUTRITIVE-VALUE"	Mixed cropping, including intercropping, is the oldest form of systemized agricultural production and involves the growing of two or more species or cultivars of the same species simultaneously in the same field. However, mixed cropping has been little by little replaced by sole crop systems, especially in developed countries. Some of the advantages of mixed cropping are, for example, resource use efficiency and yield stability, but there are also several challenges, such as weed management and competition. The boreal-nemoral region lies within the region 55 to 70 degrees N. In this area, for example in Finland, the length of the thermal growing season varies from >105 to over 185 days. Typically, variation between locations and years is marked. However, during the year, there can be a wide range of temperature extremes between -70 and +30 degrees C. The majority of cropping systems in this region are usually monocultures, except for forage grass mixtures. The possibility of having several crops in a mixture is very challenging in the region due to the short growing season and extreme cold temperatures, meaning that crop earliness and overwintering capacity are a considerable restriction for year-round mixed cropping. A further restriction is the quality requirements set by the industry. Our review will explore a range of mixed cropping possibilities for the boreal-nemoral region, including different possible combinations of spring, winter, perennial, biennial, catch, and cover crops. The reviewed mixed cropping systems could considerably improve the sustainability and efficiency of crop production.	"[Lizarazo, Clara, I; Makela, Pirjo S.

In no-Mn berseem monoculture treatment, shoot dry weight (SDW) and root length (RL) were, respectively, 33% and 45% of the maximum recorded values obtained with berseem grown in mixed cropping with ryegrass at 60 days of growth. Corresponding values of SDW and RL of berseem when grown with raya were 78% and 76% of the maximum, respectively. Even though berseem grown in mixed cropping with ryegrass and raya had smaller RL/SDW ratio and greater shoot growth rate than berseem grown as monoculture, it acquired a high shoot Mn concentration because of 3.8 times more Mn influx. A high Mn influx was the result of a high concentration gradient that developed because of depletion of Mn at the root surface.

In a three-year field experiment, the sole crops maize (Ma) and sorghum (So), as well as mixtures of maize with scarlet runner bean (MaB) and sorghum with lupine (SoLu), were grown in a rainout shelter under optimal and suboptimal water availability with the aim of investigating their hydrological and agronomic characteristics. The targets of the present contribution are (1) analysing and quantifying the soil water balance of the different cropping treatments, (2) verifying that a well-proven hydrological model can be used to simulate hydrological processes under those specific experimental conditions (rainout shelter), and (3) examining whether mixed cropping is more efficient in using the growing factor water, evaluated by the water use efficiency (WUE), than sole cropping. The hydrological process analysis is based on measurements of groundwater table and irrigation. The observational data show that the evapotranspiration rate (ETR) of Ma was smaller than that of MaB. In contrast, the ETR of SoLu was similar to So. The experimental model reproduction with the SWAP model allowed a further investigation of the soil water balance by simulating spatially and temporally subtle hydrological process patterns. A bi-objective parameter optimization was used to improve the model performance by calibrating soil hydraulic model parameters against (1) soil water potential observed in the rainout shelter experiment, and (2) measured soil water retention curves at the study site. The attained Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies for the predicted soil water potential range from 0.43 to 0.77. These measures prove that the usage of a hydrological model in the specific environment of a rainout shelter is possible. The simulation results showed that capillary rise is important at the study site, serving partially as compensator of drought stress. The WUE estimated by simulated ETR and measured yield differed among the crops, but was independent of the water availability. In individual cases, the WUE in mixed cropping was higher than in sole cropping. A general more efficient usage of the growing factor water by means of mixed cropping could not be stated from the results.

However, it is unclear how commercial, high-yielding varieties adapt to less environmental conditions such as weed pressure and mixed cropping cultivation systems. In Europe, organic breeding organizations conserve local, traditional varieties and develop new varieties under low-input conditions, aiming at increasing the range of varieties adapted to harsh cultivation conditions and mixed cropping. To evaluate whether organic varieties (i) cope better with weed pressure and (ii) have a higher adaptability to mixed cropping, we compared the agronomic and quality performance of eight organic varieties with eight commercial, high-yielding varieties, focusing on tomato, the economically most important vegetable in the EU. Each group was cultivated as single plants and in a mixed cropping system, respectively, with a legume and with or without exposure to weed stress by a grass. The organic group outperformed the commercial, high-yielding group, specifically, in mixed cropping systems. Weed stress lowered the yield of both groups, but the organic group showed higher fruit weight stability across the varieties than the commercial, high-yielding varieties when grown as single plants under weed stress.

The experiment was performed on experimental field in Krakow (50 degrees 07' N 20 degrees 05' E). The greatest fat content was found in linseed seeds from mixed cropping with pea (391 kg). Significantly higher calorific value (56.3 GJ) was obtained in seeds of the linseed pure stand. In seeds of linseed predominated unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, MUFA). A slight increase in PUFA and MUFA content was observed in mixed cropping. The content of alpha-linolenic acid (C18: 3n-3) in linseed seeds was significantly influenced by the sowing method and the weather. Linseed in mixed cropping with vetch contained significantly more linoleic acid (18: 2n-6) and alpha-linolenic acid (18: 3n-3) than in pure stand. There was considerably more linoleic acid (C18: 2n-6) in mixed cropping with vetch, but in mixed cropping with pea there was much less of that acid.

Because nature consistently integrates her plants and animals into a diverse landscape, a major tenet of sustainable agriculture is to create and maintain diversity. The effects of earthworm inoculation (Pheretima sp., Ew), arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomus mosseae, AMF) and mixed cropping systems on forage yield, mycorrhizal colonization rate, nitrogenase activity (NA) of free-living rhizosphere bacteria, soil microbial biomass (SMB) carbon, and the growth of clovers were studied at various mixed cropping ratios of berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L., B) to Persian clover (Trifolium resupinatum L., P) (B:P = 1:0, 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3). The effects of AMF and Ew on plant yield were positive. Mixed cropping gave more stable yields than monoculture. The greatest mycorrhizal colonization rate was observed at a B:P ratio of 1:1 with a combined AM+Ew inoculant. With the AMF+Ew inoculant, the greatest NA of free-living rhizosphere bacteria was observed with B: P = 3: 1. Although Ew had no significant effect on SMB, AMF increased SMB from 256 to 444 mg carbon kg(-1). The greatest SMB (379 mg kg-1) was observed at B: P = 1: 1. The greatest nitrogen accumulation in the aboveground biomass, 31.5 mg g(-1) forage dry matter, was obtained with mixed cropping (B:P = 3:1) in the presence of the AMF+Ew inoculant. A combination of AMF, Ew, and mixed cropping increased the yield, mycorrhizal colonization rate, SMB, and nitrogen uptake of the clover plants, confirming the positive effects of diversity on an agriecosystem.

Thus, for the production of high-quality forage, cereal-legume mixed cropping is an efficient method for meat and milk production in the livestock sector. In a two-year experiment between 2020 and 2021, the forage yield, nutritional compositions, amino acid profile, and forage quality were evaluated in the mixed cropping of winter wheat and ryegrass with alfalfa. In this study, a split-plot design with a randomized block design was employed with three sampling replicates. Cultivars were harvested at three maturity stages, namely, flowering, milk, and soft dough, depending on the wheat growth stage. The experimental results show that wheat 2 (Baomai 9)-alfalfa and ryegrass-alfalfa mixed cropping produced higher fresh biomass output than mono-cropping of wheat and ryegrass harvested at the flowering stage. Furthermore, the dry matter (DM) percentage range increased from 20.18% to 36.39%. By contrast, crude protein, crude fiber, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber were higher at the flowering stage than at other harvesting stages with DM values of 14.28%, 34.12%, 55.06%, and 32.55%, respectively. Ryegrass-alfalfa mixing yielded higher values of mineral compositions, and T5 (Baomai 9-alfalfa) generally achieved more extraordinary amino acid compositions. The results demonstrate that wheat and ryegrass with alfalfa mixed cropping, and harvesting at the flowering period produces high-quality forage. Additionally, mixed cropping with alfalfa remarkably affected forage quality parameters, while mixed cropping of wheat cultivar 2 (Baomai 9) and alfalfa obtained the highest dry matter intake, digestible dry matter, relative feed value, total digestible nutrient, relative forage quality, and quality index values of 2.56, 68.54, 136.49, 60.50, 127.41, and 1.69, respectively. Thus, the mixed-cropping of wheat and ryegrass with alfalfa forage is recommended for its maximized quality forage production and nutritional values in livestock feedstuff.

We investigated the alleviative effects of mixed cropping using ice plant, which is one of the saltaccumulating halophytes, on the damage and growth inhibition of cowpea, which is not tolerant to high salinity. Three cropping patterns (mono cropping of cowpea and ice plant and their combination) were tested. The plants were treated with 0, 100, 200 and 300 mM NaCl for 14 days (consecutive NaCl). The plants were also treated with NaCl for 3 days, followed by 2 weeks (shortterm recovery) and 1 month (long-term recovery) recovery. Salinity levels for short-term recovery were similar to those of the consecutive experiment, while the concentration of long-term recovery was 250 mM. The alleviative effects of mixed cropping in the consecutive NaCl experiment were observed at 200 and 300 mM NaCl. Mixed cropping significantly reduced the Na content in the cowpea leaves at 200 and 300 mM NaCl compared with mono cropping. In addition, the Na content in the soil of mix-cropped cowpea at 200 and 300 mM NaCl was statistically lower than that of the mono cropping. Mixed cropping was effective to recover from high concentration of NaCl in the experiments of short-and long-term recovery. These results indicate that mixed cropping with a halophyte could be effective in mitigating the damage and growth inhibition of a glycophyte not only under salinity but also under recovery periods.

Forage and maize yields in mixed crop-livestock farming systems Enhancing forage and maize yields in mixed crop-livestock systems under conservation agriculture in sub-humid Zimbabwe	NJAS-WAGENINGEN JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article						"Cropping systems; Gross margins; Intercropping; Rotations; Sole maize"	"SOIL FERTILITY MANAGEMENT; VIGNA-UNGUICULATA L.; ZEA-MAYS L.; PLANTING DATE; INTENSIFICATION; PRODUCTIVITY; BENEFITS; GROWTH; REGION; MANURE"	In mixed crop-livestock farming systems, smallholder farmers face the challenge of insufficient dry season livestock feed whilst crop production is mainly constrained by poor soil fertility and erratic rains. Conservation agriculture (CA) which is premised on three main principles namely minimal soil disturbance, crop rotations and mulching is being promoted as a potential solution to declining soil productivity. However, farmers implementing CA in mixed crop-livestock systems are conflicted by the use of crop residues either as livestock feed or as mulch under crop production. A study was carried from 2012/13 to 2014/15 season in Murehwa, a subhumid region of Zimbabwe, to evaluate the effects of maize-legume cropping systems on forage, maize grain yield and gross margins. In this context, forage refers to the plant material/biomass harvested for livestock feeding. The cropping systems involved one conventional tillage practice with continuous sole maize (CT), four CA treatments consisting of continuous sole maize, maize-mucuna intercrop, maize-cowpea intercrop and maize-groundnut/soybean rotations. The experiment was replicated on eight farmers' fields with each farmer treated as a replicate. Maize-mucuna (4 134 kg ha(-1)) and maize-cowpea (3 999 kg ha(-1)) intercrop systems significantly increased forage yield compared to CA sole maize (3 646 kg ha(-1)) and CT sole maize (3 076 kg ha(-1)). Among the rotations, maize-soybean rotation system performed better than the maize-groundnut system with respect to forage yield and maize grain. Intercropping and sole cropping systems however showed no significant maize grain yield difference. The highest and lowest gross margins/ha were obtained from the maize-mucuna intercrop (US$1395) and maize-soybean rotation system (US$507), respectively. The study thus suggests that farmers can grow legumes as intercrops with maize without any loss in maize grain yield. Maize-mucuna intercropping was the best of the tested cropping systems with respect to forage yield and gross margins in mixed crop-livestock systems of Murehwa.	"[Mutsamba, E.

Bragg and its supernodulating mutant nts1007, were grown under mono- or mixed-cropping with sorghum (Sorghum vulgare cv. FS 103) at 20 or 90 kg N ha(-1). Differences in dry matter production, N-2 fixation and N transfer to the companion crop sorghum were examined using the N-15-dilution method. The total dry weights of the Bragg-sorghum mixtures per concrete frame were not significantly different from Bragg monocrops. The dry weight of the nts1007-sorghum mixture at 20 kg N ha(-1) was greater, but that of the mixture at 90 kg N ha(-)1 was smaller than nts1007 monocrop. The dry weights of Bragg or nts1007 mixtures were consistently greater than that of sorghum monocrops. Mixed-cropping sorghum with Bragg or nts1007 was more efficient than the monocrops in dry matter production, as indicated by the land equivalent ratios (LER). The LER value for Bragg-sorghum mixed-cropping was greater than nts1007-sorghum. While the dry weight of Bragg increased by mixed-cropping at both rates, that of nts1007 increased only at 20 kg N ha(-1). The dry weight of sorghum component was consistently greater than the monocrop, and was mote pronounced when grown in association with Bragg. The amount of N-2 fixed by Bragg was greater than that by nts1007, however no significant difference between the proportion of total N derived from fixed N-2 was observed. N-2 fixation was greater under 90kg N ha(-1) and mixed-cropping than under 20 kg N ha(-1) or monocropping, except for nts1007 at 90 kg N ha(-1). The nodule dry weight of nts1007 was consistently greater than Bragg. Total N accumulated by the sorghum component was greater than that of the monocrop and was also greater in association with Bragg than with nts1007. N transfer accounted for 20 and 55% of the N accumulated by the sorghum component with Bragg at 20 and 90 kg N ha(-1), respectively. N transfer to the sorghum component in association with nts1007 accounted for 11 and 35% of the N accumulated at 20 and 90 kg N ha(-1), respectively. The consistent dilution of N-15 in the tissues of the sorghum component compared to the monocrops suggests that N transfer rather than ''sparing'' of fertilizer N accounted for the improved N nutrition. It seems that the more the roots of the companion crops were intermingled, the greater the amount of N transfer.

This system is intensive with high-input forage crops. In the United States (US) Southern Great Plains, the system is based primarily on high-input annual grass-type crops in monocropping approaches and requires diverse low-input broadleaf crops for strengthening its sustainability. Winter canola (Brassica napus L.) and pea (Pisum sativum L.) have the potential to provide forage crop diversity options with high forage yields of high quality. Winter canola and pea in mono- and mixed-cropping approaches at seeding ratios of canola/pea at 0:100, 25:75, 50:50, 75:25, and 100:0 were studied for yield and quality in 2015 and 2016 in Clovis, New Mexico (NM). Averaged over years, canola-pea at 75:25 and 50:50 seeding ratios produced similar biomass forage yield but higher than mono-pea by 43% and canola-pea at 25:75 and mono-canola cropping by 8%. The land equivalent ratio of all mixed-cropping treatments exceeded 1.0, with canola-pea at the 50:50 seeding ratio recording a land equivalent ratio of 1.15, indicating that mixed-cropping systems are better users of land resources. Total digestible nutrients and relative feed value were higher in canola-pea mixed cropping than in mono-canola and mono-pea cropping. Canola-pea mixed cropping achieved high yields (13.3 to 14.7 Mg.ha(-1)) with improved forage quality, as well as improved crop and land productivity, with the potential to improve mechanical harvestability of vining pea, and strengthen the diversity and sustainability of forage crop-dairy farming in the Southern Great Plains under limited irrigation input of similar to 300 mm.

We focused on N and P absorption of oat in mixed cropping with hairy vetch, and investigated the effect of the mixed-cropping green manure on the growth and nutrient uptake of the succeeding corn. The total N and total P contents of oat mixed-cropped with hairy vetch were higher than those of sole-cropped oat, and dry weight in addition to N and P contents of oat were greatly increased by cutting mixed-cropped hairy vetch before blooming. Sole cropping of hairy vetch was the best green manure to enhance the growth and nutrient uptake of the succeeding corn crop, but mixed cropping of oat with hairy vetch was also highly effective. Further investigations are needed to determine the long-term effect of mixed cropping green manure on N and P sequestration as soil organic matter.

Weed suppression in mixed cropped grain peas and false flax (Camelina sativa)	WEED RESEARCH			English	Article						"mixed cropping; Pisum sativum; Camelina sativa; weed suppression; organic farming; resource competition"	"INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; YIELD; INTERFERENCE; PERFORMANCE; STANDS; BEANS"	Mixed cropping peas with false flax, a brassica oil seed crop, in additive arrangements had a significant suppressive effect on weed coverage (63% in 2003 and 52% in 2004), compared with the monocropped pea plots. Weed suppression by false flax was apparently restricted to the establishment phase, because effects were significant against the key annuals Fallopia convolvulus, Sonchus oleraceus and Matricaria recutita, but ineffective towards the major perennials Cirsium arvense and Elytrigia repens. Relatively higher yields in mixed stands with calculated land equivalent ratios (LER) of 1.43 (2003) and 1.98 (2004) were the result of low monocrop yields mainly related to weed pressure not only in pea but also in false flax. Partial LERs were in favour of peas, demonstrating a balanced but asymmetric complementarity of the components, with peas as the main and false flax as the minor crop component. The role of false flax in row-cropped peas can be characterized as both a smother crop and weed antagonist with no obvious indications for allelopathic traits. Weed suppression was probably achieved by a mutually enhanced competitiveness of both crop components, indicating a mechanism based on resource allocation, but further research is needed for a better understanding of weed-suppressive traits in pea-false flax mixed cropping systems.

Analysis of variance showed a significant effect of planting date and cropping pattern as well as a combined effect of planting date x cropping pattern. Delayed planting (30 November) resulted in a very high level of aflatoxin contamination. The level of aflatoxin was low when mustard was cultivated along with wheat (mixed cropping). Varuna was more susceptible to aflatoxin than BR-40. The maximum number of fungi was recorded in mixed cropping samples.

The results indicate that monocultures tended to have similar density of aphids, Aphid glycines Matsumura, but a higher density of leafhoppers, Empoasca flavescens (Fab.), than mixed cropping systems. The mixed cropping array significantly increased the population density of some generalist natural enemies, including ladybeetles, lacewings and hoverflies, to varying degrees. These findings suggest that mixed cropping systems may be more effective to control insect pests than monocultures in soybean fields, and these findings offer a practical implication in modern soybean agricultural industry.

Forage and seed yield of winter turnip rape established as a mixed crop with cereals	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article							"BRASSICA-NAPUS L.; OILSEED RAPE; DUAL-PURPOSE; INTERCROP PRODUCTIVITY; PLANT-POPULATIONS; ANIMAL NUTRITION; RESOURCE CAPTURE; GRASS MATURITY; NITROGEN; GROWTH"	Cultivation of winter turnip rape (Brassica rapa L. ssp. oleifera (DC.) Metzg.) in Finland has been limited because of its reputation as an unreliable crop and its mid-season sowing time of July, when fields are already sown to other crops. An alternative management practice for winter turnip rape is proposed whereby it would be sown as a mixed crop simultaneously with spring cereals. The growth and yield formation of winter turnip rape grown in mixed stands with four different spring cereals was studied in two field experiments conducted in 2009-11. Pure and mixed stands of winter turnip rape and spring cereals were established in May at two different cereal and winter turnip rape stand densities. Subsequent to cereal harvest, one-third of each winter turnip rape plot was harvested for biomass in autumn, before cessation of growth. Three plant stand types, May- and July-sown monocrops and a mixed crop with oat (Avena sativa L.) were sampled for forage analysis. Plant stand densities were monitored from establishment until maturity. Winter turnip rape yield and its quality, including oil content, protein content and thousand seed weight, were determined. Following favourable overwintering conditions, winter turnip rape established with cereals yielded comparably to that of pure stands in terms of both quantity and quality. However, a pure stand of winter turnip rape out-yielded mixed crop stands after unfavourable overwintering conditions. Leaf removal decreased plant survival and seed yield. Establishing winter turnip rape with a cereal in May is an alternative to sowing it as a monocrop in July. A higher seeding rate is needed for under-sown winter turnip rape. Furthermore, autumn-harvested winter turnip rape monocrop forage potentially represents a high-protein supplement for ruminants.	"[Tuulos, A.; Jaakkola, S.; Makela, P. S.

Five varieties of Gladiolus viz. Pricella, Fado, Blues, Victor Brogy and Chinon were sown in 3 x 5 m(2) field plots with inter plant distance of 7 cm. Narcissus bulbs were sown in between the two Gladiolus corms. For comparison, bulbs of Gladiolus varieties and N. papyraceus were also sown in monocultures with inter plant distance of 7 cm. In general, mixed cropping with Narcissus increased root length and corm weights in Gladiolus varieties while exhibited no pronounced effect on days to sprouting and spike emergence, shoot and spike length, number of flowers and corm size. Except for reduction in root length of Narcissus due to mixed cropping with Victor Brogy, the effect of mixed cropping with different varieties of Gladiolus had no effect on various vegetative and reproductive growth parameters of Narcissus. In general, mycorrhizal colonization was significantly higher in mixed cropped Gladiolus as well as Narcissus plants than corresponding mono cultivated plants. The effect of mixed cropping on mycorrhizal colonization was more pronounced in Narcissus than in Gladiolus. The mixed cropping of Gladiolus and Narcissus increase mycorrhizal colonization in both the cut-flowers.

In order to evaluate to what extent mixed cropping with legumes benefits plant P nutrition in dependence of P availability, experiments are required with a wide range of P supply. The objective of this study was to assess the P nutrition of sole cropped cereals and cereal-legume mixtures as affected by inorganic and organic P fertilizers in single and combined applications. Maize (Zea mays) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) in sole cropping and combined with runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus) and lupine (Lupinus angustifolius, Lupinus mutabilis) were cultivated in three consecutive years from 2013 to 2015 on plots of a long-term field experiment established in 1998 with nine P fertilizer treatments. Crop biomass yields and nutrient uptakes were analyzed as well as chemical and biological soil properties. On average over the three experimental years and all fertilizer treatments the highest yields were measured for maize in sole cropping (14.9 Mg ha(-1)) followed by maize + bean (13.8 Mg ha(-1)), sorghum (10.9 Mg ha(-1)), and sorghum + lupine (9.75 Mg ha(-1))(p < 0.001). Advantages of mixed cropping were preferentially found under P deficiency in the treatment without P supply. Here the yields and P uptakes of the mixtures were comparable or even higher than maize or sorghum cultivated alone. The contribution of legume biomass to the total biomass of the mixtures was generally less than 10 %. Lowest activities of enzymes in the soil were found for maize. When maize was combined with bean the activities of acid phosphatase as well as the microbial activity in soil (measured as activity of dehydrogenase) increased, which may result in an increased P utilization of organic P compounds in soil. The results of this study showed, that the performance of cereal-legumes mixtures can be independent of external P supply and that they are an asset mainly under suboptimal conditions of P shortage.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of three plant patterns combined with three plant population densities (67,500, 82,500, and 97,500 plants.ha(-1)) on canopy architecture and grain yield. Zhengdan 958 (ZD958) and Denghai 605 (DH605) were used as experimental materials. Three different planting patterns were: mixture (M), random sowing after mixing seeds of the two hybrids in the same proportion; 1:1, one row of ZD958 and one row of DH605; and two monoculture systems, SZD958 and SDH605, as controls. A 3-yr study demonstrated that the mixed cropping treatments (M and 1:1) at low density (LD) showed no significant difference on light transmission, leaf area index (LAI), canopy apparent photosynthesis (CAP), and canopy respiration (CR), compared with the two monocultures. However, at a medium and high density (MD and HD), mixed cropping was characterized with higher light transmission to the ear and lower layers of the canopy during grain filling than that of monoculture treatments, while no significant differences between M and 1:1 treatments. Moreover, mixed cropping treatments maintained a higher LAI, CAP, lower CR, and increased the whole and post-silking dry matter accumulation. Grain yields were higher under mixed cropping at MD and high density (HD), while no significant differences between M and 1:1 treatments. Relative to SZD958 and SDH605, the grain yields in the M treatment were 10% and 8% higher at MD, and 7% and 5% higher at HD, respectively. Mixed cropping optimized the canopy structure, maintained higher LAI and CAP during the grain filling period, reduced respiration, and increased aboveground dry matter at maturity. These improvements also result in higher grain yield."

This led to the present study, in which we assessed the performance of wheat and chickpea, grown as sole crops or mixed at half their sole crop populations for their capacity to capture and use solar radiation and soil-water. Trials were conducted in the drought season of 1994 and with or without supplementary irrigation in an average rainfall season of 1995. For the rainfed crops in both years, there was no advantage of mixed crops over wheat grown as a sole crop (wheat-s) either in terms of green area index (GAI), fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the canopy (tPAR), dry matter (DM) or grain yield produced. The lack of a yield advantage of mixed cropping was associated with poor canopy development and low yielding capacity of chickpea; it was unable to compensate for its reduced population density in the mixture. Grain yield for chickpea in the mixed crop (chickpea-m) averaged just 29% that of its sole crop (chickpea-s), whereas wheat grown in mixture (wheat-m) produced 72% the yield for wheat-s: Supplementary irrigation from early spring onwards in 1995 increased yield for chickpea-m by 44% over that of chickpea-s, while yield for wheat-m fell to 65% that for wheat-s. Every millimetre of irrigation water increased yield by 10.0, 3.8 and 12.5 kg ha(-1) for wheat-s, mixed crop and chickpea-s, respectively. Mixed cropping did not affect the time taken by either wheat or chickpea to attain maximum growth rate, flowering or maturity. The land equivalent ratio (LER) based on grain yields for wheat-chickpea intercropping were 1.01 in 1994. 1.02 without irrigation in 1995, and 1.10 with irrigation in 1995. Neither radiation-use-efficiency nor water-use-efficiency was improved by mixed cropping compared with wheat-s. The poor performance of the mixed crop was ascribed to its poor canopy development early in the season, especially by the chickpea that resulted in low iPAR and transpiration. It is concluded that there was no advantage of growing wheat and chickpea in mixed crops in southern cereal belts of Australia if total biomass or grain yield is the primary purpose.

Experiment was laid out in factorial randomized complete block design with four seed rate combinations in different ratios of sorghum and guar along with six nutrient management treatments in three replications. Results showed that the root traits, viz. root length, volume and dry weight were higher under mixed cropping in comparison to sole crops however the difference was not significant, whereas the significant difference were observed in root traits under different nutrient management practices. Statistically higher green fodder yield was reported under sole sorghum but it was at par with 75% sorghum + 25% guar. Nutritionally enriched fodder with higher macro and micronutrients was also obtained under 75% sorghum + 25% guar treatment. Under mixed cropping nutrient uptake and soil nutrient status at crop harvest were higher in comparison to sole crops. Results pertaining to nutrient management practices revealed that higher supply of nutrients under 100% RDF, 100% RDF+PGPR, 100% RDF+seaweed extract and 75% RDF+seaweed extract treatments helped the crops to take up more nutrients besides leaving substantial balance in the soil at harvest. It was concluded that 75% sorghum + 25% guar mixed cropping with 75% RDF + seaweed extract was best combination to get higher and nutritionally enriched fodder and enriched soil at harvest.

Total nitrogen decreased in all the plots after cropping and available phosphorus reduced from initial value of 4.72 mg/kg to between 3.37 mg/kg where no fertilizer was added and 3.83 mg/kg under inorganic fertilizer. Exchangeable potassium decreased in all the plots irrespective of fertilizer type and the changes ranged between 25% under organic fertilizer and 53% under inorganic fertilizer treatment. The level of organic carbon decreased by about 17% under organic fertilizer but by 59% where inorganic fertilizer was applied. Calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) increased by 21% and 20%, respectively with the application of organic fertilizer. Though yields of crops increased with application of inorganic fertilizer, organic fertilizer and combination of both in this experiment, changes in soil nutrients status after cropping showed that the fertilizer rates used might not be able to sustain soil fertility under the system.

Mineral nutrition of wheat, chickpea and lentil as affected by mixed cropping and soil moisture	NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						"acid phosphatases; mixed cropping; mineral nutrition; fe(III)-complexing compounds; seed mineral content"	"MAYS L. GENOTYPES; ACID-PHOSPHATASE; PHOSPHORUS-NUTRITION; WHITE LUPIN; ROOT-GROWTH; INTERCROPPED MAIZE; IRON-DEFICIENCY; HUMAN-NEEDS; ZINC; EFFICIENCY"	Interspecific complementary and competitive interactions on yield and N, P, K, Fe, Zn and Mn nutrition of mixed wheat/chickpea and wheat/lentil grown in a glasshouse under normal and drought conditions, and intercropping of wheat/chickpea in the field under rainfed conditions were investigated. The results of the experiments confirmed that drought significantly decreased the growth and mineral nutrition of all plant species. Individual plant dry weights of wheat, chickpea and lentil in the glasshouse experiment, and vegetative shoot dry weight of intercropped wheat in the field experiment were significantly increased by the associated plant species as compared with their monoculture. Even though there were increases in vegetative shoot dry weight of wheat, biological and seed yield of intercropped wheat and chickpea were decreased due to the lower row number in intercropping. However, the calculated LER (Land Equivalent Ratio) was found to be higher than 1.0 for biological and seed yields, showing that intercropping of wheat and chickpea has an advantage over monoculture. In many cases, the drought x cropping system interaction on the nutrient concentrations of plant species was not significant. Results of the glasshouse study showed that P nutrition of wheat was improved by chickpea and lentil, which might result from increases in leaf acid phosphatase in mixed cropping. The release of Fe(III)-complexing compounds from the roots was higher in the sole wheat and mixed culture than that of monocultured chickpea and lentil. This improves Fe nutrition of wheat and chickpea, but those improvements were not significant. However, Zn and Mn concentrations of mixed cropped chickpea were also increased. Under the field conditions, shoot concentration of P, K, Fe, Zn and Mn in wheat were increased by intercropping. Furthermore, the concentrations of Zn and Mn in chickpea were increased by intercropping while N, P and K concentrations were decreased. In addition, the concentrations of N, P, K and Fe for wheat seeds and of Zn and Mn for chickpea were improved by intercropping. It is concluded that interspecific interaction was complementary and generally facilitated the mineral nutrition of wheat and chickpea species grown in mixed culture. Besides giving a yield advantage, intercropping of chickpea and wheat also had a positive effect on seed mineral composition.

Faba bean was yielding more in the maize/faba bean intercropping, but not in the wheat/faba bean intercropping. Biomass, grain yield and N acquisition of faba bean were significantly increased when intercropped with maize, and decreased significantly with wheat, irrespective of N-fertilizer application, indicating that the legume could gain or lose productivity in an intercropping situation. There was yield advantage of maize/faba bean intercropping, but no in wheat/faba bean intercropping. The grain yield of the faba bean intercropped with maize was greater than that of faba bean monoculture due to increases of the stems per plant and the pods per stem of faba bean. N fertilization inhibited N fixation of faba bean in maize/faba bean and wheat/faba bean intercropping and faba bean monoculture. The responses of different cropping systems to N-fertilizer application, however, were not identical, with competitive intercropping (wheat/faba bean) being more sensitive than facilitative intercropping (maize/faba bean). Intercropping increased the percentage of N derived from air (%Ndfa) of the wheat/faba bean system, but not that of the maize/faba bean system when no N fertilizer was applied. When receiving 120 kg N/ha, however, intercropping did not significantly increase %Ndfa either in the wheat/faba bean system or in the maize/faba bean system in comparison with faba bean in monoculture. The amount of shoot N derived from air (Ndfa), however, increased significantly when intercropped with maize, irrespective of N-fertilizer application. Ndfa decreased when intercropped with wheat, albeit not significantly at 120 kg N/ha. Ndfa was correlated more closely with dry matter yield, grain yield and competitive ratio, than with %Ndfa. This indicates that that total dry matter yield (sink strength), not %Ndfa, was more critical for the legume to increase Ndfa. The results suggested that N fixation could be improved by yield maximization in an intercropping system.

Maize grain yields were significantly reduced in the mixed cropping system. This yield difference became smaller with the application of N and P fertilizer. The N and P concentrations in maize ear leaves at silking indicated that a dificiency in N and P contributed to the maize yield depression in mixed cropping. Competition for soil and fertilizer N between maize and cowpeas was suggested by: (1) A similarity in total N uptake between the two cropping systems; (2) efficient use of soil nitrate by the cowpeas; and (3) low N2 fixation by the cowpeas, calculated with the aid of an extended-difference method. In general, N2 fixation was low, with the highest values in the sole cropping (53 kg ha-01) and a substantial reduction in the mixed cropping system. The application of N fertilizer further reduced N2 fixation. This was substantiated by nodule counts. The lower N2 fixation in the mixed cropping system was only partly explained by the lower density of cowpeas in this system. In addition, dry spells during the cropping season and shading by the maize component could have reduced the nodulation efficiency. No N transfer from the legume/rhizobium to the non-legume crop was observed. Impaired P nutrition in the mixed compared with the sole-cropped maize might have been due to less P mobility in the soil. This was indicated by lower soil moisture contents in the topsoil under mixed cropping, especially during the dry year of 1986. The results show that mixed cropping of maize and cowpeas did not lead to improved use of soil and fertilizer N and P or to an enhanced N2 fixation. On the contrary, an annual rotation of maize and cowpeas was clearly superior."

The objective of the present study was to assess the effects of introduction of a rice-based mixed cropping system to the seasonal wetlands (ondombe in the local language) from agronomic, social, and economic perspectives. For this purpose, we used a simple methodology with a multidisciplinary approach for yield and household survey and scenario analysis in northern Namibia. The yield survey revealed that in ondombe, rice showed a higher yield performance than that of pearl millet and sorghum, even in a drought year. The farm household survey showed that introducing a rice-based mixed cropping to ondombe could help local farmers enhance crop productivity by reducing labour and providing high rice yield. In addition, scenario analysis based on the yield and household surveys conducted in these regions suggested that the introduction of the mixed cropping system to ondombe could compensate for one-fourth of the governmental urgent food import budget even in drought years. Therefore, this system is an effective option for sustainable agricultural production and environmental management in the studied region.

In order to provide more physiological evidence on the mechanisms of interspecific facilitation, phosphatase activities in plant and rhizosphere, root ferric reducing capacity (FR), Fe-solubilizing activity (Fe-SA), and rhizosphere pH were determined. The results of the experiment revealed that biomass yield of peanut and barley was decreased by associated plant species as compared to their monoculture. Rhizosphere chemistry was strongly and differentially modified by the roots of peanut and barley and their mixed culture. In the mixed cropping of peanut/barley, intracellular alkaline and acid phosphatases (AlPase and APase), root secreted acid phosphatases (S-APase), acid phosphatases activity in rhizosphere (RS-APase), and bulk soil (BS-APase) were higher than that of monocultured barley. Regardless of plant species and cropping system, the rhizosphere pH was acidified and concomitantly to this available P and Fe concentrations in the rhizosphere were also increased. The secretion Fe-solubilizing activity (Fe-SA) and ferric reducing (FR) capacity of the roots were generally higher in mixed culture relative to that in monoculture treatments which may improve Fe and Zn nutrition of peanut. Furthermore, mixed cropping improved N and K nutrition of peanut plants, while Ca nutrition was negatively affected by mixed cropping.

Because organic fertilizer normally acts as a slow-release fertilizer, improving its nutrient-use efficiency is important, particularly in terms of nitrogen (N) nutrition. In the present study, we attempted to increase the N-use efficiency of cattle farmyard manure (CM) in the cultivation of pasture grasses by mixed cropping with white lupin (Lupinus albus), which has been reported to decompose organic N in its rhizosphere. Timothy (Phleum pratense) and orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata) were cultivated with or without either lupin or soybean (Glycine max) in pots under three different N treatments (CM, ammonium sulfate, or no N). In the CM treatment, growth was higher in grasses cultivated with lupin than in those cultivated alone or with soybean. Moreover, decomposition of soluble organic N and protease activity in the rhizosphere soil of grasses with CM treatment were enhanced by mixed cropping with lupin. Analyses of microbial activity and bacterial community structure using Biolog EcoPlates suggested that the enhanced decomposition of soluble organic N was facilitated by lupin roots rather than by rhizosphere microorganisms.

Mixed cropped plants were grown in either higher density or lower density. The results of the experiment revealed that dry shoot weight decreased in peanut but increased in maize and barley with associated plant species compared to their monoculture. Shoot Na and Cl concentrations of peanut decreased significantly in both experiments, regardless of higher or lower density. The concentrations of Na also decreased in the shoots of mixed cropped maize and barley, but Cl concentrations increased slightly. The concentration of B significantly decreased in mixed cropping in all. plant species regardless of higher or lower density. Rhizosphere chemistry was strongly and differentially modified by the roots of peanut, maize and barley, and mixed growing. There were significant correlations between the root-secreted acid phosphatases (S-APase), acid phosphatase in rhizosphere (RS-APase) and rhizosphere P concentration (RS-P) in the both experiments. The Fe-solubilizing activity (Fe-SA) and ferric reducing (FR) capacity of the roots were generally higher in mixed culture relative to their monoculture, which improved Fe, Zn and Mn nutrition of peanut. Further, there were also significant correlations among FR, Fe-SA and RS-Fe concentrations. Peanut facilitated P nutrition of maize and barley, while maize and barley improved K, Fe, Zn and Mn nutrition of peanut grown in nutrient-poor saline-sodic and B toxic soil. (c) 2007 Elsevier GmbH.

PREDATOR-PREY ASSOCIATION AMONG SELECTED ARTHROPOD SPECIES IN THE CROPLAND OF MIXED-CROP ZONE (MCZ) AND COTTON-WHEAT ZONE (CWZ)	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES			English	Article						"Croplands; Arthropods; Predator-prey relationship"	"OWLET ATHENE-BRAMA; CENTRAL PUNJAB; HABITS"	Wheat, brassica and fodders (maize, sorghum and alfalfa) were sampled for various arthropod taxa in the mixed-crop (MC) and cotton-wheat (CW) zones of Punjab and predator- prey densities were calculated. Line graphs of predator-prey ratio (p/p) in eight monthly samples were plotted for each predator and its prey species. The most linear horizontal pattern thus obtained revealed an association of a predator to its prey(s). Significance of the association was ascertained by simple linear regression on the relative abundances of both the groups. Findings are helpful in applying a species-specific biological control in nature.	"[Rana, S.

Two trials were planted, one during the short rainy season two months before onset of the dry season and one during the long rainy season in spring. Key pests under study on maize were the noctuid Sesamia calamistis Hampson and the pyralids Eldana saccharina Walker and Mussidia nigrivenella Ragonot, and on cassava, the exotic mealybug, Phenacoccus manihoti Matile-Ferrero and its encyrtid parasitoid Apoanagyrus lopezi De Santis. Both crops received insecticide treatments to assess the crop loss by a pest species. On maize, intercropping with cassava reduced egg and immature numbers of S. calamistis by 67 and 83%, respectively, as a result of reduced host finding by the ovipositing adult moth and of higher egg parasitism by Telenomus spp. Both trials showed similar effects on maize yields: on insecticide-treated maize, intercropping with cassava reduced maize yields by 9-16%, while on untreated maize the net effect of reduced pest density and increased plant competition resulted in zero yield differences; yield losses were lower in intercompared to monocropped maize. For cassava, cropping system had no effect on parasitism by A. lopezi. Yield differences between mono- and intercropped cassava depended on time of harvest: they were large at the beginning and zero at final harvest. Land equivalent ratios were mostly > 1.5 indicating that a maize/cassava mixed crop, protected or unprotected, considerably increased the productivity per unit area of land."

The results of the experiment revealed that sole pop sorghum planted at paired row planting recorded significantly higher grain yield (16.71 q/ha) over other combinations, except sole pop sorghum planted at normal planting method (45 cm 10 cm), which was on par. Quality parameters of pop sorghum did not vary significantly due to inter and mixed cropping systems. Economic analysis of the system revealed that intercropping of pop sorghum with soybean at 2:1 row proportion recorded significantly higher net returns (Rs. 24980/ha) and B:C ratio (2.98) as compared to the rest of the treatment combinations.

Using survey data from Kenya and applying bivariate ordered Probit and bivariate Tobit models, this paper analyzes the tradeoffs in maize residue use as soil mulch and livestock feed in mixed farming systems. Results show that both the proportion and quantity of maize residue used for soil mulch and livestock feed are strongly affected by livestock holding. More livestock holding decreases the proportion of maize residue retained as soil mulch and increases the proportion used as feed. Farmer knowledge about alternative use of crop residues and farmer perception of soil erosion risk (proxied through plot steepness) positively affect the amount of residue farmers retain on maize plots. Results imply that crop residue use assoil mulch in conservation agriculture is challenged in mixed crop-livestock systems and particularly by smallholder farmers owning cross-bred and exotic dairy animals. In general, reducing the use of crop residues as livestock feed through the introduction of alternative feed sources, better extension services on the use of crop residue as soil mulch and designing context specific strategies and interventions could facilitate the adoption and expansion of CA-based practices in mixed crop-livestock systems.

The mixed-crop sequence proved most effective in reducing population of weeds (36.9 and 29.7%) and dry-matter accumulation by weeds (43.8 and 39.1%) and in increasing net profit (128.3 and 29%) compared with single-crop sequence of maize-wheat and soybean-indian mustard respectively. Application of metolachlor @ 0.75 kg/ha pre-emergence in the rainy-season crops and of pendimethalin @ 0.75 kg/ha pre-emergence + isoproturon @ 0.75 kg/ha post-emergence in the winter-season crops showed 9.4% more control of weeds than the use of fluchloralin @ 1.25 kg/ha pre-plant incorporation in the rainy-season crops and isoproturon @ 1.25 kg/ha postemergence in the winter-season crops in both the years. The treatment was comparable with that of weeding by grubber (15 and 30 days after sowing) in minimizing density and dry weight of weeds and in increasing net profit.

Populations of predatory ladybird beetles, Orius sp. and earwigs (Dermaptera) were not significantly influenced by mixed cropping. The density of spiders, however, was significantly higher in the cowpea sole crop than in the cowpea/maize mixture. The population density of M. sjostedti was significantly less in the cowpea/maize mixture than in cowpea sole crop, both inside cages, where predators were excluded, and outside. We concluded that this reduced population density was not the result of enhanced predators' population in the mixture.

Effects of woodchip mulch and barley intercropping on weeds in lentil crops	WEED RESEARCH			English	Article						"Lens culinaris; mixed cropping; sole cropping; weeds; organic farming; yield"	"WATER; YIELD; CHIPS"	"The effect of woodchip mulch on weed infestation and crop yield of lentil (Lens culinaris) was tested in a 2-year field experiment at the organic research station Kleinhohenheim, University of Hohenheim, Germany, in 2009 and 2010. The treatments included no mulch and an amount of 160 m3 ha-1 (fresh matter) woodchips (a mixture of hedgerow shrub species) applied both in spring-sown lentil sole cropping and in lentilbarley mixed cropping systems after the crops were well established. Averaged over the two years, woodchip mulch reduced weed biomass and weed density (plants m-2) in both cropping systems, with a reduction by 43% and 29% (sole), and by 51% and 30% (mixed) respectively. Compared with lentil sole cropping, lentilbarley mixed cropping decreased weed biomass significantly; however, there was no effect on weed density. Lentil grain yield from sole and mixed cropping was 3.03.4 t ha-1 and 2.12.2 t ha-1 in 2009 and 1.01.1 t ha-1 and 0.80.9 t ha-1 in 2010. Barley grain yield was 1.4 t ha-1 in 2009 and 0.7 t ha-1 in 2010. Despite decreasing weeds, the mulch did not improve grain yields of lentil or barley in mixed or sole cropping. In conclusion, the combination of woodchip mulch and mixed cropping is useful to reduce weed infestation in cropping systems where chemical or mechanical weed control is not possible and for crops with a low capacity for competition against weeds."

Impact of phosphorous on biochemical changes in Hordeum vulgare L. in mixed cropping with Chickpea	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						"Cropping system; Nitrogen fixation; Legume; Nutrition; Phosphorous"	"NITROGEN; LEGUME; CATCHMENTS; NUTRITION; QUALITY; WHEAT"	Multiple cropping (i.e. intercropping or mixed cropping) plays an important role in agriculture because of the effective utilization of resources, significantly enhancing crop productivity compared with that of monocultured crops. The study was planed to assess the effect of various concentrations (00, 30, 60, 90 kg ha(-1)) of phosphorous on the biochemical composition of grains of Hordeum vulgare L. (NDB-1050) in mixed cropping system with Chickpea. Phosphorous is an essential ingredient for plants to convert atmospheric N (N-2) into an ammonium (NH4) as a useable form. The available nitrogen content was found more in the year 2006 (131 kg ha(-1)) than year 2005 (105 kg ha(-1)). The results of available nitrogen content were showed that the mixed cropping system enhances N fixation process because phosphorous also influences nodule development through its basic functions in plants as an energy source. Reducing, non reducing and total sugar content of H. vulgare L. were influenced by changes in the phosphorous doses. Maximum protein (13.43%) was obtained at 60 kg P2O5 ha(-1) during the year 2006. Lysine, tryptophan and methionine content were found maximum in year 2006, respectively Total mineral content of grains of plant (0.99 g 100g(-1)) was found maximum by the application of 60 kg P2O5 ha(-1). It is possible that there was an increase in the soil N made available by the leguminous chickpea species, and this could be another reason why there was an increase in Hordeum vulgare L. shoot mass per plant with intercropping with chickpea.

A consequential life cycle assessment of integrated mixed crop-livestock system with a green biorefinery	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"Livestock; Green biorefinery; Biomethane; Beef; Pig; Environmental sustainability"	"GAS EMISSIONS; LAND-USE; CARBON FOOTPRINT; BEEF-PRODUCTION; ENERGY-BALANCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FOSSIL ENERGY; DAIRY-COWS; BIOGAS; LCA"	"This study evaluates environmental impacts of an integrated mixed crop-livestock system with a green biorefinery (GBR). System integration included production of feed crops and green biomasses (Sys-I) to meet the demand of a livestock system (Sys-III) and to process green biomasses in a GBR system (Sys-II). Processing of grass-clover to produce feed protein was considered in Sys-II, particularly to substitute the imported soybean meal. Waste generated from the livestock and GBR systems were considered for the conversion to biomethane (Sys-IV). Digestate produced there from was assumed to be recirculated back to the farmers' field (Sys-I). A consequential approach of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method was used to evaluate the environmental impacts of a combined production of suckler cow calves (SCC) and Pigs, calculated in terms of their live weight (LW). The functional unit (FU) was a basket of two products 1 kg(LW)-SCC+1kg(LW)-Pigs, produced at the farm gate. Results obtained per FU were: 19.6 kg CO2 eq for carbon footprint; 0.11 kg PO4 eq for eutrophication potential, -129MJ eq for non-renewable energy use and -3.9 comparative toxicity units (CTUe) for potential freshwater ecotoxicity. Environmental impact, e.g. greenhouse gas (GHG) emission was primarily due to (i) N2O emission and diesel consumption within Sys-I, (ii) energy input to Sys-II, III and IV, and (iii) methane emission from Sys-III and Sys-IV. Specifically, integrating GBR with the mixed crop-livestock system contributed 4% of the GHG emissions, whilst its products credited 7% of the total impact. Synergies among the different sub-systems showed positive environmental gains for the selected main products. The main effects of the system integration were in the reductions of GHG emissions, fossil fuel consumption, eutrophication potential and freshwater ecotoxicity, compared to a conventional mixed crop-livestock system, without the biogas conversion facility and the GBR.

(Coleoptera: Curculionidae) damage	BULGARIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						"legumes; mixtures; damage; Otiorrhynchus ligustici"	PLANT DIVERSITY	A field trial was carried out at the Institute of Forage Crops, Pleven, Bulgaria to determine the effect of the growing legumes as pure and mixed crops on the damage of Otiorrhynchus ligustici L. The study was performed for the period 2015-2017 on sainfoin, birdsfoot trefoil and alfalfa stands (grown alone) and in mixtures with cocksfoot, sowed under cover of spring forage pea. In mixed crops, the 0. ligustici damage expressed through the number of holes and furrows, as well as their length, was reduced by 22.7, 33.3 and 18.2%, respectively. Alfalfa was the most preference crop by the alfalfa snout beetle and birdsfoot trefoil was less affected. In addition, the distance of the spiral furrows from the root collar and legume root length increased in mixtures by 19.0 and 3.0% to the crops grown alone. The most strongly significant negative effect on the height of legumes had the length of the spiral furrows (-13.1). A less pronounced but significant negative effect had hole number on plant roots (-5.7). The technology of growing of legume crops had an impact on the injury on the plant roots by the soil -inhabiting insects as in mixtures, there are favorable conditions for both, development of plants and reducing the degree of damage.

Mixed-cropping and rice-duck co-culture have been shown to produce ecological benefits and to have positive effects on paddy soil. However, the effects of a combination of mixed cropping with different rice cultivars and duck co-culture on soil nutrients availability and grain yields have not been evaluated. A paddy field experiment was carried out over two rice growing seasons to test these effects. RESULTS Several combinations of rice cultivars, when integrated with duck co-culture, significantly increased the soil organic matter and total nitrogen contents during the rice growing seasons, as compared to mono-cropping systems. In mixed-cropping combined with duck co-culture (MCDC) systems, the soil alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen content ranged from 4.33% to 17.86% higher than that in mono-cropping systems. Similar increases were found for soil available phosphorus (8.71-15.91%) and soil available potassium (8.65-39.43%) contents. Furthermore, MCDC produced higher grain yields and harvest indexes for both study seasons. CONCLUSION The integration of MCDC systems had positive effects on soil nutrient contents of paddy fields, which could, in turn, lead to yield enhancements, as well as additional income for farmers in the form of organic duck meat.

PRODUCTIVITY OF SUMMER LEGUME FORAGES INTERCROPPED WITH MAIZE AS AFFECTED BY MIXED CROPPING IN DIFFERENT SOWING TECHNIQUES	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES			English	Article						"Clusterbean; cowpea; ricebean; intercropping; planting pattern; forage maize"	"ZEA-MAYS; SYSTEM"	This study was conducted during 2003 and 2004 to study the influence of mixed cropping on forage yield and quality. Three summer forage legumes viz. clusterbean, cowpea and ricebean were intercropped with maize in different sowing techniques such as broadcast with blended seed of maize and legume, line sowing with blended seed of maize and legume and line sowing in alternate rows of maize and legume. The experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design with four replications. Highest green forage yield of 13.31 t ha(-1) was obtained from cowpea intercropped with maize in 30 cm spaced lines in alternate rows. This treatment combination also increased the leaf area index of 1.88 and 2.49 during the first and second year of study, respectively leading to improvement in nutritive value as evidenced by its protein contents, compared to other legume intercrop combinations. In conclusion, to get better yield of quality fodder, forage maize should be intercropped with forage legumes, preferably cowpea, under the planting pattern of 30 cm spaced lines in alternate rows.

Mixed cropping has the potential to enhance flood tolerance of drought-adapted grain crops	JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						"Flooding; Oxygen release; Pearl millet; Rice; Sorghum"	"RADIAL OXYGEN LOSS; ROOTS"	"Recently, the occurrences of extreme flooding and drought, often in the same areas, have increased due to climate change. Wetland plant species are known to oxygenate their rhizospheres by releasing oxygen (O-2) from their roots. We tested the hypothesis that wetland species could help upland species under flood conditions; that is, O-2 released from the wetland crop roots would ameliorate rhizosphere O-2-deficient stress and hence facilitate upland crop root function. Flooding tolerance of upland-adapted staple crops-pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) mix-cropped with rice (Oryza spp.) was investigated in glasshouse and laboratory. We found a phenomenon that strengthens the flood tolerance of upland crops when two species-one wetland and one drought tolerant-were grown using the mixed cropping technique that results in close tangling of their root systems. This technique improved the photosynthetic and transpiration rates of upland crops subjected to flood stress (O-2-deficient nutrient culture). Shoot relative growth rates during the flooding period (24 days) tended to be higher under mixed cropping compared with single cropping. Radial oxygen loss from the wetland crop roots might be contributed to the phenomenon observed. Mixed cropping of wet and dryland crops is a new concept that has the potential to overcome flood stress under variable environmental conditions. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

GENOTYPES; ACID-PHOSPHATASE; ORGANIC-ACIDS; WHITE LUPIN; MAIZE; ACQUISITION; DEFICIENCY; EFFICIENCY; PEANUT; WHEAT"	A glasshouse study was conducted to investigate the effects of interspecific complementary and competitive root interactions and rhizosphere effects on phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe) nutrition of mixed grown chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). In order to provide more physiological evidence on the mechanisms of interspecific facilitation, we determined phosphatase activities in plant and rhizosphere, and root ferric reducing capacity (FR), Fe-solubilizing activity (Fe-SA) and rhizosphere pH. The results of the experiment revealed that biomass yield of barley was significantly increased by associated chickpea as compared to monocultured barley, while mixed cropping caused a slight decreases in the biomass yield of chickpea. The rhizosphere was strongly acidified under chickpea and chickpea/barley mixed cropping and this acidification, in turn, increased the available P, Fe(II) and DTPA-Fe concentrations in the rhizosphere. Fe-solubilizing activity (Fe-SA) and ferric reducing (FR) capacity of the roots were higher in both species grown in mixed culture relative to their monoculture which may improve Fe nutrition of both species. Leaf acid phosphatase (APase, EC 3.1.3.2) activity was higher in both plants under mixed cropping that may improve P nutrition of barley by chickpea.

Scarcity of information on existing cropping practices limits the scope of present extension programs. Experiments evaluating potato intercropping systems with maize and faba bean (Vicia faba) were conducted at Yusipang (2700 m) and Kangma (1900 m). Potato yield reductions through intercropping ranged from 0-21 percent depending on year, and location. Variation in planting geometry and maize planting date did not affect potato yield reductions. The land equivalent ratio ranged from 1.03-1.06 for faba bean and from 1.11 to 1.49 for maize intercropping systems. Compared to potato as a sole crop maize intercropping increased gross benefits in Kangma by 12-15 percent with maize plant densities of 2.8 per m2. In Yusipang, gross benefits were not increased through intercropping. Reducing risks of environmental and market impacts favor the use of intercropping systems.

Our hypothesis was that crops included in cropping regimes under the zero tillage system modify the structure of the soil fungi community. Conventional and molecular techniques provide complementary information for the analysis of diversity of fungal species and successful information to accept our hypothesis. The composition of the fungal community varied according to different crops included in the cropping regimes. However, we detected other factors as sources of variation among them, season and sampling depth. The mixed cropping regimes including perennial pastures and one crop per year promote fungal diversity and species with potential benefit to soil and crop. The winter season and 0-5 cm depth gave the largest evenness and fungal diversity. Trichoderma aureoviride and Rhizopus stolonifer could be used for monitoring changes in soil under zero tillage.

Nitrogen nutrition using N-15 isotopic dilution	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						"barley; legume; mixed crop; monocrop; N-2 fixation; N-15; vetch"	"DINITROGEN FIXATION; INTERCROPPING SYSTEMS; MAIZE; RYEGRASS; COWPEA; YIELD; SOIL; N-2-FIXATION; PRODUCTIVITY; METHODOLOGY"	A field experiment on vetch and barley grown in monoculture and in mixed culture was conducted under rain-fed conditions throughout two growing seasons. Plants were either subjected to three sequential harvests, or were harvested only once, at physiological maturity. Our results showed the advantage of a mixed cropping system of vetch and barley over sole cropping under rainfed conditions in terms of dry matter production, total nitrogen content, and land use efficiency expressed as land equivalent ratio (LER). This advantage was more pronounced in the plants harvested once at the end of the season than those subjected to the three successive harvests. Based on this result, a single seasonal rather than several harvests would be recommended under similar rainfed conditions. Nitrogen fixation in vetch measured by the N-15-isotope dilution method, varied with the number of harvests and with cropping system. The percentage of N derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa) of vetch in mixed culture was in most cases higher than in monoculture. The poor competitiveness of vetch for soil N uptake was responsible for the higher soil N uptake by barley and therefore, a higher %Ndfa in vetch.

Long-term continuous monocropping of faba beans increases the incidence of faba bean wilt, while faba bean-wheat intercropping can effectively control it. This study aimed to understand the underlying mechanism of faba bean-wheat intercropping for the control of Fusarium oxysporum and vanillic acid (VA)-promoted occurrence of faba bean wilt. The occurrence of faba bean wilt was investigated among the monocropped and intercropped plants of faba beans in a field experiment. The contents and types of phenolic acids were examined in the rhizosphere soil. Monocropped and intercropped faba beans were examined under the dual stress of F. oxysporum and different concentrations of VA (0, 50, 100, 200 mg/L) to understand the alleviating mechanism of faba bean-wheat intercropping. Exogenous addition of high concentrations of VA significantly inhibited the growth and reproduction of F. oxysporum, but under the dual stress of F. oxysporum and different concentrations of VA, it significantly inhibited the defence enzymes of faba bean roots, stems, and leaves, and rhizosphere soil enzymes. Interestingly, faba bean-wheat intercropping alleviated VA stress and thereby the incidence and disease index of faba bean Fusarium wilt by improving plant resistance and soil enzyme activity. The dual stress of F. oxysporum and VA promotes the occurrence of Fusarium wilt by damaging the defence system of the faba bean root system and rhizosphere soil environment. However, faba bean-wheat intercropping effectively alleviates the autotoxicity of VA by improving the physiological and biochemical resistance of faba beans and soil enzyme activities, and thus controls the occurrence of Fusarium wilt.

Field experiments were conducted for two years to examine the response of two contrasting cultivars each of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) and clusterbean (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba) in pure stands and in mixed pearl millet-clusterbean stands. The differential response of cultivars of both crops to pure and mixed stands resulted in a significant genotype x cropping system interaction. Reduction in seed yield of both clusterbean cultivars was greater in mixed stands with tall and long duration pearl millet MH 179 than with medium statured and early maturing HHB 67. The degree of reduction was greater in Naveen, the branched clusterbean cultivar, than in RGC 197, the single stemmed cultivar. Mixing of pearl millet HHB 67 with medium duration clusterbean cultivar Naveen produced maximum pearl millet equivalent total yield. Higher land equivalent ratios (LERs) were also observed when clusterbean cultivars were mixed with early maturing and short statured pearl millet HHB 67.

Using a 5 x 5 double Latin square design, five Holstein-Friesian crossbred cows in early lactation (30 +/- 15 days) and five Jersey crossbred cows in early lactation (25 +/- 10 days) were given the supplementary mixed crop silage diets at 0.5 kg/l of milk produced over 105 days. Commercial dairy meal and sole maize silage were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Milk yield was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in cows given the dairy meal compared to mixed crop silages; however, milk yield was also significantly higher (P < 0.05) for cows given the three mixed crop silages compared to cows given sole maize silage. Cows given mixed crop silages produced milk of significantly higher protein content (P < 0.05) than those given sole maize silage.

Legume and maize forage were layered equally for ensiling in plastic bags and compressed. Silage fermentation characteristics and nutritive value were determined after 10 days. An insight into the optimum legume-maize ratio was sought by adding soyabean biomass to the maize in varying proportions, increasing from 10 to 80%. None of the mixed crop silages had a dry matter content significantly outside the optimum range of 240-320 g kg(-1) except for that containing 10% grain soyabean. The pH values of the silages range from 3.9 to 6.8 but the amount of ammonia nitrogen as a proportion of total nitrogen was 13.2% or less. Nutritional content of the legume-maize silages showed that protein content significantly improved to between 9.3 (yellow lupin) and 15.3% (forage soyabean) over that of pure maize silage and up to 16.3% with 80% grain soyabean. All silages were more than 50% digestible except velvet bean silage, however, maximum acceptable neutral detergent fibre levels of 65% were exceeded significantly by velvet bean, cowpea and silverleaf silages and silages with < 30% grain soyabean. All silages had metabolisable energy values of over 8 MJ kg(-1) except velvet bean (7.3 MJ kg(-1)). It is concluded that it is possible to produce silage of reasonably good quality, using methods appropriate to small-scale silage technology, from most of the tested legumes when mixed with maize at 50% by volume, and results indicate that the proportion of legume should be at least 40%. Further research using other adapted cereals and ensilage techniques is indicated. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

The adoption of mixed crop/livestock systems could be a tool to increase the cultivation of legume crops in cereal farming systems, particularly in the smallholder farming systems of Southern Europe. This study proposes cereal-legume intercropping as a sustainable intensification tool specifically suitable for crop/livestock mixed systems under rainfed condition. The cereal/grain legume intercropping is used in this study as an alternative to the sole crops in rotation with durum wheat with the assumption that this agronomic technique can still provide the benefits of legume crops in rotation sustaining the subsequent cereal crop production and overcoming the well-known limitations affecting grain legumes sown as sole crop. Pea (Piston sativum L.) and faba bean (Vicia faba L.) were respectively intercropped with barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) for grain production and grown in rotation with durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. subsp. durum) in an area in Southern Italy with typical Mediterranean climate. The present study has demonstrated that cereal legume intercropping can be a source of fodder (both pea and faba bean combinations) and still support yields of the following wheat cash crop. Pea-barley combinations (either additive or replacement design) enabled a better yield performance of the succeeding durum wheat as compared to faba bean-based intercropping. Pea-barley intercrops also reached a greater complementarity in the use of N sources and increased the overall sustainability of the rotation.

Rising input costs, decline in soil quality, and buildup of insect pests, diseases and weeds have threatened the ecological and economic sustainability of crop production. To address those issues, intercropping of cereals with pulse crops could increase total grain production, provide diversity of products, stabilize yield over seasons, reduce economic and environmental risks common in monoculture systems, and thereby enhance sustainability. Here, mixed intercropping of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with faba bean (Vicia faba L.) was compared with sole culture of each species in 2002 and 2003 at Holetta Agricultural Research Center, in the central highlands of Ethiopia. The treatments were sole wheat at a seed rate of 175 kg ha(-1), sole faba bean at a seed rate of 200 kg ha(-1), and an additive series of 12.5, 25, 37.5, 50 and 62.5% of the sole faba bean seed rate mixed with the full sole wheat seed rate. Our results showed that mixed intercropping increased the land equivalent ratio by +3% to +22% over sole cropping. Increasing the faba bean seed rate in the mixture from 12.5 to 62.5% reduced wheat grain yield from 3601 kg ha(-1) to 3039 kg ha(-1) but increased faba bean grain yield from 141 kg ha(-1)to 667 kg ha(-1). Sole culture grain yield exceeded mixed culture grain yield by +5 to +25% for wheat and by +172 to +1190% for faba bean. Nonetheless, we obtained the highest total grain yield of 4031 kg ha(-1), gross monetary value of US$ 823, system productivity index of 4629 and crowding coefficient of 4.70 when wheat at its full seed rate was intercropped with faba bean at a rate of 37.5%. On average, weed biomass was reduced from 40.4 g m(-2) in sole wheat to 31.1 g m(-2) in mixed culture and the chocolate spot disease score was reduced from 5.1 in sole faba bean to 3.4 in mixed culture. In conclusion, intercropping of wheat with faba bean may increase total yield and revenue, reduce weed and disease pressure, increase land-use efficiency, and thereby enhance sustainability of crop production in Ethiopian highlands.

In recent years, habitat management techniques, which aim at increasing plant biodiversity through mixed cropping, have gained increased attention in stem borer control. In the present study, the profitability of mixed cropping of maize with haricot beans at different ratios and the effect on infestation of maize by stem borers, yield and borer parasitism were studied in Melkassa and Mieso, Ethiopia, in a field experiment under natural infestation. In Melkassa, pest infestations were too low for the cropping system to affect pests, plant damage and yields significantly, whereas in Mieso, where the pest densities were high, intercropping of maize with beans at ratios of 1:1 to 2:1 significantly decreased borer densities compared with pure maize stands. Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) and Cotesia flavipes. (Cameron) were the major stem borer and parasitoid species, respectively, recorded both at Melkassa and Mieso. Borer parasitism was higher at Mieso than at Melkassa and tended to increase with the increase of the haricot bean ratio in the intercropping system. Land equivalent ratios of > 1 indicated higher land use efficiency in mixed compared with sole cropping, even if pest densities were low.

Smooth vetch (Vicia dasycarpa L.) as a suitable crop for mixed planting with barley in semi-arid regions	MAEJO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						"smooth vetch; Vicia dasycarpa; annual legumes; biculture; grass pea; Lathyrus Sativus; intercropping"	"LEGUMES; PERFORMANCE; COMPETITION; SYSTEMS; MAIZE; YIELD"	Forage resources during late summer in semi-arid regions are limited, but this limitation could be alleviated by cultivating suitable crops. In this study three seeding rates of smooth vetch (Vicia dasycarpa cv. 'Maragheh') and grass pea (Lathyrus sativus cv. 'Naghadeh local') were tested as pure and mixed stands with shattered barley seeds that were harvested in mid-July from north-west Iran. Several agronomic and quality-related traits were determined when the legumes reached the flowering stage, which coincided with the initial creamy stages of barley. The choice of crop significantly (P < 0.01) affected dry biomass and crude protein. The highest dry biomass (9 t/ha) was obtained in a mixture of barley and vetch at 200 seeds/m(2). The highest protein levels (>20%) were obtained in pure stands of vetch and grass pea although the levels dropped to 18% in some mixtures with barley. The mixture of barley and vetch at 200 seeds/m(2) resulted in the highest land equivalent ratio (1.71) while the highest relative value total (1.35) was obtained from a mixed crop of barley and vetch at 250 seeds/m(2). Thus, a mixed crop of barley and smooth vetch at 200-250 seeds/m(2) is the best crop combination when planted as a summer crop in semi-arid regions.

However, some important food exporting countries, like Australia, are predicted to be vulnerable to climate change and may require transformative adaptations if they are to continue their role in food exportation. This paper assesses the potential impacts of projected climate change by 2030 (0.4-1.6 degrees increase in mean temperature) on Australian mixed crop-livestock systems and examines the consequences of shifts in land allocations to cropping and grazing, in these systems, as an adaptation option. Farm bio-economic simulation models were developed for these mixed enterprise systems in several regions of Australia. These models were based on biophysically coupled crop, pasture, and livestock simulation models that in turn drew on site-based downscaled climate projection datasets. The farm models calculated farm profitability and risk measures. A range of land use changes was investigated. At drier locations facing adverse climate change, results showed a transition towards a greater emphasis on livestock production could be beneficial when assessed against multiple criteria of farm profit, downside financial risk, and environmental damage. We highlight some industry and government actions and policies that could facilitate these preferred adaptation strategies at such locations.

Cereal-legume mixed-cropping is a biological approach to enhancing herbage yield and quality of upgraded animal feed (forage and silage). However, little information exists about the appropriate mixing seeding ratios and its impacts on yield and quality. Therefore, this study was conducted to examine the forage yield and nutritional quality of maize (Zea mays L.) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in mono-and mixed-cropping approaches at the seeding proportions of 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 45:55, 25:75, and 0:100 in 2019 and 2020 in Northwestern Loess Plateau region. A randomized complete block design with four replicates was used in this experiment. The results indicated that forage quality was significantly affected by the mixture ratios. The land equivalent ratio (LER) of all mixed-cropping treatments greater than 1.0, in which maize-common bean at the 50:50 seeding ratio achieved higher LER (1.46) than that of other treatments, showing that mixed-cropping combination systems are better users of land resources. Laboratory forage quality analysis and Pearson correlation analysis showed that the relative feed value had highly positive correlation with total digestible nutrients and relative forage quality in mixed-cropping treatments. Our results showed that fresh forage yield and dry matter yield were higher in monocropped maize forage than in other intercropped forages, whereas crude protein yield was lower compared with other mixed cropping forages. After 60 days of ensiling, the highest organic acid profile and ammonia-nitrogen were observed in M25:CB75 silage compared with other silages. The highest ensilability of fermentation coefficient was also found in M50:CB50 compared with other intercropped silages. Regarding forage preservation, silage showed higher contents of crude protein, relative feed value and lower crude fiber, water-soluble carbohydrate neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber contents than forage. This study determined that the ratios of maize-common bean 25:75 and 50:50 were the most desirable mixture ratios among mixed-cropped forage and silage based on chemical composition and quality analysis for livestock feeding.

Zhongdan No. 2) and faba bean (Vicia faba L. cv. Linxia Dacaidou) were investigated in a field experiment. A root barrier study was also set up in which belowground partitions were used to determine the contribution of interspecific root interactions to crop nutrient uptake. Nitrogen uptake by intercropped faba bean was higher than (no P fertilizer) or similar to (33 kg P ha(-1) of P fertilizer) that by sole faba bean during the early growth stages (first to third sampling) of faba bean, and was similar to (no P fertilizer) or higher than (33 kg P ha(-1) of P fertilizer) that by sole faba bean at maturity. Nitrogen uptake by intercropped maize did not differ from that by sole maize at maturity, except when P fertilizer was applied. Intermingling of maize and faba bean roots increased N uptake by both crop species by about 20% compared with complete or partial separation of the root systems. Intercropping also led to some improvement in P nutrition of both crop species. Maize shoot P concentrations were similar to those of sole maize during early growth stages and became progressively higher until they were significantly higher than those of sole maize at maturity. Intercropping increased shoot P concentration in faba bean at the flowering stage and in maize at maturity, and increased P uptake by both plant species at maturity. Phosphorus uptake by faba bean with root intermingling (no root partition) was 28 and 11% higher than with complete (plastic sheet) and partial (400 mesh nylon net) root barriers, respectively. Maize showed similar trends, with corresponding P uptake values of 29 and 17%. Unlike N and P, K nutrition was not affected by the presence of root barriers.

Methods The fields were managed without or with annual P fertilizer (40 kg P ha(- 1)), continuously growing sole cropping or intercropping of maize and faba bean. Soil samples (0-200 mm) were collected at the start of the experiment and eight years later, and we evaluated P fractions using sequential fractionation. Results Maize/faba bean intercropping had an average land equivalent ratio (LER) of 1.2, a similar P content as sole maize, while both acquired more P than sole faba bean. Compared with the original soil P fractions in 2009, three cropping systems, regardless of P fertilization, depleted the labile P pool (Resin-P and NaHCO3-P-i), while Residual-P and NaHCO3-P-o accumulated. Eight years of no P input showed sole maize mainly depleted NaOH-P-i and conc. HCl-P-i, sole faba bean depleting NaOH-P-o, while intercropping depleted the most abundant P fraction, 1 M HCl-P-i, in addition to NaOH-P-i. However, long-term P application caused the cropping systems to accumulate 1 M HCl-P-i while depleting the conc. HCl-P-o fraction; both sole faba bean and intercropping showed accumulation of NaOH-P-i, while depleting NaOH-P-o. Conclusions Long-term appropriate P input enhanced the mineralization of mod-labile and non-labile organic P and accumulation of mod-labile inorganic P. Sole maize consistently depleted inorganic P and sole faba bean without P input depleted organic P, while intercropping accessed P pools varying with P input."

This finding formed the basis for a series of experiments conducted in Costa Rica to evaluate the hypothesis that mixed cropping systems create a physical environment that influences vector movement and consequently the spread of leafhopper-borne pathogens. The principle finding of the study is that both the mixture of plants and planting density have little influence on the spread of pathogens by Dalbulus maidis, an oligophagus leafhopper which prefers maize, within maize and bean single and mixed cropping systems. Leafhopper flight activity proved similar for high and low density monocultures and bicultures. The number of leafhoppers immigrating to and emigrating from a field appears dependent on the size of the field, not the density of maize plants. Single and mixed crops with the same density of maize plants were equally prone to damage by pathogens carried by leafhoppers. The lower percentage infection in high density than in low density maize treatments resulted from fewer vectors per plant in the former.

Multispecies cropping systems contribute to sustainable agriculture with multiple ecosystem services. Effects of intercropping of organically managed maize and faba beans to silage on acquisition of mineral nutrients in shoots of both crops and on leaf spot progression in faba beans were investigated. Three field experiments were performed with maize and faba bean intercropped or grown separately. Intercropping increased shoot concentrations of K, Ca, Mg, Na, S and B in faba bean, and shoot concentrations of Cu, Zn and Mo in maize. Thus, the ecological complementary effects enhance feed quality. Disease severity index (DSI) of leaf spots in faba beans was reduced by intercropping by 42-57 %, partly due to an increased Cu acquisition at sites where the Cu availability was low. There was a significant negative linear relationship between Cu concentration in shoots and DSI of leaf spots. Total uptake of mineral nutrients per land area was greater in the intercropping system with a total LER > 1 for all mineral nutrients, except for P, Ca and Mn at one of the sites. Increased nutrient use efficiency, due to facilitative uptake from the soil, and the production of crops with higher contents of minerals compared with monocropping, are benefits of intercropped maize and faba beans.

A Case Study from the Mixed Crop-Livestock Production Systems of the Moroccan Drylands	AGRONOMY-BASEL			English	Article						"residue retention; mixed crop-livestock systems; downside risk exposure; adoption and impact; drylands; Morocco"	"MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; FOOD SECURITY; FARMING SYSTEMS; TILLAGE; MANAGEMENT; NITROGEN; FERTILIZATION; AVAILABILITY"	Conservation agriculture (CA) involving zero tillage, crop diversification, and residue retention is considered a panacea for several interrelated problems in agricultural production. However, in the mixed crop-livestock production systems of the drylands, crop residues have great significance as sources of animal feed, posing a major challenge in the promotion of CA. While the economic benefits and the drivers of adoption of zero tillage and rotation have been well documented, the literature on the economics of residue retention (RR), especially in the drylands, is scanty. By applying the endogenous switching regression model to a case study of 2296 wheat fields in Morocco, this paper provides evidence on the socio-economic impacts of residue retention. Between 30% and 60% and above 60% of crop residues were retained respectively on 35% and 14% of wheat fields. These levels of residue retention led to 22% and 29% more yields, 25% and 32% higher gross margins and 22% and 25% more consumption of wheat, respectively. Retention of above 60% residue reduces both downside risk and variability of yield while lower levels of residue retention have mixed effects. Residue retention is economically and biophysically beneficial even for owners of livestock as the monetary value of the additional grain yield more than offsets the cost of purchasing an equivalent amount of feed from the market-all providing good economic justification for residue retention. Our findings show that economic reasons are not barriers for adoption of residue retention, but risk factors and absence of alternative feed sources might. The policy implication of our results is that there are high incentives for Morocco and other similar countries in North Africa and West Asia to invest in the development and/or import of alternative feed sources, introducing crop insurance, and raising the awareness of the economic, biophysical and environmental benefits of residue retention among farmers.

Faba bean and barley sole crops were also included. Corn poppy dry weights in barley sole crop or faba bean-barley intercrops were 83 to 85% or 50 to 99%, respectively, lower than that in faba bean sole crop. Total dry matter (DM) and total crude protein (CP) yields of faba bean-barley intercrops were, in most cases, not significantly affected by corn poppy competition. The results obtained in both locations indicated that intercropping faba bean with barley could be an alternative practice to that of faba bean sole crop in sustainable production systems, because of its greater productivity, balanced nutritive value and competitiveness against aggressive weeds such as corn poppy.

Its dairy farms are the most numerous: some produce only milk in mountainous areas, while others produce milk in the lowlands using mixed crop-livestock systems. The attractiveness of these industries remains strong. A multidisciplinary study was carried out as part of a French-Swiss research project. This work led to an innovative advisory tool for improving the earnings of dairy farmers based on an analysis of farm structure. Using survey data (n=186), multidimensional statistical analyses were carried out, and key variables were identified. The categories defined here (Hay-Regrowth and Maize Silage systems) can be easily used by agricultural advisors. This study identified strategic tools focused on livestock (rearing percentage, milk yield) and land use (land dedicated to grains or temporary grassland) that can help increase gross operating surplus.

Productivity, technical efficiency and cropping patterns in the savanna zone of Nigeria	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"Productivity; technical efficiency; small-scale farmers; stochastic frontier production; mixed cropping"		The productivity and technical efficiency (T.E) of small-scale farmers in Nigeria were studied using the stochastic frontier production function analysis. Primary data was collected using multi-stage sampling techniques, from some villages in Niger State, Nigeria. Results showed that farmers were in the rational stage of production (stage II) as depicted by the returns to scale (RTS) of 0.27. The technical efficiency of the sole maize farmers was lower (0.5266) compared to that of the mixed (yam/maize) cropping farmers (0.7172). A mean efficiency of 0.622 was observed for all farmers. Over 50% of the mixed crop farmers had T.E. exceeding 0.70 as compared to 100% sole farmers who had less than 0.60. The study further showed that years of schooling, farming experience and cropping pattern positively affected T. E while increase in the age led to decrease in T.E.	"[Amos, T.

This study explored the effects of these two factors on the departure rate of winged Uroleucon ambrosiae (Thomas) from bean plants, Phaseolus vulgaris L., in monocultures and in mixtures with maize, Zea mays L., in Costa Rica. Residence half-time, herein defined as the length of time required for half the winged aphids placed on a plant to depart, was shorter in mixed crops than in bean monocultures and was negatively correlated with wind speed at bean canopy level. Residence half-time had no detectable correlation with the number of interplant leaf bridges. Departure by flight, based on these findings, may have been more common than walking from plant to plant via leaf bridges. Maize in mixed crops formed barriers that reduced wind speed at bean canopy level, leading U. ambrosiae alatae to depart more readily from bean plants in bean-maize mixtures than in bean monocultures.

Background: Broomrape (Orobanche crenata Forsk.) is a major threat to faba bean and an important danger parasite. An intercropping is a necessity to curb the spread and progress of the parasite before it leads to much more economic losses. The current study was aimed to evaluate intercropping of fenugreek with faba bean under two plant densities of both crops on broomrape incidence to increase faba bean yield, land usage and economic return in heavy soil infestation of broomrape. Methods: This study was carried out at Giza Agricultural Research Station (Lat. 30 degrees 00' 30 '' N, Long. 31 degrees 12' 43 '' E, 26 m a.s.l), Agricultural Research Center, Giza, Egypt. During the winter season of 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 seasons, sixteen treatments were the combinations between two ridge widths (60 narrow and 120 cm wide) and six cropping systems (50% faba bean + 50% fenugreek, 100% faba bean + 50% fenugreek, 50% faba bean + 100% fenugreek, 100% faba bean + 100% fenugreek, 50% sole faba bean and 100% sole faba bean), as well as sole plantings of fenugreek under heavy soil infestation of broomrape. A split-plot design with three replicates was used. Ridge widths were assigned in the main plots and cropping systems were arranged in sub plots. Result: Growing faba bean plants in wide ridges had physical barriers with stamping of the vascular system against the parasite. 50% faba bean + 100% fenugreek had higher soil total phenols in faba bean rhizosphere than the others. Growing 50% faba bean + 100% fenugreek in wide ridges had lower number of spikes per m(2) and spikes dry weight per m(2), meanwhile, growing 100% faba bean + 100% fenugreek in wide ridges had higher seed yields of both crops per ha, land usage and economic return. Growing two rows of faba bean (100% of sole cropping) in both sides of wide ridge (120 cm width) with four rows of fenugreek (100% of sole cropping) in middle of the ridge could be an integrated control strategy to increase faba bean productivity, land usage and economic return under heavily soil infested of broomrape.

Here, we simulated the consequences of lucerne use for a standard mixed crop-livestock farm (spanning 175 ha of usable farm area, with 75 ha dedicated to grain and oilseed crops; annual milk production of 1 million litres). For the dairy cattle's winter diet, 11 ha of maize were replaced by 11 ha of lucerne. A seven-year period was simulated; during this time, the sale prices of farm products (milk and grain crops) and the cost of farm supplies (fuel and feed) fluctuated. Concentrate self-sufficiency rose from 40% to 61% for dry matter and from 15% to 30% for crude protein.

Intercropping effects were detected, with land equivalent ratio values of 1.21-1.23 based on total (grain+straw) yield and 1.13-1.34 based on grain yield. When two rows of maize were intercropped with two rows of faba bean, both total yield and grain yield of both crop species were significantly higher than those of sole maize and faba bean on an equivalent area basis. When two rows of pea ( Pisum sativum L. cv. Beijing No. 5) were intercropped with two rows of faba bean, neither total yield nor grain yield of faba bean was higher than of sole faba bean on an equivalent area basis. Interspecific competition between maize and faba bean was relatively weak, with mean relative crowding coefficients of 0.99-1.02 for maize and 1.55-1.59 for faba bean. The microplot experiment in which partitions were placed between root systems showed a significant positive yield effect on maize when the root systems intermingled freely (no partition) or partly (400 mesh nylon net partition) compared with no interspecific root interaction (plastic sheet partition).

Smart Investments in Sustainable Food Production: Revisiting Mixed Crop-Livestock Systems	SCIENCE			English	Editorial Material							"INTENSIFICATION; SCIENCE"	Farmers in mixed crop-livestock systems produce about half of the world's food. In small holdings around the world, livestock are reared mostly on grass, browse, and nonfood biomass from maize, millet, rice, and sorghum crops and in their turn supply manure and traction for future crops. Animals act as insurance against hard times, and supply farmers with a source of regular income from sales of milk, eggs, and other products. Thus, faced with population growth and climate change, small-holder farmers should be the first target for policies to intensify production by carefully managed inputs of fertilizer, water, and feed to minimize waste and environmental impact, supported by improved access to markets, new varieties, and technologies.

We studied P uptake and soil pH, carboxylate concentration, and microbial community structure in the rhizosphere of maize, faba bean, and white lupin in an acidic soil with 0-250 mg P (kg(-1) soil) as KH2PO4 (KP) or FePO4 (FeP) with species grown alone or intercropped. All plant species increased the pH compared to unplanted control, particularly faba bean. High KP supply (> 100 mg P kg(-1)) significantly increased carboxylate concentration in the rhizosphere of maize. The carboxylate composition of the rhizosphere soil of maize and white lupin was significantly affected by P form (KP or FeP), whereas, this was not the case for faba bean. In maize, the carboxylate composition of the rhizosphere soil differed significantly between intercropping and monocropping. Yield and P uptake were similar in monocropping and intercropping. Monocropped faba bean had a greater concentration of phospholipid fatty acids in the rhizosphere than that in intercropping. Intercropping changed the microbial community structure in faba bean but not in the other corps. The results show that P supply and P form, as well as intercropping can affect carboxylate concentration and microbial community composition in the rhizosphere, but that the effect is plant species-specific. In contrast to previous studies in alkaline soils, intercropping of maize with legumes did not result in increased maize growth suggesting that the legumes did not increase P availability to maize in this acidic soil.

However, the effects of belowground interactions on the yields of intercrops in faba bean-maize relay intercropping system are still unclear. In this study, field and pot experiments were conducted, and the biomass, yield, nutrient accumulation and photosynthetic parameters of intercrops were determined to analyze the effects of belowground interactions and relay intercropping. In the field experiments, the yield and biomass of faba bean and maize in the relay intercropping system was significantly increased compared with the monocropping. The relay intercropping promoted the accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorus in faba bean and maize but showed no effect on potassium accumulation. In the pot experiments, no barrier treatment significantly increased the nutrient accumulation of faba bean and maize, nutrient content in soil, photosynthesis, maize, yield, biomass, plant height, 100-grain weight of faba bean and maize. In summary, relay intercropping increased nutrient accumulation, photosynthesis, biomass and yield of crops. The belowground interactions of intercrops could provide good soil fertility conditions for crop growth. The results can provide references for high-yield cultivation of crops and sustainable development of agriculture.

Mixed cropping with maize combined with moderate UV-B radiations lead to enhanced flavonoid production and root growth in faba bean	JOURNAL OF PLANT INTERACTIONS			English	Article						"root interaction; interspecific facilitation; moderate UV-B radiation; flavonoids; faba bean; maize"	"SIGNALING COMPONENT UVR8; AUXIN TRANSPORT; VICIA-FABA; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; NITROGEN-FIXATION; ACID-DERIVATIVES; WATER-STRESS; ARABIDOPSIS; PLANT; RESPONSES"	Flavonoids have recently been proposed to function as developmental regulators and/or signaling molecules under biotic or abiotic stress. The aim of this study was to determine the composition and concentration of fiavonoid aglycones (kaempferol, luteolin, and quercetin) in faba bean shoots and roots, as affected by interspecific root interactions with maize and moderate UV-B radiation. Independent of the UV-B treatment, interspecific root interactions with maize enhanced the concentration of both quercetin and luteolin in the faba bean shoots and roots by 50 and 97.8%, respectively, and improved the root length by 14.6%. In addition, moderate UV-B radiation facilitated a systematic increase of both aglycones in both shoots and roots without affecting plant growth. To our knowledge, this report is the first work documenting the response of faba bean flavonoids to interspecific root interactions with maize and moderate UV-B radiation, and it provides a new perspective for understanding interspecific interactions.

J	Kebede, E				Kebede, Erana			Grain legumes production and productivity in Ethiopian smallholder agricultural system, contribution to livelihoods and the way forward	COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE			English	Review						"crop rotation; grain legumes; intercropping; nutrition; productivity; soil fertility"		Grain legumes are an important component of agricultural crops contributing to smallholder crop production, nutrition and income across the world. Ethiopia has a favorable and diverse agro-ecology for grain legumes production making the country one of the major grain legumes producing and supplying country. The annual production and productivity of grain legumes has been showing an increasing trend which is mainly attributed to high demand for nutrition and strong prices resulting from local and international market. Faba beans, haricot beans (white and red), field peas and chickpeas are the four leading grain legumes both in area of production and grain yield. In agricultural system of the country, legumes have been used in a mixed cropping system with cereals and other crops, mainly in crop rotation and intercropping. Grain legumes have also been used for various purposes including improving food and nutrition security, generation of income, soil fertility improvement, providing livestock feed, soil erosion control, water conservation and as a source of fuel. Despite their widespread production and multiple benefits, the production and productivity of grain legumes in Ethiopia is below potential. This is mainly due to low input usage, limited availability of seed, market problems and poor extension services. However, the country has huge potential to produce different grain legumes. Therefore, Ethiopia should more recognize the grain legume sectors, promotes modern agronomic practices and improved legume technologies that boost the production and productivity.

Dual-purpose crops hold huge potential to ease this pressure and simultaneously improve food and fodder availability in these systems. We investigated farmers' preferences for dual-purpose maize, sorghum, and groundnut traits, and analyzed linkages of stated trait preferences with production of dual-purpose crops and adoption of improved varieties involving 645 households from two districts in Zimbabwe. The three target crops cover more than 75% of households' cropping lands. Highly preferred stated traits of dual-purpose crops include yield, disease resistance, and drought tolerance. Highly appreciated feed attributes encompass stover yield and digestibility. The adoption of improved varieties is high for maize but low for sorghum and groundnut. Trait preferences are correlated with the production of dual-purpose crops and the adoption of improved varieties of the crops. However, the strengths of these correlations differ for maize, sorghum, and groundnuts. We discuss these linkages and suggest why crop improvement programs should reconcile trade-offs between grain and feed attributes to support mixed crop-livestock systems in Zimbabwe successfully.

A preliminary whole-farm economic analysis of perennial wheat in an Australian dryland farming system	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						"dual-purpose; perennial crop; MIDAS; profitability; sustainability; benefit-cost"	"GRAIN CROPS; SOUTHERN AUSTRALIA; WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; WATER-USE; AGRICULTURE; MANAGEMENT; GROWTH; YIELD; SALINITY; PASTURES"	The development of perennial wheat could have a number of advantages for improving the sustainability of Australian dryland agricultural systems. The profitability that might be expected from perennial wheat of different types was investigated using MIDAS (Model of an Integrated Dryland Agricultural System), a bioeconomic model of a mixed crop/livestock farming system. Although perennial wheat may produce a lower grain yield and quality than annual wheat, it is expected inputs of fertiliser, herbicide and sowing costs will be lower. Perennial wheat used solely for grain production was not selected as part of an optimal farm plan under the standard assumptions. In contrast, dual-purpose perennial wheat that produces grain and additional forage during summer and autumn than annual wheat can increase farm profitability substantially (AU$20/ha over the whole farm) and 20% of farm area was selected on the optimal farm plan under standard assumptions. Forage from perennial wheat replaced stubble over summer and grain supplement at the break of season and increased farm stock numbers. The additional value added by grazing also reduced the relative yield required for perennial wheat to be profitable. This analysis suggests perennial wheat used for the dual purposes of grain and forage production could be developed as a profitable option for mixed crop/livestock producers. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Field experiments were conducted with three planting patterns (monocropped wheat [MW], monocropped faba bean [MB], and wheat and faba bean intercropping) and three rates of P fertilization (0 [P0], 45 [P45], and 90 kg P2O5 ha(-1) [P90]). The biomass of faba bean and wheat was sequentially sampled 10 and 11 times, respectively, during each growing season, and growth parameters and species interaction were simulated and calculated. Wheat and faba bean suffered different competition pressures in intercropping, but intercropping still showed yield advantages, and the interaction between wheat and faba bean was not regulated by P rate under moderate soil P fertility. Wheat was not dominant in intercropping until faba bean reached its maximum growth rate (R-max). The R-max, maximum biomass production, and grain yield of wheat increased by 12 to 18, 4 to 16, and 16 to 17%, respectively, when wheat was intercropped with faba bean relative to MW, and all of these variables for intercropped wheat at P45 were equal to those for MW at P90 due to the interactions between planting pattern and P rate.

Vetch-wheat crops are superior to vetch-oat crops in terms of protein yield	ACTA AGRICULTURAE SCANDINAVICA SECTION B-SOIL AND PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						"Avena sativa; intercropping; mixed crops; protein content; protein yield; seed density; seed weights of cereals; Triticum aestivum; Vicia sativa"	"INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; N-2 FIXATION; PEA-BARLEY; DINITROGEN FIXATION; WHITE CLOVER; N FERTILIZER; NITROGEN; LEGUMES; DILUTION; N-15"	The formation of yield in two different combinations: vetch with wheat or oats, and the effect of vetch on yield potential of cereals has been investigated in Estonian field experiments over three years. We found that the inclusion of vetch seed in cereal seed and increase of its seed density led to considerable decrease in the yield of the cereal component (R = 0.980-0.998). The adverse effect of vetch on cereal yield led to a reduction in wheat yield by up to 1861 kg ha(-1) on average for the three years, and in oats yield by up to 1413 kg ha(-1). One reason for the decreases in cereal yields was the formation of smaller grains in cereals under increased vetch seed densities. As a three-year average, the wheat 1000-seed weight decreased by up to 6.3 g while the corresponding figure for oats under identical conditions was 2.5 g. The inclusion of vetch in a crop and the increase of its seed density led to a substantial increase in the protein content of cereal grains. In oats, the change in grain protein content was smaller. At the same time, the maximum protein yield per area unit in cereals was obtained from their monocultures. In a mix with vetch, the amounts of nitrogen consumed by cereals decreased and protein yield of cereals per area unit reduced at higher vetch seed densities. Vetch-cereal mixes had an advantage over cereal monocultures as far as protein yield was concerned. In vetch-wheat and vetch-oats mixes the maximum protein yield was 500 kg ha(-1) and 438 kg ha(-1), respectively, on average for the three years. Of the two combinations, vetch-oats mixed crop gave the highest yield of grain, whereas the higher mixed crop yield resulted from the oats component. Oats is somewhat more competitive with vetch than wheat. Vetch-wheat mixed crop gave the highest protein yield because the protein content of wheat grains was higher than oat grains. Legume-cereal mixes are particularly suited for the conditions of organic farming as they ensure a relatively good harvest and a high protein yield.

Optimizing edible fungal growth and biodegradation of inedible crop residues using various cropping methods	BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						"biodegradation; cropping pattern; edible white-rot fungi; lignocellulose"	DEGRADATION	Long-term manned space flights to Mars require the development of an advanced life support (ALS) ecosystem including efficient food crop production, processing and recycling waste products thereof. Using edible white rot fungi (EWRF) to achieve effective biomass transformation in ALS requires optimal and rapid biodegradative activity oil lignocellulosic wastes. We investigated the mycelial growth of Lentinula edodes and Pleurotus ostreatus on processed residues of various crops under various cropping patterns. In single cropping, mycelial growth and fruiting in all strains were significantly repressed on sweet potato and basil. However, growth of the strains was improved when sweet potato and basil residues were paired with rice or wheat straw. Oyster mushroom (Pleurotus) strains were better than shiitake (L. edodes) strains under single, paired, and mixed cropping patterns. Mixed cropping further eliminated the inherent inhibitory effect of sweet potato, basil, or lettuce on fungal growth. Co-cropping fungal species had a synergistic effect on rate of fungal growth, substrate colonization, and fruiting. Use of efficient cropping methods may enhance fungal growth, fruiting, biodegradation of crop residues, and efficiency of biomass recycling. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

GENOTYPES; N USE; YIELD; PLANT; DEFICIENCY; EFFICIENCY"	Below-ground niche complementarity in legume-cereal intercrops may improve resource use efficiency and root adaptability to environmental constraints. However, the effect of water limitation on legume rooting and nodulation patterns in intercropping is poorly understood. To advance our knowledge of mechanisms involved in water-limitation response, faba bean (Vicia faba L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were grown as mono- and intercrops in soil-filled plexiglass rhizoboxes under water sufficiency (80% of water-holding capacity) and water limitation (30% of water-holding capacity). We examined whether intercropping facilitates below-ground niche complementarity under water limitation via interspecific root stratification coupled with modified nodulation patterns. While no significant treatment effects were measured in intercropped wheat growth parameters, water limitation induced a decrease in shoot and root biomass of monocropped wheat. Likewise, shoot biomass and height, and root length of monocropped faba bean significantly decreased under water limitation. Conversely, water limitation stimulated root biomass of intercropped faba bean in the lower soil layer (15-30 cm soil depth). Similarly, total nodule number of faba bean roots as well as nodule number in the lower soil layer increased under intercropping regardless of water availability. Under water limitation, intercropping also led to a significant increased nodule biomass (48%) in the lower soil layer as compared to monocropping. The enhanced nodulation in the lower soil layer and the associated increase in root and shoot growth provides evidence for a shift in niche occupancy when intercropped with wheat, which improves water-limited faba bean performance.

There have been numerous studies on nutrient acquisition by crops in legume/non-legume intercropping systems, but few on nutrient uptake in cereal/cereal intercropping. This paper describes a field experiment in which integrated wheat/maize and maize/faba bean systems were compared with sole wheat and sole faba bean cropping to assess the effects of intercropping on nutrient uptake by wheat, maize, and faba bean under various application rates of nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) fertilizers. Results show that both N and P fertilizers and intercropping enhanced N uptake by wheat, while only P fertilizer and intercropping increased P acquisition by wheat. The advantage of N uptake by border rows of wheat intercropped with maize declined with increasing N fertilizer application rate, but that of P acquisition was not affected by P fertilizer. The amounts of both N and P taken up by maize intercropped with faba bean were much higher than those by maize intercropped with wheat throughout the period of intercropping. Both fertilization and intercropping did not influence the N and P uptake by faba bean.

RAPA; NUTRITIVE CHARACTERISTICS; GRAIN-YIELD; PRATYLENCHUS-THORNEI; DIFFERENT PERIODS; LAMB PERFORMANCE"	"Forage brassicas are currently widely used in temperate-humid livestock systems; however, they offer potential to diversify crop rotation and forage options in the drier, mixed crop-livestock zone of Australia. A literature review highlighted that in these hotter and more arid environments, forage brassicas are more likely to fit as autumn-sown forage crop where they offer an energy-rich, highly digestible feed source that could be used during periods of low production and nutritive value of other forage sources. However, brassicas can also accumulate several anti-nutritional compounds that require gradual introduction to livestock diets, thereby reducing potential health risks and optimising animal performance. Preliminary experimental and commercial evaluations in subtropical Australia found high production of some forage brassica genotypes (>5 t DM/ha with growth rates of 50-60 kg DM/ha.day), comparable or superior to widely used forage cereal or forage legume options. Several forage brassicas showed moderate to high resistance to the root-lesion nematode, Pratylenchus thornei, and hence are likely to provide break-crop benefits compared with susceptible species (e.g. wheat). Together, this evidence suggests that forage brassicas have significant potential for wider use in crop-livestock farming systems in Australia. However, research is needed to identify genotypic adaptation and to match different forage brassica genotypes to production environments or system niches, especially some of the new genotypes that are now available. There is also a need to develop regionally-relevant recommendations of agronomic and grazing management that optimise forage and animal production, and mitigate potential animal health risks."

Sequential cropping significantly enhanced the total forage yield to 12.4 Mg ha(-1) for oats, compared to single cropping (8.7 Mg ha(-1)). The seed germination percentage was significantly increased in compacted soil after sowing, which also leads to higher hay yield. Mixed sowing of oats with common vetch brought a protein-rich harvest with a higher or equivalent yield than single-sown oats. The crude protein concentration of the whole forage decreased with the decrease in the seeding ratio of common vetch; the seeding ratio of 70% oat and 100% common vetch achieved a higher forage yield and protein content than the other mixtures studied.

The aim of these experiments was to determine whether manipulation of maize root growth could improve the productivity of the two intercropping systems. Two near isogenic maize hybrids (the larger-rooted T149 and smaller-rooted T222) were intercropped with faba bean and wheat, under conditions of high- and low-P availability. The larger-rooted T149 showed greater competitive ability than the smaller-rooted T222 in both maize/faba bean and maize/wheat intercropping systems. The higher competitive ability of T149 improved the productivity of the maize/faba bean intercropping system in P-sufficient conditions. In maize/wheat intercropping systems, root growth, shoot biomass, and P uptake of maize were inhibited by wheat, regardless of the P-supply. Compared with T222, the larger-rooted T149 suffered less in the intercropping systems. The total biomass of the maize/wheat intercropping system was higher for wheat/T149 than for wheat/T222 under low-P conditions. These data suggested that genetic improvement of maize root size could enhance maize growth and its ability to compete for P resources in maize/faba bean and maize/wheat intercropping systems. In addition, depending on the P availability, larger maize roots could increase the productivity of intercropping systems.

J	"Meissner, A; Granzow, S; Wemheuer, F; Pfeiffer, B"				"Meissner, Annika; Granzow, Sandra; Wemheuer, Franziska; Pfeiffer, Birgit"			The cropping system matters - Contrasting responses of winter faba bean (Vicia faba L.) genotypes to drought stress	JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						"Intercropping; Faba bean genotype; Vicia faba; Drought stress; Water deficit; Re-irrigation"	"RELATIVE WATER-CONTENT; USE EFFICIENCY; GROWTH; WHEAT; YIELD; COMPETITION; PLANTS; TOLERANCE; NITROGEN; PROLINE"	Intercropping of legumes and cereals provides many ecological advantages and contributes to a sustainable agriculture. These agricultural systems face ongoing shifts in precipitation patterns and seasonal drought. Although the effect of drought stress on legumes has been frequently studied, knowledge about water deficits influencing legumes under different cropping systems is still limited. Therefore, we investigated the impact of water deficit and re-irrigation on two winter faba bean genotypes (S_004 and S_062) and winter wheat (var. Genius) in pure and intercropped stands under greenhouse conditions. Various physiological and biochemical parameters, such as canopy surface temperature, leaf relative water content and proline content, were collected at three time points (beginning of water deficit, end of water deficit, after re-irrigation). In addition, water use efficiency (WUE) was analyzed at the end of the experiment. The overall drought stress tolerance was determined as conceptual analysis of all measured parameters. Water deficit significantly affected WUE, surface temperature and proline content of both winter faba bean genotypes. Interestingly, intercropping with wheat resulted in an overall high drought tolerance of genotype S_004, while genotype S_062 had a high drought tolerance in pure stands. Under water deficit, pure stands of S_062 substantially increased WUE by 30.5%. Intercropping of genotype S_004 increased the dry matter per plant by 31.7% compared to pure stands under water deficit. Contrary, intercropping of genotype S_062 did not improve the dry matter production. Our findings indicate that genotype S_004 benefits from resource complementarity in intercropping systems with wheat, whereas S_062 is better suitable for pure stands due to competitive effects. Thus, our study highlights that the drought tolerance of winter faba bean genotypes depends on the cropping system, leading to a demand for drought-adapted cultivars specifically selected for intercropping.

Traditional livestock feeding practices in Northern Karnataka	INDIAN JOURNAL OF TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE			English	Article						"livestock; traditional knowledge; livestock feeding practices; Karnataka"		A study was conducted in four villages of Dharwad district of Karnataka to elicit information on traditional livestock feeding practices followed by the farmers. Focused PRA tools coupled with personal interview technique were used to document the traditional practices. The study revealed that farmers preferred to feed cotton seed cake, hay of mixed crop and they did not prefer to feed dry maize stover and paddy straw. They have an established daily feeding pattern for bullocks and milch animals. Strong association was found between farmers' practices and scientists responses.

FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Intercrop; Maize; Faba bean; Forage quality; Residual soil nitrogen; Weed"	"NITROGEN TRANSFER; DAIRY-COWS; CORN; SILAGE; MATURITY; PROTEIN; CROPS"	This study investigated the effects of intercropping organically grown maize and faba bean under Swedish conditions on yield, forage quality, soil mineral nitrogen (N) content after harvest and weed incidence. Experiments with maize and faba bean as a monocrop and intercrop were performed at three field sites, with various amounts of N (dairy slurry) applied. The land equivalent ratio (LER) was 1.10-1.21 in two of the three experiments. The mean crude protein concentration of the three experiments increased from 63 g kg(-1), in feed of monocropped maize, to 107 g kg(-1), in feed of maize intercropped with faba bean. Intercropping had lower N balances compared with monocropped maize and tended to reduce the content of mineral N in the soil after harvest by, on average, 10 kg ha(-1). Weed incidence was slightly reduced by intercropping compared with monocropped maize. In conclusion, the results show that intercropping maize and faba bean in organic production can generate positive yield effects with LER > 1. Furthermore, intercropping resulted in higher protein content and lower residual soil mineral N after harvest compared to monocropped maize. Intercropping can thus increase the sustainability of forage production by reducing the need for protein feed and the risk of N pollution. The positive effects of intercropping, i.e. increased yield and reduced soil residual N, were found in the fields with relatively high amount of available N, but not in a field with lower N availability.

China has a vast territory with complex ecological conditions. Rotation, intercropping, and mixed cropping involving pulses are normal cropping systems in China. Whether indigenous or introduced crops, pulses have played an important role in Chinese cropping systems and made an important contribution to food resources for humans since ancient times. The six major food legume species (pea, faba bean, common bean, mung bean, adzuki bean, and cowpea) are the most well-known pulses in China, as well as those with more local distributions; runner bean, lima bean, chickpea, lentil, grass pea, lupine, rice bean, black gram, hyacinth bean, pigeon pea, velvet bean, winged bean, guar bean, sword bean, and jack bean. China has remained the world's leading producer of peas, faba beans, mung beans, and adzuki beans in recent decades, as documented by FAO statistics and China Agriculture Statistical Reports. The demand for food legumes as a healthy food will markedly increase with the improvement of living standards in China. Since China officially joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, imports of pea from Canada and Australia have rapidly increased, resulting in reduced prices for dry pea and other food legumes. With reduced profits for food legume crops, their sowing area and total production has decreased within China. At the same time, the rising consumer demand for vegetable food legumes as a healthy food has led to attractive market prices and sharp production increases in China. Vegetable food legumes have reduced growing duration and enable flexibility in cropping systems. In the future, production of dry food legumes will range from stable to slowly decreasing, while production of vegetable food legumes will continue to increase.

This paper examines determinants of households' maize stover use as livestock feed, fuel and soil amendment in maize-based systems in Ethiopia. In these systems maize stover is primarily used as feed (56% of biomass) and fuel (31%), with the feed use share negatively associated with maize production potential. We develop a Seemingly Unrelated Regression model to capture the interdependence of crop residue uses. Results show extension training on crop residue retention in the field results in more residue use for soil amendment and less for feed. Farmers with more livestock tend to use more residues for feed and less for soil mulch. Cropping pattern, farm size, agro-ecology and crop residue production also influence crop residue utilization. Conservation agriculture interventions have implications for crop residue use and need to consider access to information, cropping patterns, resources endowments and other socio-economic factors in their development and targeting.

Effect of age (1-4-year-old) and management (slurry, grazing multispecies mixture) of a grass phase mixed crop rotation on carbon sequestration and emissions upon cultivation was compared with 17-year-old grassland and a pea field as reference. Aboveground and root biomass were determined and soils were incubated to study CO2 emissions after soil disturbance. Aboveground biomass was highest in 1-year-old grassland with slurry application and lowest in 4-year-old grassland without slurry application. Root biomass was highest in 4-year-old grassland, but all 1-4-year-old grasslands were in between the pea field (0.81 +/- 0.094 g kg(-1) soil) and the 17-year-old grassland (3.17 +/- 0.22 g kg(-1) soil). Grazed grasslands had significantly higher root biomass than cut grasslands. There was no significant difference in the CO2 emissions within 1-4-year-old grasslands. Only the 17-year-old grassland showed markedly higher CO2 emissions (4.9 +/- 1.1 g CO2 kg(-1) soil). Differences in aboveground and root biomass did not affect CO2 emissions, and slurry application did not either. The substantial increase in root biomass with age but indifference in CO2 emissions across the age and management in temporary grasslands, thus, indicates potential for long-term sequestration of soil (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of cover crop rotations to enhance productivity and diminished chemical fertilizer application. The experiment was conducted as split plot based on a randomized complete blocks design with four replications in north of Iran, during 2015-16 and 2016-17. Six cover crop rotations including perko-rice, buko-rice, mixed cropping of clover + ramtil + phaselia-rice, clover-rice, faba bean-rice, and fallow-rice were used as main plots. Four levels of nitrogen fertilizer application included 0, 50, 100, and 150 kg.ha(-1) of urea source as sub plots. The findings revealed that the maximum lodging index was achieved for perko-rice with 150 kg urea.ha(-1). Regarding the findings of yield components, the highest paddy yield (5147 kg.ha(-1)) was achieved in perko-rice rotation with 100 kg urea ha(-1). In all crop rotations, perko-rice rotation presenting the maximum N use efficiency, N utilization efficiency, and N uptake efficiency was obtained with 100 kg urea ha(-1). Totally, it was observed that the positive effects of the cover crops in the second year was were more pronounced, where perko was more suitable than other cover crops. These findings suggest that long-term cover of these crops especially perko and buko can improve soil properties and encourage proper plant growth in paddy fields rotation, which in the long term is useful for crop production and improving qualitative parameters.

The adoption of aerobic rice system (ARS), an alternative to the conventional systems, could considerably increase resource-use efficiencies. Information on farmer perceptions is vital to identify socio-technological factors of adoption. Our aim was to understand and analyse farmer perceptions about ARS in regards to future adoption. We conducted our study in the Pakistani Punjab with three groups of farmers: (I) informant farmers in rice-wheat system who trialled ARS in a participatory research trial (n=70), (II) rice farmers in rice-wheat, mixed-cropping and cotton-wheat system with no experience of ARS (n=97), and (III) non-rice farmers in mixed-cropping and cotton-wheat system (n = 48). Data were collected using a pretested semi-structured questionnaire and analysed by using descriptive statistics and chi-square tests. More than half of respondents in groups II and III had never heard of ARS, though, 76% were open to experimenting. Across three groups, farmers perceived ARS as a means of increasing resource-use efficiency particularly for labour, net profitability, and an option for crop diversification in the mixed-cropping system. Perceived threats were weeds, diseases, poor germination, spikelet sterility, low yields, and frequent irrigation requirement. Deciding factors for repeat ARS plantings by group I were: ease of operation due to direct seeding, good income, and low input requirement. Deciding factors against repeat plantings were: unavailability of suitable fine grain basmati varieties, falling water table, weed problem, and unsuitable soil type. The results suggest that aerobic rice is an interesting alternative to traditional rice production as evident from the willingness to plant again by 73% group I demonstration households but the unavailability of well-adapted basmati varieties hampers its expansion. Farmers' appreciation of risks and benefits can pave the way for large-scale adoption. Associated risks can be reduced by filling the identified knowledge or technological gaps through additional research and farmer awareness programmes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

BOTRYTIS; ALLIUM-PORRUM L.; WHITE CABBAGE; SOWING DATE; SOIL; SYSTEMS; YIELD; FIELD; REDUCE; CROPS"	Intercropping can improve yield and nitrogen use efficiency in organic vegetable production by pairing crops with complementary resource use. An intercrop field experiment was conducted to determine yield, root growth and nitrogen (N) dynamics using faba bean (Vicia faba L.) grown as a vegetable and pointed cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata cv. conica). Both crops were grown in monocropping (MC) and intercropping systems (IC). Minirhizotrons were used to measure root growth. Yield of pointed cabbage per metre row was 28% higher under the IC system than under MC, whereas faba bean yield as fresh seeds did not differ. The land equivalent ratio was 1.06, showing that improved yield under IC resulted from efficient land resource use. Even though MC cabbage had the highest aboveground biomass, total N accumulation was higher under IC and MC faba bean systems. Both root frequency and intensity were greater under IC faba bean rows compared with MC faba bean because of the presence of cabbage roots in faba bean rows. Monocropped cabbage had the highest root intensity and the lowest amount of soil mineral N in the 0-1.5 m depth after harvest. Monocropped cabbage was efficient in assimilating N, whereas MC faba bean was efficient in exporting N as harvestable yield. The nitrogen use efficiency using the IC system (75%) was higher than growing faba bean (44%) and cabbage (65%) alone. Thus, faba bean as an intercrop in organic cabbage production systems improves land and N use efficiency by complementary root growth.

Integrating diverse forage sources reduces feed gaps on mixed crop-livestock farms	ANIMAL			English	Article						"energy; model; simulate; demand; supply"	"AUSTRALIAN GRAZING ENTERPRISES; DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEMS; PASTURE; PROFITABILITY; PRODUCTIVITY; MANAGEMENT; WHEAT; GRAIN; RISK; DSS"	Highly variable climates induce large variability in the supply of forage for livestock and so farmers must manage their livestock systems to reduce the risk of feed gaps (i.e. periods when livestock feed demand exceeds forage supply). However, mixed crop-livestock farmers can utilise a range of feed sources on their farms to help mitigate these risks. This paper reports on the development and application of a simple whole-farm feed-energy balance calculator which is used to evaluate the frequency and magnitude of feed gaps. The calculator matches long-term simulations of variation in forage and metabolisable energy supply from diverse sources against energy demand for different livestock enterprises. Scenarios of increasing the diversity of forage sources in livestock systems is investigated for six locations selected to span Australia's crop-livestock zone. We found that systems relying on only one feed source were prone to higher risk of feed gaps, and hence, would often have to reduce stocking rates to mitigate these risks or use supplementary feed. At all sites, by adding more feed sources to the farm feedbase the continuity of supply of both fresh and carry-over forage was improved, reducing the frequency and magnitude of feed deficits. However, there were diminishing returns from making the feedbase more complex, with combinations of two to three feed sources typically achieving the maximum benefits in terms of reducing the risk of feed gaps. Higher stocking rates could be maintained while limiting risk when combinations of other feed sources were introduced into the feedbase. For the same level of risk, a feedbase relying on a diversity of forage sources could support stocking rates 1.4 to 3 times higher than if they were using a single pasture source. This suggests that there is significant capacity to mitigate both risk of feed gaps at the same time as increasing safe' stocking rates through better integration of feed sources on mixed crop-livestock farms across diverse regions and climates.

Effect of Ridge Width and Cropping System on Productivity and Land Use Efficiency in Faba Bean-Flax Intercrops	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"Intercropping; Faba bean; Flax; Orobanche crenata; Fatty acids; Competitive relationships; Net return"	"FATTY-ACID-COMPOSITION; OROBANCHE-CRENATA; SOWING DATE; L.; TEMPERATURE; CROPS; TRAP; OIL; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; SUNFLOWER"	TWO FIELD experiments were conducted at the Agricultural Experimental Station, Faculty of Agriculture, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt during 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 seasons. The study to investigate the performance of two faba bean varieties, i.e. Giza- 843 and Giza- 2 when intercropped with flax to productivity, land use efficiency, famer's benefit and control broomrape in faba bean fields under two ridge widths. The experiment included 8 treatments which were the combination of two ridge widths (60 and 120 cm), two cropping systems (intercropping and solid planting) and two faba bean varieties (Giza- 2 and Giza- 843). The experimental design was a split- split plot design in randomized complete block arrangement with three replications. The results indicated that increasing ridge width from 60 to 120 cm decreased number of Orobanche crenata m(-2) but it increased seed yield of the intercrops plant(-1) and ha(-1) Intercropping flax with faba bean decreased number of Orobanche crenata -2 and seed yield plant(-1) and ha(-1) of both intercrop components. Faba bean cv. Giza- 843 recorded the lowest values of number of Orobanche crenata m(-2) and the highest values of yield and its attributes compared to Giza- 2 variety. Also, faba bean cv. Giza- 843 affected negatively seed yield of flax and its attributes. Most of the studied faba bean and flax traits were affected significantly by the interactions. The amount of fatty acids in flax seed was approximately 12.5 to 14.5% saturated (8.3 to 9.2% of palmitic acid and 4.2 to 5.3% of stearic acid) and 81.7 % to 85.2 % unsaturated fatty acids (20.9 to 22.3% of oleic acid, 13.0 to 14.2 % of omega 6 and 47.8 to 48.7% of omega 3). Total unsaturated fatty acids were not affected significantly by ridge width x cropping system x faba bean variety. Land equivalent ratio (LER) ranged from 1.63 for intercropping flax with Giza- 2 variety in ridges 60 cm width to 1.86 for intercropping flax with Giza- 843 variety in ridges 120 cm width. Land equivalent coefficient (LEC) exceeded 0.25. The dominance analysis proved that faba bean and flax plants are dominant and dominated components, respectively. The results show that intercropping flax with faba bean variety Giza- 843 in ridges 120 cm width achieved US$ 608.0 ha(-1) compared to solid planting of faba bean variety Giza- 2 in ridges 60 cm width. Intercropping flax with faba bean variety Giza- 843 in ridges 120 cm width decreased number of Orobanche crenata m(-2) and achieved high yield, LER and net return without any negative effect on total unsaturated fatty acids of flax seed oil compared to the other treatments.

Forage Yield, Growth Rate, and Nitrogen Uptake of Faba Bean Intercrops with Wheat, Barley, and Rye in Three Seeding Ratios	CROP SCIENCE			English	Article							"LAND-USE EFFICIENCY; COMMON VETCH; SOLE CROPS; OAT-PEA; QUALITY; MIXTURES; COMPETITION; LEGUMES; MAIZE; FERTILIZERS"	Annual cool-season grain legumes like faba bean (Vicia faba L.) grown in mixtures with winter cereals such as wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), or rye (Secale cereale L.) may offer advantages over cereal-alone crops grown for forage production. A 2-yr field study was conducted to evaluate the effects of intercropping faba bean with each of the above cereals in three seeding ratios (i.e., 75:25, 50:50, and 75:25) on growth rate, plant height, chlorophyll content, forage yield, and N uptake. Growth rate of faba bean and cereals was lower in the mixtures than in the monocultures, especially in the faba bean-barley mixtures because of the strong competitive ability of barley. Chlorophyll content was lower in faba bean compared with the cereals, and there was no difference among seeding ratios. Plant height of faba bean was higher in the intercrops compared with its monocrop at 3 wk after tillering (WAT), whereas at 6 WAT, the trend was different since faba bean plants in the monocrop were higher than in the intercrops. Rye monocrop and rye faba bean intercrops provided the greatest forage yield. Although the three intercrops of faba bean with rye had lower crude protein (CP) content than the faba bean monocrop, they provided the highest CP yields per hectare because of their higher forage yield than the faba bean monocrop.

Land use pattern and sustainability of food crop production in the fadama of Southern Guinea Savanna of Nigeria	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						"Fadama; sustainability; mixed cropping; land use and management"	"PRESIDENTIAL-ADDRESS; FRAMEWORK"	An assessment of the sustainability of food crop production in the fadamas of Southern Guinea Savanna of Niger State, Nigeria was carried out within the framework of small-scale farming households utilizing fadama for the cultivation of food crops. The study determined profitability of food crop production in the fadama and identified the pattern of land use and management and its effects on sustainability of fadama. A two- stage simple random sampling technique was used to obtain 149 food crop farming households interviewed for the study. The data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics such as frequency distribution, mean, standard deviation, in addition estimates of crop diversification index (CDI), nutrient intake index (NII), Ruthberg index, farm budgeting model was made. A typical household hectared seventeen persons and planted an average of 3.44 ha scattered in three plots. The major enterprises were sole crop rice and maize - based mixtures in about 0.70 and 2.59 ha respectively. Estimated mean CDI was 0.651 implying stability of income and sustainability of mixed crop enterprises while mean NII was 1.89 showing that combined crops hectareve low tendency to deplete soil nutrient. The Ruthberg index value of 0.393 implied that a six years fallow period alone may not be adequate to restore natural fertility. The farm budget analysis showed thectaret the sampled fadama food crop farming household hectared positive net return for all enterprises. Maize/cowpea enterprise hectared the highest gross margin of N25, 663/ ha while leafy vegetables ( for example spinach) hectared the highest return on investment (2.39). The average return on investment for all the farms studied was 1.89. Mixed cropping the dominant cropping system generally adopted by the fadama farming households gave higher gross margin per hectare. The study concluded that production of food crop in the fadama of the Guinea Savanna of Niger State, Nigeria is sustainable. Mixed cropping, consolidation of household resources, increased use of animal traction and organic fertilizer as well as integrated pest management is recommended. In order for the foregoing to be effective, they must be accompanied by improved extension service delivery, aggressive adult education programme, regulated use of agro-chemical, improved access to credit and availability of subsidized inputs.

Radish, (R), safflower (SF), pearl-millet (PM), mustard (M), field peas ((FP), faba-bean (FB), common vetch (CV), and berseem clover (BC) and their blends as R-SF-PM-M, FP-FB-CV-BC, R-SF-PM-M-FP-FB-CV-BC, R-SF-M-FP-FB-CV-BC, and PM-FP-FB-CV-BC were planted in a pot culture. The mycorrhizal inoculum significantly influenced the cover crops growth and biomass production under sterilized soils than that of non-sterile soils. While the safflower produced the highest total biomass, the pearl millet and field peas produced the lowest total biomass. Generally, in sterile and mycorrhizal conditions plant grown better and have high total C fixation. Within non-sterile and mycorrhizal inoculation, Safflower (1383.1 g C m(-2)) and Berseem Clover (1235.5 g C m(-2)) as a single species have fixed highest amount of carbon as biomass. Mycorrhizae inoculated BC+CV+FB+FP+SF+PM blends had a return of 1365.0 g C m(-2) in non-sterile soil. Our results suggested that cover crops in single or mixed stands with mycorrhizal inoculations are expected to provide a significantly greater amount of biomass, which would contribute to soil organic matter and nutrient recycling for crop production.

AimTo study the mechanism by which cinnamic acid promotes faba bean wilt and the mechanism by which intercropping alleviates this effect. MethodsHydroponics was used to study the effects of inoculation with or without Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. fabae (FOF) and the effect of addition of different concentrations of cinnamic acid on seedling growth, Fusarium wilt, stem cell wall degrading enzyme activity, lignin content, tissue structure of the stem and leaf photosynthesis in monocropping and intercropping systems following the inoculation of faba bean with FOF. ResultsTreatment with FOF significantly reduced the biomass and leaf photosynthesis of faba bean compared with the control. Microscopic observation showed that the xylem vessels of the stem were slightly thickened. Compared with FOF alone, the combination of FOF and cinnamic acid stress significantly increased the activity of cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) produced by FOF in the stem and content of lignin in the stem. Microstructural observation showed that cell wall thickening of the xylem conduit, stratification, formation of a cavity and even caused the dispersion of tissue cell structure in the stem tissue of faba bean. Furthermore, the biomass and leaf photosynthesis of faba bean decreased significantly, and the occurrence of faba bean wilt increased. Compared with the faba bean monocropping treatment, the wheat and faba bean intercropping treatment significantly reduced the activity of CWDEs of FOF produced in faba bean stems and increased the lignin content. In addition, observation of the microstructure indicated that the tissue structural cell wall thickened after the stem had decreased, and the amount of colloidal substances and their containment decreased, causing a further decrease in tissue deformation, smaller intercellular spaces, less divided layer cell damage, an increase in the aboveground biomass and leaf photosynthesis of faba bean and a decrease in the occurrence of faba bean wilt. ConclusionCinnamic acid decreased the resistance of tissue structure and promoted the occurrence of wilt. Wheat and faba bean intercropping improved the resistance of tissue structure, which reduced the occurrence of wilt.

We compared the relative susceptibility to management of microbial community metabolism with a number of soil organic matter (OM) and microbial parameters currently used as indicators of changes in soil biological quality. Following long-term cereal cropping, plots were subjected to a 16-month treatment period consisting of either a mixed cropping sequence of vetch, spring barley and clover or a continuous grass-clover ley which was periodically mown and mulched. The treatments had no effect on soil biomass N or respiration of microbial populations inoculated into Biolog Gram negative (GN) plates. After 16 months there were no management-induded changes to total OM, light-fraction OM C and N, labile organic N or water-soluble carbohydrates. However, patterns of substrate utilization by the soil microbial population following inoculation into Biolog GN plates were found to be highly sensitive to management practice. In the mixed cropping sequence, substrate utilization changed markedly following plough-in of the vetch crop, with a smaller change occurring after harvesting of the barley. In the ley treatment, substrate utilization was not affected until the onset of mowing, when the pattern changed to become similar to that in the mixed cropping sequence. Metabolic diversity of the Biolog-culturable microbial population was increased by the ley treatment, but was not affected by the cropping sequence. We conclude that patterns of microbial substrate utilization and metabolic diversity are more sensitive to the effects of management than are OM and biomass pools, and therefore have value as early indicators of the impacts of management on soil biological properties, and hence soil quality.

We designed a greenhouse experiment to understand how common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs) regulate intra- and inter-specific plant-plant interactions in intercropping systems, utilizing microcosms divided into one inner and four outer compartments. The inner compartment was separated from the outer compartments by a 0.45 mu m mesh (+Soil water and nutrients-CMNs-Roots), a 30 mu m mesh (+Soil water and nutrients+CMNs-Roots), a solid barrier (-Soil water and nutrients-CMNs-Roots), and no barrier (+Soil water and nutrients+CMNs+Roots). Both faba bean (Vicia faba L.) and coix (Coix lachryrma-jobi L.) were grown as the donor plants in the inner compartment. The plant combinations were donor coix-receiver coix, donor coix-receiver faba bean, donor faba bean-receiver faba bean, and donor faba bean-receiver coix. The inner compartment was inoculated with Flomus intraradices, or Funneliformis mosseae, or remained noninoculated in soil with low P content (< 5 g/kg soil). Our study found that there were clear advantages of interspecific interaction (coix/faba bean combination) over intraspecific (coix/coix and faba bean/faba bean combinations) in the both presence and absence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF). The establishment of CMNs appears to promote intra- and inter-specific interactions between donor and receiver plants, and exhibits strong positive effects on plant growth and P uptake. The contribution to plant growth and P uptake of CMNs formed by F. mosseae was greater than by F. intraradices.

We have developed a technique called close mixed-planting using flood-adapted rice (Oryza sativa L.) and upland crops with tangled root systems, showing that this technique can mitigate the damage caused to upland crops by flooding. However, the plant response during the reproductive stage has not yet been examined. In this study, we estimated the alleviative effects of close mixed-planting on the growth inhibition and physiological damage to pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) caused by flooding at the reproductive stage in northern Namibia. Pearl millet and NERICA4 (Oryza spp., interspecies of O. sativa and O. glaberrima) were used. Four-week-old single- and mixed-crop pearl millets were transplanted and grown for 22 days, and then flooding treatment was administered for 28 days. The growth and physiological parameters of single pearl millet were significantly decreased by flooding stress, and the parameters did not recover during a 14-day recovery period compared with those of unflooded single and mix-cropped pearl millet. On the other hand, the damage to mix-cropped pearl millet by flooding was suppressed. Thus, the mixed-cropping mitigated the anoxic stress of pearl millet caused by flooding at the reproductive stage and contributed to the improved growth after the recovery period. This result suggested that the close mixed-planting with rice can contribute to the mitigation of flooding damage not only at the vegetative stage but also at the reproductive stage of pearl millet in the semi-arid African country, Namibia.

Technologies that combine these components can play an even greater pro-ecological role in modern agriculture. The claim is made that row intercropping of spring barley and peas, along with strip tillage, is an alternative to traditional methods of sowing cereals and legumes. This hypothesis was verified in a three-year field experiment in which row intercropping of barley and peas (alternating every row) was compared with traditional mixed-crop, within-row cropping (plants of each species in each row) and pure sowing of each species. Row intercropping of barley and peas using strip-till, one-pass technology, as compared with mixed-crop, within-row, improved the uniformity of plant emergence and plant density of peas before harvesting and reduced weed infestation. The productivity of barley and peas was higher than with pure sowing by 8.5% and 10.2%, respectively, and the productivity of peas was also higher by 38.9% than when sowing in mixed-crop, within-row. The yield of barley grain/seeds and peas under row-intercropping was 1.75 t ha(-1) higher than the yield of pea seeds with pure sowing, and 0.79 t ha(-1) lower than the yield of barley in pure sowing. On the other hand, the yield of grain/seed protein under this mixture was similar to the pea protein yield with pure sowing and 109 kg ha(-1) higher than the barley protein yield with pure sowing. The positive results should inspire further research to obtain a better understanding of the conditions and effects of growing grains with legumes with strip-till one-pass technology.

In both years, intercropping increased crop yield, changed N and P availability, and affected the microbiological properties in rhizosphere of the three species compared to sole cropping. Generally, intercropping increased microbial biomass C, N, and P availability, whereas it reduced microbial biomass N in rhizosphere of wheat. The rhizosphere bacterial community composition was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rRNA. In the third year of different cropping systems, intercropping significantly changed bacterial community composition in rhizosphere compared with sole cropping, and the effects were most pronounced in the wheat/faba bean intercropping system. The effects were less pronounced in the second year. The results show that intercropping has significant effects on microbiological and chemical properties in the rhizosphere, which may contribute to the yield enhancement by intercropping.

Although the push-pull strategy based on intercropping has been reported to effectively prevent damage caused to maize, the potential of wheat-based intercropping systems for S. frugiperda management has rarely been assessed. In this study, the offspring performance, oviposition, and feeding preferences of S. frugiperda on four commonly planted crops-maize, pea (Pisum sativum), faba bean (Vicia faba), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa)-in wheat-based intercropping system were investigated to evaluate the roles of those host plants in the pest management. The results showed that S. frugiperda larvae performed poorly on pea and faba bean plants, as indicated by the longest duration for larval developmental, total pre-oviposition period, and mean generation time as well as the lowest pupal weight and larval survival rate. Lower offspring performance on pea and faba bean leaves coincided with lower efficiency of larval consumption. Preference tests revealed that female adults and larvae exhibited a stronger oviposition on, and feeding preference for maize than wheat, whereas no-preference was observed for faba bean plants. This study revealed the adaptability of S. frugiperda and its preference for wheat and its four common intercropped host plants and provided an insight into the management of S. frugiperda through the establishment of a push-pull strategy in wheat-based intercropping systems.

This paper focuses on farming systems in the semi-arid areas of Zimbabwe, where biomass production is limited and farmers integrate crop and livestock activities. Conservation Agriculture (CA) is promoted to intensify crop production, emphasizing the retention of surface mulch with crop residues (CR). This paper quantifies the associated potential economic tradeoffs and profitability of using residues for soil amendment or as livestock feed, and explores alternative biomass production options. We draw on household surveys, stakeholder feedback, crop, livestock and economic modeling tools. We use the Trade-Off Analysis Model for Multi Dimensional Impact Assessment (TOA-MD) to compare different CR use scenarios at community level and for different farm types: particularly the current base system (cattle grazing of maize residues) and sustainable intensification alternatives based on a CA option (mulching using maize residues inorganic fertilizer) and a maize mucuna (Mucuna pruriens) rotation. Our results indicate that a maize mucuna rotation can reduce trade-offs between CR uses for feed and mulch, providing locally available organic soil enhancement, supplementary feed and a potential source of income. Conservation Agriculture without fertilizer application and at non-subsidized fertilizer prices is not financially viable; whereas with subsidized fertilizer it can benefit half the farm population. The poverty effects of all considered alternative biomass options are however limited; they do not raise income sufficiently to lift farmers out of poverty. Further research is needed to establish the competitiveness of alternative biomass enhancing technologies and the socio-economic processes that can facilitate sustainable intensification of mixed crop-livestock systems, particularly in semi-arid environments.

This avoids risk of complete crop failure and may returns higher income. The study aimed to investigate appropriate seed-rates combination for wheat-Brassica as mixed- or intercropped in rainfed conditions. Experiments were conducted at National Agricultural Research Center (NARC), Islamabad Pakistan during winter 2004-05 and 2005-06 using 10 treatments for wheat and Brassica as sole and mixed- or intercropped with 100 and 5 kg ha(-1) for sole crop and 100 kg ha(-1) for wheat with 40, 50, 60, and 70% lower than the recommended for Brassica. Sowing was done in 3rd week of October each year, in lines spaced 30cm. Fertilizer was applied N 48, P2O5 34 and K2O 18 (kg ha(-1)). Brassica was manually removed for fodder at flowering. Seed rate (SR) significantly (p<0.05) affected wheat grain yield. Cropping system (CS) significantly (p<0.05) affected grain yield of Brassica. Interactions of CS and SR were also significant (p<0.05) for both species. Planned mean comparison for grain yield was found significant (p<0.05) for wheat and brassica. Grain yield for sole wheat was 4.28t ha-1 but reported higher in mixed than intercropped. Grain yield of wheat decreased with increase in seed rate of Brassica as intercropped. Higher grain yield (4.39 t ha(-1)) of wheat was recorded for seed rates combinations 100:50 (%) as wheat:Brassica intercropped. The land equivalent ratio (LER) for mixed or intercropped system was higher than the sole crop and it increased with increase in the seed rate of Brassica as mixed crop but decreased as intercropped. The high LER was associated to treatment 100:50 (%) seed rates combination for wheat:Brassica as intercropped. Intercropped resulted the greater LER (1.78) than the mixed crop (1.66) and was found most effective for sustainable production in the rainfed areas for a higher net return.

Non-nitrogen precrop effects entail potential benefits via increased availability of soil phosphorus to the subsequent crops. Faba bean acts as a break crop in intensive cereal-dominated crop rotations. Faba bean enables diversification of the agroecosystem, i.e. planned biodiversity in time via diversified crop rotations and in space via intercrops, indirectly enhancing associated diversity of wild flora, wild fauna and soil microbes that may affect the sustainability of agricultural systems. Nevertheless, most effects are indirect effects on soil fertility, productivity, and system stability, as well as resilience of the entire agroecosystems, effects that can seldom be attributed solely to this crop. The environmental impacts of grain legumes have been studied at different levels by means of life cycle assessment (LCA). Considering the individual crops, it can be shown that faba bean enables savings of energy and reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, but it is difficult to assess all precrop effects at the individual crop level. First, comparisons of whole crop rotations with and without grain legumes show reductions of energy consumption, global warming, ozone formation, and acidification and ecotoxicity in intensive cereal-rich crop rotations. Eutrophication was at a similar level, with a tendency for increased nitrate leaching and a decrease of other N emissions. Replacement of imported soybean meal by locally produced pulses could have a favourable effect, particularly for pulses produced and used on-farm. However, depending on the raw materials used to replace soybean meal, the effects can also be unfavourable. Finally, shifting the human diet toward less reliance on meat has the potential to reduce environmental burdens, but care must be taken that the plant products are not too highly processed.

However, knowledge of lentil cultivation was almost lost, and today's yields are still low. To gain an overview of current farm practices and of factors that can help lentil cultivation thrive, 25 lentil farmers (21 organic, 4 conventional) from SW Germany answered questionnaires for agronomic data on lentil cultivation in the years 2015, 2016, and 2017. Eleven farmers took part in additional semi-structured interviews about their motivation and the most important factors (economic, ecological, and social) that encouraged them to grow lentils. Neither the lentil variety (Anicia, Spath's Alblinse I and II), nor the companion crop for the usual mixed cropping (spring barley, oat, and camelina), significantly influenced lentil yield. If lentil cultivation is to further expand, data from more farmers could be evaluated and factors that contribute to crop thriving analyzed more clearly. The cultivation techniques currently practiced are diverse, and lentils integrate well into existing structures. Farmers appear motivated to grow lentils by good examples of colleagues, by availability of marketing channels, and by the desire to promote lentils' ecological and social benefits.

Asymmetrical interspecific competition was noted during generative growth stages. The greatest competitive strength was observed for triticale in the mixture with wheat during the heading stage. In the two-species mixtures with equal proportions (50:50), triticale produced greater biomass. In the three-species mixture, the productivity of rye and triticale depended mainly on their initial high share in the crop (50%). Wheat, despite having a high share in the mixture, did not display high productivity, because the yield per spike and harvest index decreased. Rye in the mixed cropping with wheat produced significantly higher spike weight and culm weight in comparison with sole cropping. Triticale, despite being strongly competitive in the canopy during the generative growth phase, attained high grain yield per spike. The low competition coefficients for triticale relative to rye suggest that these two species have a similar competitive pressure during the period of harvests. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Rhizosphere acidification of faba bean, soybean and maize	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	"Article; Proceedings Paper"	5th International Symposium on Ecosystem Behavior	JUN 25-30, 2006	Univ Calf Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA		Univ Calf Santa Cruz	"Intercropping; Zea mays L.; Proton efflux; Phosphorus; Rhizosphere acidification; Glycine max L.; Vicia faba L."	"INDUCED PH CHANGES; PHOSPHATE ROCK; INTERCROPPED MAIZE; PHOSPHORUS UPTAKE; DIFFERENT SOILS; MOBILIZATION; EXCRETION; ROOTS; SOLUBILIZATION; EXTRUSION"	Interspecific facilitation on phosphorus uptake was observed in faba bean/maize intercropping systems in previous studies. The mechanism behind this, however, remained unknown. Under nitrate supply, the difference in rhizosphere acidification potential was studied by directly measuring pH of the solution and by visualizing and quantifying proton efflux of roots between faba bean (Vicia faba L cv. Lincan No.5), soybean (Glycine max L cv. Zhonghuang No. 17) and maize (Zea mays L cv. Zhongdan No.2) in monoculture and intercrop, supplied without or with 0.2 mmol L-1 P as KH2PO4. The pH of the nutrient solution grown faba bean was lower than initial pH of 6.0 from day 1 to day 22 under P deficiency, whereas the pH of the solution with maize was declined from day 13 after treatment. Growing soybean increased solution pH irrespective of P supply. Under P deficiency, the proton efflux of faba bean both total (315.25 nmol h(-1) plant(-1)) and specific proton efflux (0.47 nmol h(-1) cm(-1)) was greater than that those of soybean (21.80 nmol h(-1) plant(-1) and 0.05 nmol h(-1) cm(-1), respectively). Faba bean had much more ability of rhizosphere acidification than soybean and maize. The result can explain partly why faba bean utilizes sparingly soluble P more effectively than soybean and maize do, and has an important implication in understanding the mechanism behind interspecific facilitation on P uptake by intercropped species.

Treatments were intercropped combinations of maize densities (6, 7 and 8 plant/m(2)) and faba bean densities (30, 40 and 50 plant/m(2)) and 6 sole-cropped treatments. Two species were intercropped as additive series. The biological and grain yields of maize and faba bean were significantly affected by maize and faba bean densities. Maximum land equivalent ratio (1.97) was attained by 6 maize plants/m(2) with 40 and 50 plants/m(2) of faba bean intercropping combinations indicating that the area on which monocultures were planted would need to be 97% greater than the area allotted to the intercrop for the two produced the same combined grain yield. The highest standard land equivalent ratio (LERs) produced by intercropping of 8 maize plants with 50 faba bean plants/m2. Maximum RVT (1.31) was obtained in maize and faba bean intercropping with 8 maize and 50 faba bean plants/m(2). Whereas, intercropping monetary advantage in comparison with mono cropping was 30%. The combination of 8 maize and 50 faba bean plants/m(2) showed the highest profitability and could be introduced as best intercropping system.	"[Rezaei-Chianeh, Esmaeil; Nassab, A.

The vulnerability of a given system corresponds to its susceptibility to be harmed, reflecting its inability to cope with adverse effects. This paper presents a framework that can be applied to determine the economic vulnerability of farming systems considering their social dimension, and to identify farming management profiles that are likely to be less vulnerable. The framework defines vulnerability levels based on analysis of four quantitative indicators reflecting the 'behaviour' of the economic results per labour unit in the long term: the relative standard deviation of the economic result per worker, the relative mean distance of the economic result to a minimum threshold, the number of economic disruptions over a specified period, and the economic recovery time after disruption. The framework was applied to a sample of 208 French farms, and the results revealed that diversification alone is not enough to cope with risks. Less vulnerable mixed crop-livestock systems are characterized by more crop-livestock interactions, allowing for less dependency on markets and more flexibility. This kind of management allows farms to be larger and to have more livestock. These findings help clarify the vulnerability of farming systems and may encourage the development of policies to enhance market opportunities at the regional level to foster diversification strategies and flexibility.

Increasing interspecific competition drastically reduced tuber yields of all cultivars; fewer tubers m(-2) were produced and no tolerant genotype was identified. Likewise the mean tuber weight declined linearly for two cultivars when competition became severe. Shoot development was less affected. Under intense competition the plant top was favoured in assimilate partitioning to the detriment of tuber formation. Overall reduction in assimilate production due to mixed cropping was the major cause of yield loss. Various intercropping combinations were found with the same productivity but distinct proportions of the component crops (sweet potato + maize). Land equivalent ratio (LER) exceeded sole crop productivity only for the combinations with the highest maize yields.

WALP. GENOTYPES; N-2 FIXATION; AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION; GRAIN LEGUMES; MAIZE; COWPEA; CARBON; YIELD; SOUTH"	This paper summarizes effects of forage-legume intercropping on grain and fodder yield, land equivalent ratio, residual soil fertility, disease and insect pest reduction in mixed crop-livestock systems in Africa. In particular, it discusses the potential benefit of forage-legume intercropping in improving productivity, resource use efficiency and resilience of the system under climate change. Research undertaken in Africa demonstrates that intercropping forage legumes with cereals improves land intensification due to improvement in overall yield and soil fertility, and reduced risk of crop failure owing to rainfall variability, diseases, weeds and pests. Forage from intercropped legumes improves the intake of dietary nitrogen, digestibility of poor-quality feed, animal performance and efficiency of roughage feed utilization by ruminants. The improvement in digestibility alone leads to 15-30% reduction in methane emission per unit of animal product. Additional role that legumes may play includes lowering erosion (20-30%), reducing nitrogen leaching and carbon losses, and promoting carbon sequestration. Nitrogen fixed by legumes was on average 45 kg N/ha, and this ranges between 4 and 217 kg N/ha for herbaceous legumes and 8 and 643 kg N/ha for fodder tree species. Despite the many benefits of forage-legume intercropping, the current adoption rate in sub-Saharan Africa is very low. Future research aimed at selection of compatible varieties, appropriate plant geometry and temporal arrangement of the various intercrops under different locations and management scenarios, and minimizing the confounding effects of water, soil, light, microclimate and seeds could enhance adoption of the technology in Africa.

The plants were grown to maturity alone and in a mixture and data on different plant parameters collected after 2, 3, and 4 (maturity) months of seed sowing. When grown in mixture, wheat had an inhibitory effect on root proliferation, total biomass and grain yield of chickpea; the value of different parameters in mixture being one third of that determined when chickpea was grown as a sole crop. This inhibition was also reflected in the number of nodules per plant and was assumed to result at least partially from physiological malfunctioning of roots as reflected by a drastic and significant decrease (p = 0.05) in tissue water concentration. The inhibition intensified with time and severity of damage to chickpea roots maximized at maturity as suggested by a sharp decrease in root/shoot ratio. Interestingly, the weight of individual nodules was significantly better when chickpea was grown in mixture. Contrary to chickpea, biomass yield of wheat increased by >100% due to the companion crop.

There were no differences in population density and activity of M. sjostedti on sole cowpea crop and mixed cowpea/maize crop during the colonisation phase (i.e. 10-30 days after emergence of the plants. However, subsequently M. sjostedti numbers were lower in the mixed than in the sole crop, suggesting that maize did not interfere with colonisation of cowpea crop by thrips. In a choice situation, higher numbers of M. sjostedti oriented towards, and settled on, sole cowpea plants than on those mixed with maize. Olfactory tests indicated that fewer thrips oriented towards a cowpea/maize mixed odour source. When equal numbers of thrips were introduced into the centre of sole- and mixed-cropped cowpea plots, the thrips became randomly distributed in each plot. Fewer thrips were recovered from the mixture than from the sole crop. It is concluded that, although non-host plant odours do not reduce thrips colonisation they interfere with host plant utilisation."

Two groups of maize (Zea mays L.) or faba bean (Vicia faba L.) plants (monocropping) or one group of plant of each species (intercropping) were grown between three 1-mm-thick soil layers; the central soil layer is referred to as inter-rhizosphere, and the two outer soil layers are designated sole-rhizosphere. Faba bean intercropped with maize had an 11% increase in shoot biomass and a 15% increase in P uptake compared with monocropped faba bean. The cropping pattern did not significantly influence maize growth. After 4 weeks of growth, faba bean significantly decreased soil pH in both the sole- and inter-rhizosphere in monocropping, but no effects were apparent for the intercropping rhizosphere. The major carboxylates in the rhizosphere of faba bean were malate (18-45nmolg(-1) soil) and maleate (1.2-2.4nmolg(-1) soil). Only trace amounts of carboxylates were measured in the rhizosphere of monocropped maize. However, intercropped maize had a high concentration of malate (similar to 11nmolg(-1) soil) in both sole- and inter-rhizosphere; the malate was likely exuded by faba bean and was then diffused to the sole-rhizosphere of intercropped maize. The amount of malate exuded by intercropped faba bean was 19% higher than with monocropped plants. The results indicate that diffusion of protons and carboxylates extended the interaction zone between maize and faba bean, and may have contributed to enhancements of P uptake in the intercropping system."

Disease suppressiveness of field soils was evaluated in bioassays for the soilborne pathogens Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lini, and Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici. For both cropping systems, mixed cropping did not enhance disease suppressivecantly more suppressive to E oxysporum f. sp. lini than soils cropped to Brussels sprouts or the mixture of Brussels sprouts and barley. Analyses of the diversity of the indigenous bacterial and fungal microflora by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of amplified 16S- and 18S-rDNA fragments, respectively, revealed, in most cases, no significant differences between mixed and mono-cropped soils. In conclusion, in this study, mixed cropping of soils with Brussels sprouts and barley or with triticale and white clover did not enhance microbial diversity or disease suppressiveness of soils to three different soilborne plant pathogens.

In this study, two planting patterns of faba bean monocropping and wheat/faba bean intercropping, together with two treatments for disease control and noncontrol, and four nitrogen application levels (N-0 [0 kg/ha], N-1 [45 kg/ha], N-2 [90 kg/ha], and N-3 [135 kg/ha]) were tested for 2 years in a continuous field experiment. The results revealed that nitrogen application increased the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) of faba bean rust from 41.9 to 47.3%, with the N-3 treatment resulting in the largest increase. Nitrogen application decreased the relative control efficacy of intercropping on faba bean rust. Compared with monocropping, N-0 to N-3 with intercropping significantly reduced AUDPC by 33.1% for the first year and 28.7% for the second year (P < 0.05). Nitrogen application aggravated the faba beans grain yield loss, while the loss of yield components increased in the first year and then declined as the nitrogen application increased; the yield losses of monocropping were higher than those of intercropping. The N-1 and N-2 application levels significantly increased the total effect (TE) of intercropping yield advantage by 34.3 and 32.9% in the 2 years, respectively. During the 2 years, the overall partial land equivalent ratio of faba bean was greater than 0.33. The average disease control effect (DCE)/TE of intercropping was 56.1 and 49.3% for the 2 years, respectively, indicating that intercropping increased yields and that the contribution of the DCE was close to or higher than that of the other intercropping effects. A regression analysis of the grain yield loss and the AUDPC showed that reducing the nitrogen fertilizer input (N-1) could effectively reduce the yield loss caused by rust and enhance the yield. Intercropping of faba bean combined with a suitable nitrogen application (45 kg/ha) is the best treatment to maximize yield by fully utilizing intercropping for managing faba bean rust."

In this study, two multi-year field experiments were implemented from 2014-2019 under identical conditions. Two factors in a randomized complete block design were adopted in both experiments. In field experiment 1, the two factors included three planting patterns (mono-cropped wheat (MW), mono-cropped faba bean (MF), and wheat and faba bean intercropping (W//F)) and four N application rates (N0, 0 kg N ha(-1); N1, 90 and 45 kg N ha(-1) for wheat and faba beans, respectively; N2, 180 and 90 kg N ha(-1) for wheat and faba beans, respectively; and N3, 270 and 135 kg N ha(-1) for wheat and faba beans, respectively). In field experiment 2, the two factors included three P application rates (P0, 0 kg P2O5 ha(-1); P1, 45 kg P2O5 ha(-1); and P2, 90 kg P2O5 ha(-1)) and the same three planting patterns (MW, MF, and W//F). The yield performances of inter- and mono-cropped wheat and faba beans under different N and P application rates were analyzed and the optimal N and P rates for intercropped wheat (IW) and MW were estimated. The results revealed that intercropping favored wheat yield and was adverse to faba bean yield. Wheat yield increased by 18-26%, but faba bean yield decreased by 5-21% in W//F compared to MW and MF, respectively. The stimulated IW yield drove the yield advantage in W//F with an average land equivalent ratio (LER) of 1.12. N and P fertilization benefited IW yield, but reduced intercropped faba bean (IF) yield. Nevertheless, the partial LER of wheat (pLER(wheat)) decreased with increasing N application rates, and the partial LER of faba bean (pLER(faba bean)) decreased with increasing P application rates. Thus, LER decreased as N input increased and tended to decline as P rates increased. IW maintained a similar yield as MW, even under reduced 40-50% N fertilizer and 30-40% P fertilizer conditions. The estimated optimum N application rates for IW and MW were 150 and 168 kg ha(-1), respectively, and 63 and 62 kg ha(-1) for P2O5, respectively. In conclusion, W//F exhibited yield advantages due to stimulated IW yield, but the intercropping yield benefit decreased as N and P inputs increased. Thus, it was concluded that modulated N and P rates could maximize the economic and ecological functions of intercropping. Based on the results, rates of 150 kg N ha(-1) and 60 kg P2O5 ha(-1) are recommended for IW production in southwestern China and places with similar conditions."

Evaluation of vegetable-faba bean (Vicia faba L.) intercropping under Latvian agro-ecological conditions	JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE			English	Article						"horticultural crops; legumes; dehydrogenase activity; hydrothermal coefficient; soil biological activity"	"LEGUMES; YIELD; WATER; SOIL"	BACKGROUND: Monoculture is used mostly in conventional agriculture, where a single crop is cultivated on the same land for a period of at least 12 months. In an organic and integrated growing approach, more attention is paid to plant-environment interactions and, as a result, diverse growing systems applying intercropping, catch crops, and green manure are being implemented. Thus, field experiments for evaluation of vegetable/faba bean full intercropping efficiency, in terms of vegetable and faba bean yield and protein content, were set up during two consecutive growing seasons (2014 and 2015). RESULTS: Data obtained showed that the most efficient intercropping variants were cabbage/faba bean (cabbage yield 1.27-2.91 kg m(-2), immature faba bean pods 0.20-0.43 kg m(-2)) and carrot/faba bean (carrot yield 1.67-2.28 kg m(-2), immature faba bean pods 0.10-0.52 kg m(-2)), whilst onion and faba bean intercrop is not recommended for vegetable growing since it induces a very low onion yield (0.66-1.09 kg m(-2)), although the highest immature faba bean pod yield was found in the onion/faba bean intercropping scheme (up to 0.56 kg m(-2)). CONCLUSION: Vegetable/faba bean intercropping can be used in practical horticulture for carrot and cabbage growing in order to ensure sustainable farming and environmentally friendly horticultural production.

In this study, effects of cattle manure on different cropping patterns, i.e., mono- and mixed-cropping of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) were compared across three cropping seasons at manure application rates of 0, 31 and 62 Mg ha(-1). The experimental plots were laid out in a randomized complete-block design with four replications. The parameters measured were growth and yield of the crops, soil organic carbon (SOC), total soil N, available soil P, and exchangeable soil K. The SOC was determined by the Black-Walkley protocol, total N by the modified Kjeldahl method, available P by the Olsen method, and exchangeable K by ammonium acetate extraction. Application of 31 Mg ha(-1) cattle manure increased SOC, total soil N, available P, and exchangeable K 1.3, 1.2, 1.2, and 1.4 times, respectively, over the control; the respective increase by the addition of 62 Mg ha(-1) was 1.7, 1.5, 1.3, and 2.1 times. However, differences between 31 and 62 Mg ha(-1) manure were not significant for SOC, total soil N, and available P, except for exchangeable K. Both grain yield and biomass yield of pearl millet increased with the application of 31 Mg ha(-1) manure, but declined with the application of 62 Mg ha(-1) manure, whereas grain yield and biomass yield of cowpea declined with the addition of 62 Mg ha(-1) manure.

Maize crop residues (stover) are an important by-product, primarily for feed use, often through in situ stubble grazing and/or as ex situ forage. This paper explores maize stover use along the agro-ecological gradient and the potential trade-offs, particularly the widespread use of maize stover as feed against its potential use as mulch (soil cover) to manage soil health within the context of conservation agriculture. The paper builds on three case study areas in Mexico in contrasting agro-ecologies: (semi-)arid, temperate highland and tropical sub-humid. Data were obtained through expert consultation and semi-structured farmer group/community surveys. Although in situ grazing is found in all three study sites, it represented the bulk of stover use in only one site (70% of stover in the sub-humid tropics), with ex situ feed dominating in the other two sites (>80%). Maize stover commercialization is limited and mainly restricted to households with no livestock and often within the local context. Farmers are generally hesitant to adopt conservation agricultural practices that require the retention of stover as mulch, as this competes with their livestock feed needs and purchased feed is expensive. To reduce trade-offs, a portfolio of options could be adapted to these mixed systems, including partial residue retention, cover and feed crops and sustainable intensification. Promising but yet to be explored, are investments in the genetic improvement of maize stover feed quality. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Measures to increase floral resources on arable land include agronomically non-productive approaches, like flowering fields (seed mixture of flowering forbs sown on fallows) and production-integrated approaches like organically farmed crops sustaining flowering arable wild plants. However, little is known about their relative efficacy for bumblebee conservation. We observed weight gain, foraging activity, worker body size, queen brood cell number and analysed stored pollen types of Bombus terrestris colonies experimentally sited adjacent to arable fields farmed under four crop-use types: (i) cereal mono-crops (winter wheat) under conventional farming, (ii) non-productive conventional flowering fields, (iii) organic cereal mono-crops (winter spelt) and (iv) organic legume mixed-crops (lentil mixed-crop). Additionally, we analysed the effects of flower cover in the surrounding landscape. Colonies located adjacent to organic winter spelt fields had higher foraging activity and larger body sizes, whereas other colony performance measures were unaffected by local crop-use type. Phacelia tanacetifolia, which was only cultivated in flowering fields, accounted for about 50% of the total pollen amount irrespective of crop-use type. This indicated a landscape-wide attraction for B. terrestris to flowering fields. Flower cover in the surrounding landscape did not affect colony development, but negatively affected pollen diversity. We conclude that although the pollen supply of flowering fields in the surrounding landscape strongly attracts bumblebees, local bumblebee populations could still benefit from less intensive farming practices increasing flowering wild plant diversity, such as with flower-rich organic winter cereals.

Two field experiments were conducted for evaluating three faba bean intercropping systems (FISs) with 100% sugar beet (S-Sole) as follows: 12.5% (FIS12.5%), 25% (FIS25%), and 37.5% (FIS37.5%) of faba bean in addition to the sole faba bean (F-Sole) and sugar beet (S-Sole) under foliar nutrients (FN) with boron (B), zinc (Zn), and magnesium (Mg) nutrients. The FIS x FN applications were evaluated based on the biological [growth, productivity, and cereal units (CUs)], competition [land equivalent ratio (LER), land equivalent coefficient (LEC), relative crowding coefficient (RCC), and aggressivity (A)] as well as economical [total revenue (TR), net profit (NP), and monetary advantage index (MAI)]. Although intercropping systems lowered crop yields as compared with solitary crops, the economic analysis of FISs showed that intercropping was beneficial, particularly the FIS12.5%, which resulted in higher TR, NP, MAI, and CUs as compared with their respective sole cultivation. Foliar application with B produced the best for the productivity, economic, and competition indices of both crops. The interaction application of FIS12.5% x B produced higher faba bean and sugar beet yields, improved LER and LEC values, and recorded higher TR, NP, MAI, and CUs. It can be recommended that the FIS12.5% integrated with B nutrient foliar application was more effective and could be considered a viable intensification strategy to increase intercropping yields, land use, and economic benefits.

BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS			English	Article						"Intercropping; Rhizobium; T-RFLP; ARDRA; Rhizosphere; Bacterial community"	"MICROBIAL BIOMASS; CROP YIELD; DIVERSITY; FIXATION; GROWTH; BIODIVERSITY; NODULATION; NITROGEN; SORGHUM; SOILS"	The effects of intercropping with maize and Rhizobium inoculation on the yield of faba bean and rhizosphere bacterial diversity were analyzed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, amplified 16S rDNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), and 16S rDNA sequencing. The results showed that intercropping but not Rhizobium inoculation significantly increased the faba bean yield. Probably the relatively high level of native rhizobia in soil annulled the effect of rhizobia inoculation. ARDRA results showed that intercropping did not affect bacterial diversity whereas Rhizobium inoculation decreased bacterial diversity. The canonical correspondence analysis showed that the composition of bacterial community was changed apparently by intercropping, and there was a positive correlation (P = 0.724) between faba bean yields and intercropping and an apparent correlation (P = 0.648) between intercropping and total N. The available content of K and P had a lower effect on the bacterial community composition than did the total N content, Rhizobium inoculation, and microbial biomass C. Rhizobium inoculation negatively correlated with microbial biomass C (P = -0.827). These results revealed a complex interaction among the intercropped crops, inoculation with rhizobia, and indigenous bacteria and implied that the increase of faba bean production in intercropping might be related to the modification of rhizosphere bacterial community.

Economic assessment of conservation agriculture options in mixed crop-livestock systems in Brazil using farm modelling	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						"Conservation agriculture; Cover crops; Crop-livestock systems; Smallholder farms; Linear programming models; Innovation adoption; Brazil"	"MAIZE; IMPACT; SUSTAINABILITY; PRODUCTIVITY; ADOPTION; AFRICA"	"Direct seeding mulch-based cropping (DMC) systems are often considered as an efficient way of combining ecological sustainability and economic viability while maintaining or increasing agricultural productivity. This paper describes a modelling analysis of the functioning of family farms in rural settlements of the agrarian reform in the Cerrados of Brazil. The aim was to assess the impact of the introduction of DMC systems with and without cover crops on crop-livestock management and net household income. A bio-economic farm model based on optimization of a utility function under multiple constraints was developed, capturing the interactions between livestock activities and the introduction of DMC systems. The model was run for six farms representing three farm types in the study area: 1) subsistence-oriented mixed crop-livestock farms; 2) market-oriented dairy farms; and 3) mixed crop-livestock farms, oriented to meat marketing. The following maize-based DMC systems were evaluated: a DMC system with mulch from residues of the previous maize crop and no cover crop, and two DMC systems with a fodder species, Brachiaria brizanta or Cajanus cajan, as cover crop. The simulated adoptability of DMC systems by farmers of the assentamentos depended to a large extent on the yields and feed quality of the fodder species. The modelling results suggested that DMC with C cajan as cover crop was the best suitable option for all simulated farm types. This was mainly explained by its high feed value (expressed in crude protein content). Furthermore, in the process of intensification and specialization in dairy production, farmers were likely to shift from using maize for pig husbandry to feeding it to the dairy cows. The introduction of cover crops in the farm systems was a source of additional animal feed during the dry season that was cheaper than the purchase of feed concentrates, when the size of the dairy herd did not exceed a certain threshold.

We used greenhouse, field and laboratory experiments to evaluate the role of organic acids in the occurrence of Fusarium wilt of faba bean to confirm the mechanism of rational application of nitrogen (N) and intercropping to alleviate Fusarium wilt. We investigated the response of organic acids exuded from the roots of faba bean to different N levels and cropping patterns (monocropping and intercropping with wheat). The results showed that the application of N and intercropping with wheat could control the Fusarium wilt of faba bean, which was closely related to the components and quantity of organic acids exuded from its roots. Among them, tartaric acid and malic acid are the most abundant and important, because they have a significant inhibitory effect on the growth and reproduction of FOF and substantially aid in the control of Fusarium wilt. The application of 90 kg ha(-1) of N combined with wheat intercropping significantly controlled the Fusarium wilt and increased the grain yield of faba bean. Our results suggest that 90 kg ha(-1) of N combined with intercropping is the most effective way to control Fusarium wilt and should be incorporated into agricultural management practices.

We aim to identify the combination of crop traits and management practices that confer a yield advantage in strip intercropping. Methods We developed a novel, parameter-sparse process-based crop growth model (Minimalist Mixture Model, M-3) that can simulate strip intercrops under well-watered but nitrogen limited growth conditions. It was calibrated and validated for spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) and spring faba bean (Vicia faba) grown as monocrops and intercrops, and used to identify the most suitable trait combinations in these intercrops via sensitivity analyses. Results The land equivalent ratio of intercrops was greater than one over a wide range of nitrogen fertilizer levels, but transgressive overyielding, with total yield in the intercrop greater than that of either sole crop, was only obtained at intermediate nitrogen applications. We ranked the local sensitivities of the individual yields of wheat and faba bean of the whole intercrop under various nitrogen input levels to various crop traits. Conclusions The total intercrop yield can be improved by selecting specific traits related to phenology of both species, as well as light use efficiency of faba bean and, under high nitrogen applications, of wheat. Changes in height-related crop traits affected individual yields of species in intercrops but not the total intercrop yield.	"[Berghuijs, H. N.

Although the application of both techniques provides a comprehensive understanding of model behaviour, they are seldom practised in combination. In this study, the Sobol global sensitivity method and the multiobjective algorithm AMALGAM are combined to assess the agro-hydrological SWAP model for simulating the soil water balance of different sole and mixed crops based on hydrological and phenological field observations. Fifteen unknown model parameters are subjected to the sensitivity analysis (GSA) with the aim of finding their importance to model performance of matric potential (F-1) and soil water content (F-2). Subsequently, sensitive parameters are calibrated by optimising F-1 and F-2 simultaneously. The GSA showed that the description of the rooting density and potential evapotranspiration is of crucial important to F-1, and that soil properties are most relevant for F-2. Parameter interactions played a primary role in the response of matric potential, being irrelevant for F-2. Structural model deficiencies in reproducing both objectives simultaneously were found in the multiobjective analysis, meaning that deterioration in the fit to one of the objectives is in favour of the other. However, solutions exist that produce satisfying fits to both observational types, suggesting that the SWAP model has the capability of simulating the soil water balance of the crops considered. The results of the evaluation period revealed model deficiencies in simulating the process under an environmental regime significantly different from that of the calibration period, indicating the necessity of acquiring a broader spectrum of environmental regimes for parameter calibration. Overall, this study demonstrates how complex and variable the relationship between parameters and model outputs can be in environmental models and highlights the value of combining global sensitivity analysis and multiobjective optimisation in order to improve model performances.

The impact of intercropping on nitrate accumulation in soil has been little studied in China. This field study integrated wheat. (Triticum aestivum)/maize (Zea mays) and maize/faba bean (Vicia faba) intercropping systems to assess effects of intercropping on nitrate accumulation in the profile of an alkaline soil under various application rates of N and P fertilizers in 2000. The study was conducted in Gansu Province, China. Grain yields of wheat were significantly enhanced by P fertilizer and intercropping. In the maize/faba bean system, grain yields of maize were enhanced by N fertilizer while those of maize intercropped with wheat were improved by both N and P fertilizers. Grain yields of faba bean were not affected by fertilization or cropping system. Nitrate accumulation in soil was positively related with application rates of N fertilizer. The amounts of NO3- present in soil after wheat harvest was greatest under wheat planted alone, followed by intercropped wheat, faba bean planted alone, intercropped faba bean, maize intercropped with faba bean, and least under maize intercropped with wheat. Amounts of NO3- in soil after maize harvest was in the order of wheat or faba bean planted alone, intercropping wheat and faba bean, maize intercropped with faba bean and wheat. The results suggest that intercropping decreases the accumulation of nitrate in the soil profile. The study also showed that combined application of organic materials and N fertilizer decreased nitrate accumulation compared with application of N fertilizer alone. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

(lupin) has a high tolerance for phosphorus deficient conditions as its roots can solubilize the unavailable phosphorus in the rhizosphere soil. The roots may also be able to solubilize other elements, but this requires further investigation. In this study, therefore, we conducted two experiments to comprehensively investigate the effects of lupin roots on the mineral dynamics of the rhizosphere soil. First, a mixed cropping experiment was conducted, in which lupin shared a rhizosphere with soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) in a long-term experimental field with four fertilizer treatments: complete fertilization (+NPK), without nitrogen (-N), without phosphorus (-P), and without potassium (-K). The results of shoot dry weight of plants cultivated alone indicated that lupin is highly tolerant to all N, P, and K deficiencies, while soybean can adapt to N deficiency with the help of rhizobia but is less tolerant to P and K deficiencies than lupin. When mixed-cropped with lupin, the concentrations of many elements in the soybean leaf increased, particularly with the -N and -P treatments. Furthermore, soybean growth was significantly improved when cropped with lupin in the -N and -P treatments. Second, a comparison of the elemental profiles of hydroponically and field-soil-grown plants was conducted. Under hydroponic conditions, the rhizosphere effect is negligible when the culture medium is well circulated. The lupin/soybean ratios for leaf mineral concentrations were considerably larger in the field cultivated plants when compared with the hydroponic cultivations for elements such as sodium, potassium, cesium, phosphorus, iron, copper, and molybdenum, as there were lower concentrations of these elements in the soybean leaves in the field. These results indicate that lupin roots can solubilize a variety of insoluble elements in the soil, which may be the reason why lupin can adapt to various nutrient deficient soils. In the lupin rhizosphere, the solubilization of cesium, which is generally strongly fixed by soil minerals and not easily leached, was particularly pronounced. This implies that the surface structure of clay minerals might be altered in the lupin rhizosphere, resulting in the fixed forms of various elements becoming available.

Rhizosphere interactions may play a significant role in the yield increases, particularly with respect to nutrient availability. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of intercropping on N availability and community composition of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in the rhizosphere of wheat, maize, and faba bean at different growth stages. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) based on 16S rRNA genes was used to analyze the community composition of bacterial ammonia oxidizers belonging to beta-proteobacteria. The results showed that intercropping with faba bean significantly increased nitrate concentrations in the rhizosphere of wheat and maize at the second sampling time (20 June) compared to monocropping or intercropping between maize and wheat. Intercropping significantly affected the community composition of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in the rhizosphere compared to monocropping, and the effects were most pronounced in the maize/faba bean and wheat/maize intercropping systems when faba bean and wheat were at anthesis and maize was in seedling stage. In wheat/faba bean intercropping, the effects of intercropping on community composition of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria were less pronounced at the seedling stage of the two species but were significant at anthesis.

The analysis highlighted potential of moderately coarse resolution WiFS data in discriminating the crops grown in fragmented conditions, provided detailed and adequate ground truth is used. The regression models using spectral parameters explained 94% variation in paddy yield. However, model using ground information as peak LAI in addition to spectral variables, could explain 91% variation in groundnut yield; thus for prediction of low-yielding and poorly managed crop a convergent model is essential.

Methods Maize and faba bean were grown in P-accumulated soil as either sole cropping or intercropping. After one year (Stage I) or four years (Stage II) of no P application, soil samples were collected respectively and analyzed for soil P pools using sequential fractionation. Aboveground biomass and P content were annually measured from 2013 to 2016 to assess the annual P balance. Results The intercropped maize/faba bean system showed a P-uptake advantage, with a Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) ranging from 1.2 to 1.5. The average shoot P content over the four years in intercropped maize and faba bean was significantly greater than that of the corresponding sole crops by 29% and 30%, respectively. Over the three-year P depletion period, the three cropping systems primarily depleted the 1 M HCl-P-i fraction, followed by sole maize, which depleted the NaOH-P-i and concentrated HCl-P-o fractions. Sole faba bean depleted the alkali-soluble P-o fraction (extracted by NaHCO3 and NaOH), and the intercropped maize/faba bean system depleted the conc. HCl-P-o fraction, which was similar to the effect of sole maize. Conclusions Both sole crops and intercrops mainly depleted 1 M HCl-P-i, but differed in P-o depletion. Sole maize and maize/faba bean intercropping depleted the sparingly labile P-o fraction, while sole faba bean depleted the labile and moderately labile P-o fractions.

Oilseed rape and intercrops were grown in boxes separated either with no barrier between the compartments or by a nylon mesh barrier (37 mu m) to license partial root interaction, or a solid barrier to stop any root interactions. Two intercropping systems (oilseed rape-faba bean and oilseed rape-ryegrass) were carried out in soil with Cd content of 5 mg/kg. The intermingling of roots between oilseed rape and faba bean enhanced the biomass of oilseed rape. However, the biomass was negatively affected implying the higher nutrient apportionment to the ryegrass than oilseed rape. Oilseed rape intercropping with both faba bean and ryegrass played a positive role in the shoot Cd concentration of oilseed rape. The intermingling of roots played a positive role in the citric and malic acids when intercropping with faba bean. A remarkable increase in water-soluble Cd and DTPA-Cd content was observed during oilseed rape-faba bean complete root interaction treatment, up to 175.00% and 46.65%, respectively, which compare with the monoculture treatment. In both systems, the translocation factor values were higher for oilseed rape (O-F system) than for the other test plants and were always >1. Thus the Cd removal potential of oilseed rape can be further improved in the future by optimizing agronomic practices and intercropping with faba bean.

The effectiveness of the adaptation options was evaluated using coupled crop and livestock biophysical models within an economic and environmental framework at both the enterprise and farm scales. The relative changes in economic return and environmental variables in 2030 are presented in comparison with a baseline period (1970-2010). The analysis was performed on representative farm systems across a rainfall transect. Under the impact of projected climate change, the economic returns of the current farms without adaptation declined by between 2 and 47%, with a few exceptions where profit increased by up to 4%. When the adaptations were applied for 2030, profit increased at the high rainfall site in the range between 78 and 81% through a 25% increase in the size of livestock enterprise and adjustment in sowing dates, but such profit increases were associated with 6-10% increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. At the medium rainfall site, a 100% increase in stocking rate resulted in 5% growth in profit but with a 61-71% increase in GHG emissions and the increased likelihood of soil degradation. At the relatively low rainfall site, a 75% increase in livestock when associated with changes in crop management resulted in greater profitability and a smaller risk of soil erosion. This research identified that a shift toward a greater livestock enterprises (stocking rate and pasture area) could be a profitable and low-risk approach and may have most relevance in years with extremely low rainfall. If transformative adaptations are adopted then there will be an increased requirement for an emissions control policy due to livestock GHG emissions, while there would be also need for soil conservation strategies to be implemented during dry periods. The adoption rate analysis with producers suggests there would be a greater adoption rate for less intensified adaptations even if they are transformative. Overall the current systems would be more resilient with the adaptations, but there may be challenges in terms of environmental sustainability and in particular with soil conservation.

We hypothesized that interspecific competition can be alleviated by increasing N application rate and yield advantage can be obtained in competitive systems. A field experiment was conducted in Wuwei, Gansu province in 2007 and 2008 to study intercropping of faba bean/maize, wheat/maize, barley/maize and the corresponding monocultures of faba bean (Vicia faba L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) with N application rates of 0, 75, 150, 225 and 300 kg N ha(-1). Total land equivalent ratios (TLER) were 1.22 for faba bean/maize, 1.16 for wheat/maize, and 1.13 for barley/maize intercropping over the 2-year study period. Maize was overyielding when intercropped with faba bean, but underyielding when intercropped with wheat or barley according to partial land equivalent ratios (PLER) based on grain yields of individual crops in intercropping and sole cropping. There was an interspecific facilitation between intercropped faba bean and maize, and interspecific competition between maize and either wheat or barley. The underyielding of maize was higher when intercropped with barley than with wheat. Fertilizer N alleviated competitive interactions in intercrops with adequate fertilizer N at 225 kg ha(-1). Yield advantage of intercropping can be acquired with adequate nitrogen supply, even in an intensive competitive system such as barley/maize intercropping. This is important when using intercropping to develop intensive farming systems with high inputs and high outputs.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							"GROWTH; PRODUCTIVITY; RHIZOSPHERE; DIVERSITY; FIXATION; BARLEY; YIELD"	Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/faba bean (Vicia faba L.) intercropping shows significant overyielding and high nitrogen (N)-use efficiency, but the dynamics of plant interactions have rarely been estimated. The objective of the present study was to investigate the temporal dynamics of competitive N acquisition between intercropped wheat and faba bean with the logistic model. Wheat and faba bean were grown together or alone with limited N supply in pots. Data of shoot and root biomass and N content measured from 14 samplings were fitted to logistic models to determine instantaneous rates of growth and N uptake. The superiority of instantaneous biomass production and N uptake shifted from faba bean to wheat with their growth. Moreover, the shift of superiority on N uptake occurred 7-12 days earlier than that of biomass production. Interspecific competition stimulated intercropped wheat to have a much earlier and stronger superiority on instantaneous N uptake compared with isolated wheat. The modeling methodology characterized the temporal dynamics of biomass production and N uptake of intercropped wheat and faba bean in different planting systems, which helps to understand the underlying process of plant interaction for intercropping plants.

Plants in intercrops grow differently from plants in single crops, due to interspecific plant interactions, but adaptive plant morphological responses to competition in mixed stands have not been studied in detail. Here the maize (Zea mays) response to mixed cultivation with wheat (Triticum aestivum) is described. Evidence is provided that early responses of maize to the modified light environment in mixed stands propagate throughout maize development, resulting in different phenotypes compared with pure stands. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), red:far-red ratio (R:FR), leaf development, and final organ sizes of maize grown in three cultivation systems were compared: pure maize, an intercrop with a small distance (25cm) between maize and wheat plants, and an intercop with a large distance (44cm) between the maize and the wheat. Compared with maize in pure stands, maize in the mixed stands had lower leaf and collar appearance rates, increased blade and sheath lengths at low ranks and smaller sizes at high ranks, increased blade elongation duration, and decreased R:FR and PAR at the plant base during early development. Effects were strongest in the treatment with a short distance between wheat and maize strips. The data suggest a feedback between leaf initiation and leaf emergence at the plant level and coordination between blade and sheath growth at the phytomer level. A conceptual model, based on coordination rules, is proposed to explain the development of the maize plant in pure and mixed stands.

Several methods have been used for controlling this parasite, but without much success. In this study, the effect of intercropping with fenugreek on O. foetida infestation and faba bean production was studied. Results showed a significant reduction in O. foetida infestation in the susceptible (Badi) and resistant (Najeh) faba bean cultivars when intercropped with fenugreek in field, pot and petri dish experiments. This reduction appeared to be related to reduced seed germination and low numbers of underground Orobanche attachments, which may have been as a result of allelochemicals released by fenugreek roots, though this was not confirmed in this study. Intercropping with fenugreek also resulted in a significant increase in the shoot dry weight and seed yield especially in the resistant cultivar Najeh. These results attest that intercropping with fenugreek can be used in an integrated strategy management to reduce broomrape infestation.

The aim of the study was to determine the abundance and species composition of weevil assemblages noted in the fields of narrow-leafed pure stands lupin and lupin intercropped with spring triticale. Weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in mixed crops were studied at Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences, Poland, in 2010-2012. The experiment was designed as a split-plot with four replicates for each mixture of plants. Lupin and triticale were sown at three different proportions. The abundance of adult weevils was recorded using pitfall traps. The feeding damage caused by adult beetles on lupin plants was monitored weekly. Weevils were more numerous in the pure stands of lupin than in those intercropped with triticale. Usually more species were found in the pure stands of lupin than in mixtures. In each year, the dominant species in all the three treatments was Charagrnus griseus. Sitona macularius and Ch. gressorius were also abundant. The seasonal fluctuations of the number of notches caused by weevils on the leaf margins were similar in all treatments, irrespective of the lupin seed ratio in the intercropping system.

Among the macronutrients, the relative efficiency of phosphorus fertilizer is very low in alkaline-calcareous soils under arid and semi-arid environments. Therefore, a field study was undertaken to quantify the interactive effects of wheat varieties and phosphorous fertilization on grain yield and solubility of phosphorous nutrient in the rhizosphere. The treatments consisted of (a) two wheat varieties (Sehr-2006, Shafaq-2006, mixed culture) and (b) three phosphorus levels (0, 45, 85 kg P2O5 per hectare) were arranged in randomized complete block design and replicated four times. The results showed that biological grain yield and 1000-grain weight of wheat increased by 8.7%, 14.46% and 8.48% under mixed culture of varieties sehr-2006 and shafaq-2006, respectively over the solely grown varieties. The application of phosphorus @ 85 kg P2O5 ha(-1) resulted in increased quantity of total biological yield, grain yield and 1000-grain weight compared to unfertilized crop. The uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus contents were substantially enhanced under mixed culture cropping pattern over sole wheat cultivars. The availability of phosphorus was increased by 19.70% under mixed cropping over sole culture. It is inferred from the study that mixed cropping produced synergetic effects on the availability of nutrients in the rhizosphere, and thereby resulted in the higher production of wheat crop.

There is evidence that adding clovers to a crop solubilizes soil Cd, increasing the bioavailability of Cd. This can lead to high plant Cd concentrations. This research aimed to test whether liming-induced increases in pH in mixed crops of clovers and ryegrasses reduced forage Cd concentrations. A greenhouse pot trial applied lime at three rates (0, 1, and 2% of soil dry weight) to eight different plant treatments-four as monocultures (perennial ryegrass [Lolium perenne L.], Italian ryegrass [L. multiflorum Lam.], white clover [Trifolium repens L.], and red clover [T. pratense L.]) and four as ryegrass-clover mixtures (two plant types in each treatment)-in soil (initial soil pH = 5.1, initial soil Cd concentration = 1.31 mg kg(-1)) with added Cd (CdSO4 similar to 1 mg kg(-1)). Adding lime increased soil pH in both mono- and mixed crops and, in most treatments, increased forage yields. However, the relationship between forage Cd and soil pH differed between plant treatments. In mono- and mixed crop treatments containing perennial ryegrass, adding lime increased the forage yield but did not increase the mass of Cd in the plants compared with the no-lime treatment. However, adding lime to treatments that included Italian ryegrass increased both the forage yield and the Cd compared with the no-lime treatment. The results show that a combination of certain plant species composition and lime rates can optimize forage yields without increasing forage Cd concentrations.

A three-year field experiment and one water culture experiment were conducted to compare the crop performance between single and close mixed-planting under short-term flood (or anoxia) stresses. The survival rates, photosynthetic rates, and biomass production were higher in the mixed soybean than in the single soybean plants.

Total lithium uptake (mg m-2) was higher for wheat than for barley, and higher for semi-leafless pea than for leafy peas. Growing cereals with peas reduced the total lithium uptake by peas, compared with pure stands, especially in alternate-row mixtures. Growing peas with cereals only reduced the total Li uptake by cereals when they were cross-drilled. The Li uptake by wheat, barley and peas generally decreased with soil depth in a similar manner; however, semi-leafless peas absorbed proportionately more Li from close to the soil surface than did leafy peas. Both pea cultivars absorbed more Li at 10-20 cm depth when grown in intimate mixtures with cereals, compared with less intimate mixtures or pure stands.

JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						"Intercropping; Essential oil; Peppermint; Menthol; Faba bean"	"ZEA-MAYS L.; ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; USE EFFICIENCY; BIOMASS YIELD; NITROGEN; SOIL; QUALITY; GROWTH; TEMPERATURE"	Intercropping systems play an important role in achieving higher production and increasing the sustainability of agricultural ecosystems. In order to evaluate the quantity and quality of peppermint essential oil and faba bean yield in intercropping systems, a two-year (2015-2016) field experiment was conducted in Iran. The study was performed with different treatments at two harvest times (July and October). The treatments were monoculture of peppermint, monoculture of faba bean, and different ratios of peppermint to faba bean (including 50:50, 34:66, 66:34, 40:60, 60:40, 25:75 and 75:25%). Results demonstrated that the highest peppermint biomass yield (average of two years) was obtained in peppermint monoculture and intercropping ratios of 66:34, 40:60, 60:40 and 75:25 in both harvests. However, the highest and the lowest essential oil content in both harvests were observed in 40:60 cropped pattern and peppermint monoculture, respectively. In addition, the first harvest (July) gave about 20% more essential oil content than the second one (October). The highest essential oil yield in both harvests, however, was observed in 40:60 and 60:40 intercropping patterns. Furthermore, the July harvest gave approximately 52% more essential oil yield than the October harvest. At July harvest, the menthol content was enhanced in ratios of 40:60, 34:66 and 60:40 (increase of 3.3%, 2.8% and 1.8%, respectively) compare to peppermint monoculture. In addition, all intercropping patterns in the October harvest showed a higher content of menthol than monoculture of peppermint. According to the obtained results, intercropping of peppermint with faba bean could improve the essential oil quality by increasing the content of menthol and decreasing the content of menthofuran and pulegone.

Faba bean production can be severely constrained in the area by rust incited by Uromyces viciae-fabae. Control with fungicides is possible, but there is a growing interest on alternative control methods, compatible with organic agriculture. Intercropping faba bean with cereals has been suggested as an alternative to maximize land use and increase crop resilience, with potential beneficial effects reducing weeds and diseases. In the present work, we studied the effect of intercropping faba bean with barley, triticale or wheat on faba bean rust development. Field studies performed over two consecutive seasons in two different countries showed that faba bean rust is significantly reduced when faba bean is intercropped with cereals confirming the value of faba bean-cereal intercropping for the management of faba bean rust. These results confirm that, under our conditions, intercropping faba bean with cereals (oat, barley, wheat or triticale) could usefully contribute to the management of faba bean rust.

The exploration of reasonable fertilization and planting patterns will help better control this disease. Four N levels (NO: 0 kg N ha(-1), N1: 45 kg N ha(-1), N2: 90 kg N ha(-1), and N3: 135 kg N ha(-1)) and two cropping patterns (faba bean monocropping, faba bean and wheat intercropping) were examined for their effects on faba bean chocolate spot disease in Kunming, Yunnan Province, China, from 2015 to 2017. Nitrogen application increased the incidence and disease index of faba bean chocolate spot disease using monocropping and intercropping. Compared with the NO level, the N1-N3 levels increased the incidence and disease index by 5.8%-42.0% and 3.8%-46.3%, respectively. Nitrogen application also reduced the temperature and increased the relative humidity of the canopy. Compared with monocropping, intercropping created a better ecological environment within the canopy by significantly increasing the temperature and reducing the relative humidity of the canopy. The incidence and incidence index of faba bean chocolate spot disease were significantly reduced, and the disease index decreased the most using the N2 level, which showed the best disease control effect. Compared with monocropping, the faba bean yield using intercropping increased by 21.6%-46.7%, and intercropping had a high land equivalent ratio (1.28-1.42). Considering the effects of faba bean disease control and increased yield, faba bean-wheat intercropping and a nitrogen application level of 90 kg N ha(-1) is a good method to control chocolate spot disease and increase the faba bean yield. This work will increase the understanding of the impact of biodiverse cultivation and fertilization on sustainable agriculture and provide information on food security.

A collaborative activity among researchers, extensionists and practitioners from UPLB, BSU, HARRDEC, ICRAF, DENR-CAR, DA-CHARM, and NCIP was carried out to document and understand the indigenous strategies of farming systems in Bayyo, Mt. Province. Participatory rural appraisal (PRA) activities including transect lines, resource mapping, key informant interviews, and mind mapping were conducted with selected participants from the community. Most households in Bayyo maintain three production systems: irrigated rice fields (payew), permanent swidden (katualle), and shifting Cultivation (uma) plots. All three production systems are essential for their Survival. Local people practice a variety of indigenous strategies to sustain productivity in these production systems. These include terracing, crop rotation, mixed cropping, soil fertility management, and the sweetpotato cropping system. Payew fields are flat terraces built along the mountainsides with terrace sides fortified with stone walls. The se fields are irrigated with water from neat-by spring water to grow paddy rice. Terracing is also practiced in the katualle to reduce the steepness of the slope of the fields and to reduce soil erosion. Different systems of crop rotation and mixed cropping of rice, sweet potato, and peanuts are practiced in the three production systems to sustain crop productivity. Soil fertility in the payew fields is maintained by the application of the indigenous species Tithonia diversifolia. Laying removed weeds around sweetpotato plants as mulch is the main soil fertility management and weed control in the katualle fields. Fallowing is an important component of the shifting cultivation cycle in the Lima fields. Sweet potato is the second staple food crop in Bayyo and farmers keep a collection of a diverse array of sweet potato varieties Suited to different growing conditions and with varying characteristics of growing season length, herbage yield, drought tolerance and tuber storage longevity. PRA results have shown that indigenous practices kept the upland farms in Bayyo sustainable through the years.

The hyperbolic yield-density model was applied to phytomass and seed yield. Predictions and parameters of the model were used to quantify intra- and inter-specific competition, and to evaluate yield potential of the mixtures. The model accounted for 93% and 85% of the variation in phytomass and in seed yield, respectively. In both species intraspecific competition was more severe than interspecific competition. Oats was relatively the stronger of the two competitors, e.g. substitution rates were 0.33 plants of oats for a plant of bean with respect to oat seed yield, and 0.72 plants of bean for a plant of oats with respect to bean seed yield. Oats bad a greater yield potential than bean. The mixture sown in densities of 400 oats/m2 and 40 beans/m2 out-yielded the most productive monoculture with respect to seed yield. Land equivalent ratios (LER) of this mixture, 1.05 for phytomass and 1.06 for seed yield, indicated yield advantage. The greatest LER obtained for seed yield was 1.10. The predicted yield curves demonstrated that the maximum (asymptotic) combined yields, 13 t/ha of phytomass and 6 t/ha of seeds might be obtained by planting bean and oats in 1:1 ratio. Land equivalent ratios of this mixture were 1.23 for phytomass and 1.31 for seed yield. Both the actual results and the model predictions suggest potential of intercropped oats and faba bean.

Various studies highlight the advantages of intercropping, including the improvement of plant growth, stabilization of yield and reduction of economic and environmental risks common in monoculture systems. The research was carried out over two cropping seasons with different N fertilisation levels to compare winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar 'Wafia' and faba bean (Vicia faba L.) cultivar 'Alfia' cultivated as sole crops or intercropped. The aim of the current study was to evaluate intercrop efficiency using indices such as the land equivalent ratio (LER) and the interspecific (IE) and intraspecific (IA) interaction indices, and to verify whether the wheat and faba bean intercropping improves grain yield, biochemical properties and macronutrient uptake of two cultivars in the systems with low levels of nitrogen (N) inputs. The research results showed that without N input the LER > 1 indicates the most efficient use of environmental resources by intercropping. Without fertilisation, in the 2nd experiment, the IE of soft wheat was equal to 1 indicating that the presence of legume in the intercropping did not affect wheat plant productivity compared to sole crops in half density. However, in the 1st experiment, the presence of the legume was associated with a greater facilitation effect on wheat intercrop (IE > 1) inducing an increase in yield compared to half density. For both experiments, IA of wheat was less than 1 revealing that the wheat yield in half density was higher than that in sole crops in full density. Eventually, the intercrops for both experiments without any N fertiliser increased the protein, sugar, chlorophyll content and nitrate reductase activity of both intercropped species compared to the untreated and treated sole crops. Likewise, the uptake of macronutrients P and K was increased in faba bean intercropped in the 1st and 2nd experiment, respectively, when these elements were less available in the soil. However, Ca content did not show any significant effect. This allows us to conclude that intercropping of soft wheat and faba bean is a relevant way to reduce chemical inputs.

Plants were inoculated with the nematode by applying a water suspension of 2000 (for crops) or 3000 (for weeds) juveniles around the seedling roots. Host suitability was assessed, relative to a susceptible tomato variety, on the basis of severity of galling, number of mature females per g of root and number of eggs per egg sac. With the exception of groundnut (Arachis hypogaea), all the legume crops tested were able to support nematode reproduction to some extent. Bambara (Voandzeia subterranea) was the most susceptible host. French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) was also susceptible, while chickpea (Cicer arietinum), cowpea (Vigna ungaiculata) and soya (Glycine max) were moderately good. Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) was a poor host. Several of the weed species were able to support the nematode and two of these, Ageratum conyzoides and Nicandra physaloides, could be considered to be good hosts.

In this field study, the effects of two wheat and pea associations (mixed cropping and strip cropping) on aphid populations were compared with pure stands of both crops by observations on tillers and plants. Pea was more susceptible to infestations than wheat. As expected, the density of aphid colonies was significantly higher in pure stands during the main occurrence periods, compared with associations. Additionally, flying beneficials, such as not only aphidophagous adult ladybirds but also parasitoid, hoverfly and lacewing species that feed on aphids at the larval stage, were monitored using yellow pan traps. At specific times of the sampling season, ladybirds and hoverflies were significantly more abundant in the pure stand of pea and wheat, respectively, compared with associations. Few parasitoids and lacewings were trapped. This study showed that increasing plant diversity within crops by associating cultivated species can reduce aphid infestations, since host plants are more difficult to locate. However, additional methods are needed to attract more efficiently adult beneficials into wheat and pea associations.

Aims We aimed to (1) investigate the effects of intercropping on yields and nutrient uptake of maize, and (2) determine the relative contributions of above- and belowground interspecific interactions (RCabove/below) to these effects. Methods We conducted a 2-year, small-scale field experiment with maize grown either in monocropping or intercropped with faba bean, soy, blue lupin, or white mustard as companion crop. We included a treatment in which interspecific root interactions were restricted due to barriers in the soil. Maize and companion crops were analyzed for yields, and maize additionally for nutrient uptake. Maize partial land equivalent ratios (pLER), partial nitrogen and phosphorus equivalent ratios (pNER, pPER), and RCabove/below were calculated. Results Intercropping resulted in a similar productivity of maize as in monocropping on an area basis. Maize pLER, pNER, and pPER were larger than 1.0 in several species combinations, indicating a positive effect of intercropping on maize yields and N and P uptake. Interspecific root interactions accounted for 62-85% of the maize yield increase in legume/maize intercropping, but for only 22% in mustard/maize intercropping. Conclusion Our results indicate that intercropping is beneficial for crop production since it increases maize yields and N and P uptake of maize plants, and it also provides yields of a companion crop. A substantial part of these positive effects can be attributed to interspecific root interactions.

We aimed to investigate the effect of the above growing system on total biomass production, grain yield and leaching of mineral nitrogen (N-min). Four variants of intercropping (0 kg N/ha; 112 kg N/ha; 112 kg N/ha + 1.25 L of humic acids/ha; 70 kg N + 0.65 L of humic acids/ha) and two variants of sole cropping (0 kg N/ha; 140 kg N/ha) were used. Research results showed a good potential for growing wheat in the mixed cropping system without any negative effect on grain and total biomass production. No significant differences were found between the variants where winter wheat was grown with white clover (70 and 112 kg N/ha), and variants with sole wheat (140 kg N/ha), in both years of the experiment. The loss of N-min from the soil was affected by the application of N fertilizer and mixed intercropping system. During the experiment, the loss of N-min was higher by 20% in the variant using the sole winter wheat (140 kg N/ha), than in the MC variants."

Plant growth, nodulation and efficiency in the use of rhizobial symbiosis (EURS) for the legume, nitrogen nutrition index (NNI) for the cereal, and N and C accumulation in the soil were evaluated. Shoot dry weight (SDW) and NNI were significantly higher for intercropped than for the sole cropped wheat whereas there was no significant difference on SDW between the intercropped and sole cropped faba beans. EURS was higher in intercropped than in sole cropped faba bean. Furthermore, by comparison with a weeded fallow, there was a significant increase in soil C and N content over the three-year period of intercropping and sole cropping within the biennial rotation. It is concluded that intercropping increases the N nutrition of wheat by increasing the availability of soil-N for wheat. This increase may be due to a lower interspecific competition between legume and wheat than intra-specific competition between wheat plants, thanks to the compensation that the legume can achieve by fixing the atmospheric nitrogen.

A greenhouse study was conducted with maize and faba bean monocultures or intercropping at low phosphorus (P) and high P levels with three different water availabilities, and inoculated with or without AMF species Funneliformis mosseae. At low P level, overyielding was mainly due to the increase of maize biomass promoted by AMF relative to faba bean. Whereas in high P soils, overyielding was observed at all treatments, regardless of AMF. Inoculation of AMF significantly improved maize rather than faba bean P uptake, water use efficiency and photosynthesis rate, in particular at the low P level. This study identified the context dependence of AMF in influencing overyielding in maize/faba bean intercropping and demonstrates the importance of AMF in sustainable agricultural production.

With high-density planting, interaction among individuals may impede or improve sustainable yield and resources use, the elucidation of its effects requires more study. A 2-year field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of interaction between two mixed maize cultivars on root properties, biomass distribution and water use. Root biomass and surface area decreased, concomitantly, root hydraulic conductivity was improved because root length density in the 0-30 cm soil layer increased in the mixed crop plots. Lower root to shoot ratios resulted from positive interaction of the two mixed maize cultivars. Consequently, mixed planting interaction increased the harvest index under high-planting density. Finally, grain yield increased by 2.6%-15.6% and water use efficiency by 4.7%-18.3% with a disproportionate trend in different mixed planting densities compared with that of solitary crops. Maize yield and water use efficiency were improved under the same-high mixed planting density because of the improvement of root properties and the optimization of biomass distribution, in semi-arid region of China.

Nodulation of groundnut, crude protein, cellulose and ear yield of maize were maximum in mixed crops at the 1:4 ratio. In contrast, intercropping maize and groundnut reduced dry matter and grain yields of both crops. The only exception was observed on nodule number and seed/pod yield ratio of groundnut, plant height, dry matter and grain yield of maize, where no differences were noted between monocropped and intercropped systems under farming conditions."

This aim did not generally contradict the aims of gaining high faba bean grain yields, high amounts of symbiotically fixed nitrogen and an increased precrop effect. As a function of poor rooting systems and poor soil-nitrate uptake faba bean pure stands left high amounts of nitrate in the soil before winter, which is suspected to be leached during winter. A more homogenous rooting-distribution via narrow faba bean row distances increased soil-nitrate uptake and slightly reduced residual-nitrate content before winter. Increasing crop rooting-density by intercropping with cereals or undersown non-legumes considerably reduced soil residual-nitrate content. Undersown brassicas like oil-radish or white mustard were more efficient than ryegrass and intercropping with cereals. Undersown crops showed no negative effect on faba bean grain yield and N-2-fixation. Intercropping with cereals considerably reduced faba grain yield and N-2-fixation. Underseed variety in faba beans and intercropping considerably affected precrop effects to the successive crop oats as a function of different amounts and temporary availability of nitrogen.

Mixtures of spring-barley/oats, winter barley/winter wheat and winter barley/wheat/oats were tested in field experiments between 1986 and 1990. Disease incidence of Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides, Fusarium spp. and Rhizoctonia cerealis was greatest on barley and wheat. Lesions caused by Fusarium spp. were prevalent on oats. Stem-rot symptoms were reduced by 50% in barley/oats and barley/wheat mixtures. The reduction was comparable to the effects obtained with fungicide applications. The effects of mixed cropping of barley, wheat and oats varied greatly and the results were dependent on mixture composition. Disease reductions in barley and oats grown in mixtures were greater than those in wheat. In general, higher proportions of oats in a mixture favoured plant health by decreasing the incidence of diseases caused by P. herpotrichoides and Fusarium spp. A change of pathogen dominance often occurred after the application of fungicides in pure stands. In mixtures, however, total disease pressure was the result of an interacting complex of different pathogens that was less influenced by fungicides. The field experiments demonstrated that the level of disease reductions varied between pathogens, year and mixture composition.

Intercropping of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with canola (Brassica napus L.) under different spatial arrangements was evaluated for their effects on weeds and interaction between the crops at the Agronomic Research Area, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan, during 2009-2010. The treatments included wheat (line sowing), canola (line sowing), wheat (broadcast method), one row of wheat + one row of canola (30 cm apart), two rows of wheat + two rows of canola (45 cm apart), four rows of wheat + four rows of canola (75 cm apart) and mixed cropping of wheat + canola (broadcast method). The results revealed that all intercropping treatments significantly affected weed density and dry weight over component sole crop of wheat. Mixed cropping of wheat + canola suppressed dry weight of Phalaris minor Retz., Chenopodium album L., Rumex dentatus L., and Coronopus didymus L. by 94, 77.2, 77.4, and 92%, respectively, over sole crop of wheat. The other intercropping treatments like one row of wheat + one row of canola, two rows of wheat + two rows of canola, and four rows of wheat + four rows of canola generally suppressed total dry weight of weeds by 81, 74, and 76%, respectively. Four rows of wheat + four rows of canola gave the highest land-equivalent ratios 1.37 and net benefit Rs 93 543 followed by two rows of wheat + two rows of canola. It is suggested that wheat-canola intercropping system in agro ecological conditions of Faisalabad could enhance land-equivalent ratio > 1 (over-yielding) by suppressing weeds.

Designing intercropping systems requires the integration of plant species trait selection with choice of crop configuration and management. Crop growth models can facilitate the understanding and prediction of the interactions between plant traits, crop configuration and management. However, currently no existing crop growth model has been calibrated and tested for cereal-legume intercrops throughout Europea. We calibrated the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) for pure cultures of wheat and faba bean using data from Dutch field trials, and determined the phenological parameters to simulate pure cultures and intercrops from seven field experiments across Europe. APSIM successfully reproduced aboveground dry matters and, for wheat only, grain yields in pure cultures. In intercrops, APSIM systematically overestimated the aboveground dry matter and grain yield of faba bean and underestimated those of wheat. APSIM was reasonably capable of simulating plant heights in pure cultures, but respectively overestimated and underestimated the height of faba bean and wheat in intercrops. In order to simulate wheat-faba bean intercrops better, APSIM should be improved regarding the calculation of biomass partitioning to grains in faba bean and of height growth in both species.

This study examined the rationale behind farmers' practices and explored options to further improve productivity. The study involved two experiments. The first compared the overall benefit from the traditional weed management regime against the frequent weeding recommendation. Sixty farmers participated, each preparing two plots. The plots were randomly assigned to either traditional (one late weeding) or improved (two early weeding) management. The second examined the suitability of intercropping faba bean with oat (Avena sativa L.). It involved a 5 x 3 factorial experiment, three management practices (traditional, improved, and faba bean oat intercropping) and five faba bean varieties repeated over 3 yr. In the first experiment the improved weed management increased grain yield (2.49 vs. 2.12 Mg ha(-1)) compared to the traditional. But the traditional management produced higher (P < .01) weed forage biomass (2.12 vs. 0.27 Mg ha(-1)) compared to the improved. The analysis showed the opportunity costs associated with the loss in weed forage biomass were not convincingly offset by the economic gains from increased grain yields. In the second experiment, grain yield was again highest for the improved weed management and lowest for the intercropping. Analysis of economic returns revealed that the intercropping management provides greater benefit over the traditional management practice. Farmers' decisions have a rational economic basis and building on the traditional practicewith improved forage intercropping would allow to further optimize productivity.

However, crop performance related to interaction between wheat and faba bean is unclear, and knowledge gap about the relationship among crop performance, N management, and specie-specie interaction still remains in intercropping. Two-year field experiments were implemented in 2014-2015 and 2015-2016, and two factors involving in planting patterns (wheat monocropped, faba bean monocropped, and wheat and faba bean intercropping) and N rates (N0, 0 kg N ha(-1) (the control); N1, 45 and 90 kg N ha(-1) for faba bean and wheat; N2, 90 and 180 kg N ha(-1) for faba bean and wheat; N3, 135 and 270 kg N ha(-1) for faba bean and wheat, repetitively) were studied in a randomized complete block design with three replicates. Growth parameters and species interaction indices for inter- and mono-cropped wheat and faba bean under different N rates were estimated and calculated during each growing season. The results showed that interspecies competition was dominant in intercropping during the time from sowing to 75 days after wheat and faba bean emergence which sometimes induced lower growth rate of intercropping faba bean (IB) relative to monocropped faba bean (MB) and resulted in poor intercropping biomass production. Intercropping wheat (IW) suffered less intraspecies competition as compared to monocropping wheat (MW) during mid- and late-growth stages. The maximum growth rate (R-max), maximum biomass production (A), and grain yield of wheat were increased by 19.4-27.8%, 6.7-7.1%, and 19.5-28.2%, respectively, when wheat was intercropped with faba bean relative to MW. Intercropping sustained high or equal A and R-max for wheat under reduced one half N fertilizers as compared to MW due to the interaction of planting patterns x N levels. Intercropping generated yield and biomass advantages (Land equivalent ratio (LER) > 1, relative crowding coefficient (IC) > 0) at harvest though both biomass and yield of IB were lower than those of MB. Lower K, LER, and relative completion intensity of wheat (RCIw) with N rates were found only in 2016. However, intercropping showed a potential of reducing 5-15% N fertilizer application but still increased wheat yield by 16-30%. In conclusion, wheat and faba bean performance in intercropping is regulated by both growth pattern and N levels. Complementation in intercropping during mid- and late-growth stages is beneficial for stimulating wheat growth, reducing N fertilizer application rate, and maximizing the system productivity."

This practice may reduce weed pressure and contribute to providing N for OSR after service plant freezing. However, there is little knowledge of how plants interact together and with the soil in diverse annual crop mixtures. To assess these interactions, two contrasting legume service plants were selected: faba bean and grass pea, as well as a non-legume, the niger plant. OSR and the legumes were then grown in mesocosms alone or intercropped in mixtures of two to four species. The biomass, N contents, N-2 fixation, and soil substrate-induced respiration were measured. A single species mostly drove the total dry biomass and the amount of N accumulated by the cover, OSR and faba bean for dry weight and N contents, respectively. Grass pea was highly sensitive to competition with OSR, and its N-2 fixation was lower than that of faba bean. The addition of niger did not lead to additional N-2 fixation of legumes or total N accumulation and contributed to reducing OSR biomass. The specific composition of the plant mixture did not explain the soil microorganism activity.

Productivity of Intercropped Wheat with Faba Bean under Crop Sequences and Foliar Application of Humic Acid	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"Intercropping; Sole cropping; Foliar application; Wheat; Faba bean"	"GROWTH; ECONOMICS"	"INTERCROPPING cereal-legume (wheat + faba bean) is essential to enhance productivity per unit area, land use efficiency and decreasing the gap between production and consumption in Egypt. Furthermore, we are trying to find the best concentration of humic acid foliar application which could improve the production of wheat and faba bean. A field experiment was set with a combination of five crop sequences and intercropping systems (clover/wheat; wheat + faba bean; clover/wheat + faba bean; sole wheat; sole faba bean) in addition to, three foliar application treatments of humic acid at the rate of control (0.0), 2.0 and 4.0g/L. Results show that foliar application of humic acid and intercropping systems affected significantly all traits of wheat and faba bean except number of branches/plant and plant height in the first season for faba bean. The highest mean values of yield and its components of wheat were obtained when wheat was sown after clover under foliar application with 4g/L humic acid as compared with sole wheat with no foliar application in both seasons. The 2g/L humic acid and wheat + faba bean give higher land equivalent ratio and the lowest values of aggressivity. whereas the highest mean values of area time equivalent ratio and monetary advantage index were obtained from 4g/L humic acid foliar application with clover/wheat + faba bean in both seasons."

However, little is known about the ability of faba bean-rhizobium symbiosis to fix nitrogen in P-deficient soils and to transfer fixed nitrogen (N) to intercropped wheat. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM) and their extraradical hyphae networks play an important role in the facilitation process by promoting interconnectivity and the transfer of nutrients, such as N and P, between associated plants. The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of AM inoculation on N-2 fixation and the transfer of fixed N from faba bean to intercropped wheat. Germinated faba bean and wheat seeds were transferred into 1-l pots filled with a P-deficient soil that was collected from the Haouz valley near Marrakech (Morocco). Plants from the two species were grown in pots in either pure or mixed stands under greenhouse conditions, and each cropping system was subjected to three mycorrhizal inoculation treatments with a non-inoculated (AM0) and two concentrations of Rhizophagus irregularis inoculants containing 1000 (AM1) or 2000 (AM2) spores pot(-1). The N-15 isotope dilution method was used to determine the amount and proportion of atmospheric N fixed by faba bean (Ndfa%) and the fixed N that was transferred to wheat. Mycorrhizal inoculation had a significantly positive effect on the shoot dry weights and total shoot N in faba bean, but not in wheat. The cropping system had no significant effect on the plant growth and total shoot N in both faba bean and wheat. The Ndfa percentage was very high in all of the treatments, varying from 86 to 91%. The total N fixed by faba bean was 27% significantly higher in the AM2 treatment compared with the AM1 and AM0 treatments for both cropping systems combined. The estimated proportions of fixed N that were transferred from faba bean to wheat were far higher in AM1 (50%) and AM2 (32%) treatments than in AM0 (15%) treatment as well as for the total transferred fixed N. As corroborated by a parallel observation of root mycorrhizal colonization, these results suggest that the development of mycorrhizal networks stimulates the transfer of fixed N from faba bean to wheat, which could significantly contribute to the facilitation process under intercropping conditions.

J. Schrot in southwest China. The application of nitrogen fertilizer can possibly affect intercropped faba bean and wheat to control faba bean rust disease and increase the productivity of crops. To evaluate the effects of nitrogen levels and intercropping on the occurrence of faba bean rust disease and understand the mechanism involved, field trials in two planting seasons were conducted in 2016-2017 and 2017-2018. Four nitrogen levels ([NO] 0 kg ha(-1), [Ni] 45 kg ha(-1), [N2] 90 kg ha(-1) and [N3] 135 kg ha(-1)) and two planting patterns (faba bean monocropping and faba bean and wheat intercropping) were used. The epidemic characteristics of faba bean rust were simulated, and the canopy microclimate and nitrogen content in the plant tissues were measured. The results showed that the application of nitrogen significantly increased the maximum disease index (A) and the maximum instantaneous epidemic rate (R-max). The area under the disease progression curve (AUDPC) of monocropped and intercropped faba bean rust was the most deleterious at the N3 level. The application of nitrogen increased the nitrogen content of leaves and the relative humidity of the canopies of monocropped and intercropped faba bean during both planting seasons, while decreasing the temperature and transmittance of light. Compared with monocropping, intercropping significantly increased the yield of faba bean and reduced the AUDPC for faba bean rust disease, and the AUDPC decreased by 22.3-54.7% at the N0-N3 levels with the level of N2 serving as the most effective at reducing disease. Intercropping creates a micro-ecological environment that is not favorable for the occurrence of rust disease by significantly decreasing the relative humidity of the faba bean canopy and increasing the canopy temperature and transmittance of light. Moreover, the N content in the faba bean leaves was reduced and transferred to the pods, thus, enhancing the disease resistance of faba bean. In this study, consideration of the effects on controlling disease and the advantages of increasing yield led us to recommend the application of nitrogen at 45-90 kg ha(-1) as the most effective measure to control the occurrence of faba bean rust disease when faba bean and wheat were intercropped. This study provides a basis for the rational application of N fertilizer in faba bean and wheat intercropping systems, which simultaneously control crop disease and enhance crop yield.

Several methods have been tested to improve crop production but little information is available about the usage effect, of phosphate rock (PR) and compost on mixed cropping of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L. R. Br) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.). In this study, we investigated the effects of different PR application methods oil pearl millet. (millet) and cowpea Cropping systems. This study was carried out, at Senegal Agricultural Research Institute during the 2002 and 2003 rainy seasons, and comprised a sole millet, sole cowpea and millet-cowpea intercrop. Treatments were a control (Cont), 3 tons ha (1) of compost, (Com), 3 tons ha (1) of phospho-compost. (P-Com) and 3 tons ha (1) of compost plus Taiba Natural Phosphate (T-Com), replicated 4 times in a randomized complete block design. In sole millet, P-Com significantly increased the total dry weight compared to the control. Although P-Com was beneficial for intercrop millet, its increased yields through T-Coni were more significant,, giving evidence of the beneficial effect of mixed cropping oil the usage of local phosphate rock directly applied to soil. In contrast, such a beneficial effect was not, observed for cowpea which was likely not P limited growth, However, although sole crops gave higher yields, the Land Equivalent Ratios (LERs) over the two years indicated a greater advantage of applying treatments in the millet-cowpea intercrops except, two-P-Com (LER=0.93) which appeared to be more effective in sole cropping systems.				sarr.papa@voila.fr		SARR, Papa Saliou/0000-0002-4478-4463	IAEA/RAF/5/048/	IAEA/RAF/5/048/(International Atomic Energy Agency)	This study was supported by a grant from IAEA/RAF/5/048/ project, with the collaboration of Senegal, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, to fight against desertification in Sahel areas.		28	1	1	0	10	KYUSHU UNIV, FACULTY AGRICULTURAL PUBLICATIONS	FUKUOKA-SHI	6-10-1 HAKOZAKI, HIGASHI-KU, FUKUOKA-SHI, 812-0053, JAPAN	0023-6152			J FAC AGR KYUSHU U	J.

A field experiment was therefore conducted in the northern part of the Guinea Savanna in Ghana to compare the productivity of maize/cowpea mixed cropping, maize/cowpea relay intercropping with maize/cowpea rotation and maize monocropping over a 4-year period. The treatments included two levels of nitrogen (0 and 80 kg of N ha-1 y-1 as urea) and two levels of phosphorus application (0 and 60 kg of P ha-1 y-1 as Volta phosphate rock). At all levels of N and P application, maize yields of the intercropping systems, especially of maize/cowpea mixed cropping, were significantly lower than in sole cropping. Highest maize yields were obtained in maize/cowpea rotation, which in contrast to the other cropping systems did not show any reductions in yields over years. Cowpea yields were generally less affected by the cropping system, but were notably depressed when cowpea was relay-intercropped with maize. In treatments without fertilizer application (N and P) Land Equivalent Ratios (LER) and Area x Time Equivalency Ratios (ATER) generally indicated lower productivity of the intercropping systems as compared to sole cropping, with the maize/cowpea rotation showing the highest productivity. Conversely, fertilizer application resulted in higher productivity of the intercropping systems over the 4-year period. Productivity on the basis of ATER was generally lowest in maize/cowpea relay-intercropping as a consequence of the long time of land occupation. All of the parameters indicate low productivity of maize monocropping, clearly demonstrating that crop sequence as well as fertilizer application must be considered as important for maintaining high production levels at this site.

Nitrogen accumulated in soil organic matter during the pasture phase is mineralised following cultivation. It contributes greatly to the N nutrition of the subsequent cereal crops. A greenhouse experiment was carried out to determine the relative contribution of different N sources to the flush of mineralisation and plant N uptake that occurs when the pasture is ploughed-in and a cereal crop is grown. The N sources considered were recently immobilised urine N in urine patch areas of pasture soil, and N in pasture residues. Urine patch soil organic N and pasture plant N were labelled with N-15 under field conditions before cultivating the soil and initiating the experiment. Wheat plants recovered about 40% of the N-15 from labelled grass/clover residue and about 10% from previously immobilised urine-derived N-15. Nonetheless, 96-98% of the N accumulated by wheat plants originated from mineralised native soil organic N-14. This pool of soil organic N-14 was extremely large compared with labelled N-15 pools SO that even though less than 4% was mineralised during the experiment it contributed the bulk of the N to wheat plants. It is concluded that substantially more work is required to characterise the readily mineralisable pool of N that is accumulated under pasture before the fertility of mixed cropping soils is fully understood.

Farmers might be expected to 'demand' new forages only when they can see a financial benefit in the short-medium term. Opportunities for farmers to generate income from livestock production are increasing dramatically as demand for animal products increases across Asia and Africa. Most of this increased demand will be met from mixed cropping-livestock enterprises, in which the majority of tropical livestock are currently raised and where production is usually dependent on low-quality crop residues. Forage research in the future will Deed to provide farmers with the means to meet the increased demand for livestock products. The challenge will be to develop research strategies that identify well adapted forages that can improve livestock production and can be grown within the spatial and temporal constraints of complex and resource-limited mixed cropping-livestock farming systems; in addition, it will be necessary to provide appropriate information on the management and economic benefits of these forages. This paper presents 2 possible approaches. In a participatory action research program on the use of forage legumes in cropping systems in Zimbabwe, the keys to successful forage adoption in rural communities are seen as: the emerging market for livestock products; a motivated and educated extension service working with a range of research specialists; and the opportunities for beneficial synergies to be exploited from a mixed livestock-maize production system. Focused benchmarking of the communities identified farmers with sufficient resources and appropriate livestock systems to benefit from improved forage. In a rice-based Indonesian farming system, simulation of forage growth and livestock production is being used to examine the possible whole-of-farm. impacts of using planted forages prior to commencement of on-farm research. Identifying the most likely spatial and temporal opportunities for growing forages and incorporating them into the feed calendar can potentially avoid costly on-farm research on practices that have doubtful economic impact; moreover, this approach enables a wide range of options to be compared rapidly. To avoid the mistakes of the past, researchers need to provide supporting evidence that investment in new forages makes a difference not only to livestock production but also to household income. They will need to focus on farming systems such as mixed crop-livestock systems where farmers have total control over the forage they produce and where adoption can be shown to be economically sustainable. They also need to identify and target those farmers within rural communities with the resource capacity to invest in new farming practices."

In a pot-based experiment, rapeseed was grown alone (single rapeseed), or mixed with 3, 6, or 15 Chinese milk vetch plants. As controls, monocropped Chinese milk vetch was grown at the same planting density, 3, 6, or 15 plants per pot. Root interaction between rapeseed and Chinese milk vetch facilitated phosphorus (P) uptake in rapeseed grown with 3 plants of Chinese milk vetch. As the planting density of Chinese milk vetch in mixture increased, there was a decrease in citrate concentration and acid phosphatase activity but an increase in the total root length of Chinese milk vetch per pot, resulting in decreases in rapeseed root biomass, total root length and P uptake when rapeseed was grown with 6 or 15 Chinese milk vetch plants relative to rapeseed grown with 3 plants. These results demonstrate that the enhanced nutrient utilization induced by root interaction at low planting densities was eliminated by the increased planting density of the legume species in rapeseed/Chinese milk vetch mixed cropping system, suggesting that root/rhizosphere management through optimizing legume planting density is important for improving crop productivity and nutrient-use efficiency.

Fusaric acid (FA), produced by F. oxysporum, plays an important role in the occurrence of disease, and intercropping is an effective measure for control of disease and for improving host resistance in plants. The objective of this study was to investigate the physiological and biochemical responses, and mechanisms of tissue structure resistance, of intercropped faba beans following exposure to different concentrations of FA. Results demonstrated that intercropping reduced the occurrence of fusarium wilt, and improved faba bean growth and yield. In addition, wheat intercropping significantly reduced red ink absorption of faba bean (33.2%), increased water content (3.1%), and increased activity of the root antioxidant enzymes peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) (26.3% and 2.2.%, respectively). Furthermore, increased lignin content and callose deposition in plant vessels were observed (12.5% and 42.7%, respectively) when subjected to the highest concentration of FA stress (200 mg/L). Intercropping resulted in more intact root cell morphology, increased occurrence of intracellular vacuoles, increased cell wall thickness, and an increase in the number of mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum. Intercropping alleviated the wilting effect of FA on faba bean via enhanced physiological, biochemical, and tissue structure resistance of faba bean root.

However, little is known about when and how rhizosphere alteration of legumes plays a role in improving P uptake by cereals. Wheat was grown isolated, monocropped or intercropped with faba bean in pots with low-P soil. The biomass, P content, carboxylates and phosphatases activity were measured in 15 destructive samplings. Intraspecific competition of the biomass and P uptake of monocropped wheat was not significant before 40 and 36 days after sowing (DAS), whereas there was interspecific competition of biomass of intercropped wheat before 66 DAS. However, afterwards, the increments of the biomass and P uptake of the intercropped wheat were 1.3-1.9 and 1.9-2.3 times of increment of monocropped wheat. Meanwhile, the concentrations of malate and citrate and the acid phosphatase activity in the rhizospheres of intercropped wheat were significantly increased, which suggested that wheat/faba bean intercropping is efficient in P utilization due to complementary P uptake in the early growth stage and the positive interactions of the rhizosphere processes when the soil P was depleted.

Field experiments were carried out on a sandy loam soil and a sandy soil in Denmark over three consecutive cropping seasons including dual grain legume (pea, faba bean and lupin)-barley intercropping as compared to the respective sole crops (SC). Yield stability of intercrops (IC) was not greater than that of grain legume SC, with the exception of the IC containing faba bean. Faba bean and lupin had lower yield stability than pea and fertilized barley. However, the different IC used environmental resources for plant growth up to 50% (LER = 0.91-1.51) more effectively as compared to the respective SC, but with considerable variation over location, years and crops. The SC performance supported the interspecific interactions within the IC stand. On the sandy loam 13% greater grain yield of pea cv. Agadir (520 g m(-2)) was observed as compared to cv. Bohatyr. Faba bean and lupin yielded similarly (340 g m(-2)) in the sandy loam soil, with decreasing yields on the sandy soil (320-270 g m(-2)). Nitrogen fixation was very constant in grain legume SC over species and location, varying from 13.2 to 15.8 g N m(-2), being lowest in peas and highest in faba bean and lupin. The intercropped grain legumes increased the proportion of plant N derived from N-2-fixation by on average 10-15% compared to the corresponding SC. However, especially lupin was suppressed when intercropping, with a reduced N-2-fixation from 15 to 5-6 g N m(-2). The IC were particularly effective at suppressing weeds, capturing a greater share of available resources than SC. Weed infestation in the different crops was comparable; however, it tended to be the highest in sole cropped faba bean, lupin and unfertilized barley, where the application of urea to barley reduced the weed infestation by around 50%. Reduction in disease was observed in all IC systems compared to the corresponding SC, with a general disease reduction in the range of 20-40%. For one disease in particular (brown spot on lupin) disease reduction was almost 80% in the IC. Intercropping practices offer many advantages but improved understanding of the ecological mechanisms associated with planned spatial diversity, including additional benefits with associated diversity, is needed to enhance the benefits achieved."

Five factors describing soil fertility conditions and field history best differentiated the weed communities according to a discriminant model. The analysis shows that maize-based cropping systems with a high frequency of cereal cropping and a low frequency of noncereal crapping tended to be dominated by weeds such as Commelina spp. and Kyllinga squamulata. As soil fertility declined, Vernonia spp. and Eclipta prostrata became more important. Increased frequency of noncereal crops in mixed cropping with cereals was associated with reduced incidence of weeds such as Leucas martinicensis, Oldenlandia corymbosa, Spermacoce verticillata, Ludwigia hyssopifolia, Celosia laxa, and Ipomoea spp. Further diversification of cereal-based systems to obtain a reduced frequency of cereals is likely to increase the incidence of Dactyloctenium aegyptium in crop fields. The information provides guidance for technology development and transfer on weed control for intensifying systems in the northern Guinea savanna of Africa.

Biotic and abiotic stresses are, however, challenging the faba bean production in many countries. The foliar diseases of faba bean are among the major constraints for the production and productivity of faba bean. Recently, a new foliar disease Faba bean gall caused by plant debris and soil-borne pathogen (Olpidium viciaeK.) is rapidly spreading and causing high yield losses in Ethiopia. This review paper presents the distribution, impact, epidemiology, and biology of faba bean gall pathogen and principally illustrates how the application and investigation of the various diseases' management approaches such as avoiding crop residues, crop rotation, intercropping, use of elicitors to induce host resistance, use of resistant genotypes, bioagents, compost teas, plant extracts, and lastly use of chemical fungicides could be important to control the faba bean gall disease underlying in faba bean.

Especially, the combination of drought-adaptive upland crops (e.g. pearl millet or sorghum) and flood-adaptive lowland crop of rice would be beneficial to overcome the drought and flood conditions and to reduce the risks of crop failure. In our previous studies, we found that upland crop yield losses by flood stress was mitigated by mix-cropped rice, owing to the oxygen gas released from the rice roots into the aqueous rhizosphere. In the present study, we conducted two experiments to assess whether mixed cropping a drought-resistant cereal, pearl millet, would improve the performance of co-growing drought-susceptible crop, rice under drought conditions. In the field experiment, some grains were obtained from the rice plants mix-cropped with pearl millet under drought condition. However, no rice matured in the single cropping system. In the model experiment using deuterium analysis, it was confirmed that water absorbed by pearl millet roots from deep soil layer was utilized by rice, suggesting that mix-cropped rice could withstand drought stress and complete grain filling using water released into the upper soil layer by hydraulic lift.

J	"Ajal, J; Weih, M"				"Ajal, James; Weih, Martin"			Nutrient Accumulation Pattern in Mixtures of Wheat and Faba Bean Is Strongly Influenced by Cultivar Choice and Co-Existing Weeds	BIOLOGY-BASEL			English	Article						"scaling exponent; cereal-legume; weed competition; species mixtures; nutrient accumulation; plant-plant interaction"	"PEA-BARLEY INTERCROPS; SOIL N; COMPETITION; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; GROWTH; PRODUCTIVITY; INCREASES; CROPS; YIELD"	Simple Summary Growing a mixture of two or more crop species, particularly cereals and legumes, can enhance resource use efficiency for growth-limiting resources, such as nutrients. We evaluated the patterns of nutrient accumulation efficiency in different cultivars of faba bean and wheat grown in mixtures with and without the presence of weeds in a growth container experiment. The cultivar used in the mixture determined the amount of nitrogen accumulated by the legumes, but cereals generally accumulated more nitrogen in the mixtures than when grown as sole crops. Competition from weeds resulted in lower nitrogen accumulation in the crop plants, and plant neighbor identity affected the accumulation of other nutrients relative to the accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorus in the plants. Cultivar choice is therefore important for resource limitation and thereby the growth performance of plants grown in mixtures. Cereal-legume mixtures are often associated with higher yields than the components grown as sole crops, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. The study aims to evaluate how different cultivars in a two-species wheat-faba bean mixture influence above- and below-ground nitrogen (N) accumulation in the plant biomass, whether crop mixing affected the accumulation of other nutrients relative to the accumulation of N and phosphorus (P), and how the nutrient accumulation pattern in sole crops and mixtures is influenced by weed competition. Using a growth container experiment, we investigate nutrient accumulation patterns on specific wheat and faba bean cultivars grown as sole crops and mixtures, and with and without weed competition. We found that cereals in the mixture accumulated more N than in the sole crops, and the cultivar used influenced biomass accumulation in the legumes. Competition from weeds reduced the amount of plant N pools accumulated in the crop plant biomass. Based on stoichiometric scaling exponents, the plant neighbor affected the accumulation of other nutrients relative to the accumulation of N and P. These results are relevant for species and cultivar selection, all of which are important prerequisites for maximizing mixture performance.

Digestates were sampled from two different biogas facilities before and after solid-liquid separation and were analyzed with regard to their composition and phosphorus (P) fractions. Additionally, to investigate the P fertilizer effects of these digestates in comparison with undigested slurry or TripleSuper-P (TSP), they were applied in a pot experiment (6 kg soil per pot) in an amount corresponding to 200 mg P per pot in combination with various crops (amaranth, maize, maize + beans mixed cropping, sorghum). A separation of digestates resulted in higher P concentrations of the solid fraction in comparison with the liquid fraction. The proportion of the readily soluble P fractions (H2O-P, NaHCO3-P) to the total P was higher than 70 % in all digestates. The digestates increased P uptake of the tested crops and concentrations of bioavailable P in the soil to the same extent as highly soluble TSP. Activities of soil enzymes were lower after application of the digestates in comparison to unfermented slurry. The fertilizer management of digestates can be improved by a solid-liquid separation since the solid fraction showed a relatively high concentration of P resulting in a reduction in application doses required to meet the P demands of crops.

The increasing interest in sustainable tools for disease control, together with the lack of sufficient levels of genetic resistance triggered our interest in the use of intercropping as a tool for the management of this disease. The effect of intercropping on chocolate spot severity was studied in field experiments performed in Egypt, the Palestinian Territories, Spain and Tunisia, in which a susceptible faba bean cultivar was grown as a monocrop or with two mixed species intercrops of either barley, oat, triticale, wheat, pea or common vetch, or with three mixed species intercrops of wheat and berseem clover. Chocolate spot was significantly reduced when faba bean was intercropped with cereals, but not when intercropped with legumes. Suppressive effects can be ascribed to a combination of host biomass reduction, altered microclimate and physical barriers to spore dispersal. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Two leguminous weed species which are widely distributed in annual crops of the Ethiopian highlands have been studied with varying coverage in greenhouse trials in Ethiopia with regard to their suitability as underseeds and with wheat (Triticum turgidum [L.] Thell. var. durum [Desf.] MacKey) as a main crop. The competitive effects of Scorpiurus muricatus L. on the grain yield of wheat were smaller than those of Medicago polymorpha L. (-14.1 % and -23.6 % respectively, compared with the underseed free control) which is mainly ascribed to differences in their speed of development and shoot height, The residual effects of the underseed's root masses on the grain yield of the successive teff crop (Eragrostis tef [Zucc.] Trotter) were significantly higher with Scorpiurus muricatus (+99.3 %) than with Medicago polymorpha (63.6 %). The results are discussed with regard to the specific site conditions in the cereal-dominated cropping systems of the Ethiopian highlands.

Intercropping of Faba Bean with Barley at Various Spatial Arrangements Affects Dry Matter and N Yield, Nitrogen Nutrition Index, and Interspecific Competition	NOTULAE BOTANICAE HORTI AGROBOTANICI CLUJ-NAPOCA			English	Article						"competition; financial yield; growth rate; indices; protein content"	"FORAGE YIELD; USE EFFICIENCY; COMMON VETCH; PEA; GROWTH; OAT; MIXTURES; WHEAT; ADVANTAGES; SYSTEMS"	Intercropping is the cultivation of two or more crop species on the same area of land, and can improve yield, forage quality, and soil health. Despite the fact that intercropping is an old practice, it received significant attention the last years because of the environmental impact that it has. However, the effect of the various spatial arrangements of the different species that are used in an intercropping system was not determined. The objective of the present study was to study the yield, growth and nitrogen (N) uptake rate, N nutrition index (NNI) of barley, interspecific competition, quality and financial outcome of intercrops of faba bean (Vicia faba L. var. equina) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) with various spatial arrangements (1:1, 2:2, 2: 1 alternate rows, and mixed in the same row). The land equivalent ratio (LER), relative crowding coefficient (K), actual yield loss (AYL) and system productivity index (SPI) values were greater for the FB:B intercrop of 2:1, indicating the advantage of intercropping in terms of dry matter and N yield. Sole cropping of barley showed a reduction in NNI by 7 %, whereas NNI for barley increased by an average of 14% in intercropping treatments. Based on biomass production and the competition indices for dry matter and N yield, and NNI the FB:B intercrop of 2:1 was more advantageous than faba bean and barley monocrops, as well as the other intercropping treatments that were tested.

Across the three N treatments and two experiments, it was frequently observed that intercropping increased but N fertilization decreased the nodule number and nodule dry weight of faba bean. Six types of flavonoids were detected in the faba bean root secretion, but only genistein, hesperetin, and naringenin often had significant correlations with the nodule number and nodule dry weight. Intercropping increased faba bean root secretions of genistein, hesperetin, and naringenin compared to monoculture only at the deficient and adequate N supply levels. The differences in flavonoids of faba bean caused by the intercropped patterns, N supply levels, and their interactions were mainly significant at flowering stage. In conclusion, interspecies and N supply interactively altered the contents and proportions of flavonoids in faba bean root exudations under wheat and faba bean intercropping. These findings provide insight into flavonoids-nodule-yield interactions in cereal and legume intercropping systems.

The impacts of intercropping of canola (Ca) with faba beans (Fb), field peas (Fp), garlic (G), or wheat (Wh) were evaluated on the cabbage aphid, Brevicoryne brassicae (Linnaeus, 1758), natural enemies and canola yields in row ratios of 3Ca : 3Fb, 3Ca : Fp, 3Ca : 3G, and 3Ca : 3Wh in 2018 and 2019. In both years, the lowest aphid population was recorded in 3Ca : 3G. In 2018, the aphid population was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in 3Ca : 3Fp than in the monoculture, while, in 2019, it was lower in the intercrops compared to the monoculture. Furthermore, none of the intercrops, except 3Ca : 3Fb, showed a significant increase in the predator diversity and parasitism rate. The dry seed weight loss was higher in the monoculture and 3Ca : 3Wh than in the other intercrops. Based upon the obtained results, decreasing the density of the cabbage aphid and increasing the canola yield by intercropping canola with the faba bean, the field pea or garlic is possible with this system. The inferences of these outcomes, which are associated with the integrated pest management (IPM) in canola cropping systems, are discussed.

We aimed to evaluate the role of wheat in alleviating Fusarium wilt in faba bean. Methods We assessed the effect of wheat on the occurrence of Fusarium wilt in faba bean and analyzed the differences in the root exudates produced by faba bean in monocropping and intercropping systems before and after infection by FOF. Results Treatment with FOF increased the incidence and disease index of Fusarium wilt and significantly increased the number of rhizosphere pathogens. Phenolic acids, organic acids, amino acids and sugars exuded from the roots of faba bean increased by 39.1%, 329.0%, 921.7% and 1195.7%, respectively, while intercropping reduced them by 28.04%, 55.69%, 79.10% and 78.75%, respectively. The rhizosphere pathogens of faba bean decreased significantly following intercropping, and the incidence of Fusarium wilt dropped to tolerable levels. Conclusions This study suggests that the inoculation with FOF stimulated the exudation of phenolic acids, organic acids, amino acids and sugars from faba bean roots. These compounds were closely related to the changes in the disease resistance of faba bean and could also be used as nutrients to promote pathogen proliferation. After intercropping with wheat, the exudates of faba bean decreased significantly, which may imply that the faba bean recovered from stress, reduced the amount of nutrients needed for pathogen growth, limited the proliferation of pathogens and contributed to the alleviation of Fusarium wilt.

J	VOGEL, H				VOGEL, H			THE NEED FOR INTEGRATED WEED MANAGEMENT-SYSTEMS IN SMALLHOLDER CONSERVATION FARMING IN ZIMBABWE	TROPENLANDWIRT			English	Article								This study in Zimbabwe revealed that conservation tillage systems subjected to continuous maize production to lead to unacceptably high levels of perennial weed infestation within six years. Traditional hoe weeding proved unable to control the rapid build-up of perennial weeds, most likely because seeds were not buried deep enough and the observed deep tap roots and the rhizomes could not sufficiently be lifted out of the soil. Similarly, blade weeders designed to cut through weed roots at shallow depth did not cope adequately with prolific perennials. In fact, perennials may even have reproduced from cuttings. However, the tested blade weeders reduced weeding time considerably compared to hoe weeding and are thus well suited for controlling newly emerged annuals. Preseeding herbicide application using glyphosate at a rate of 2.2 kg ai ha(-1) or intercropping maize with cow peas and pumkins showed greatest potential as alternative weed management options. They both suppressed perennial weeds effectively. Intercropping also had the additional benefit of increasing overall crop production thus minimizing the always present risk of total crop failure in continuous smallholder maize production. Since mixed cropping also is a traditional practice, it appears to be the most promising and appropriate weed management option for further promotion and extension in smallholder conservation fanning.

In South Africa particularly, the frequent occurrence of drought is a challenge for livestock farming and, coping strategies to mitigate feed gaps on smallholder farms are urgently needed. We chose the Limpopo province, of northern South Africa to study livestock farmers' perceptions of the temporal patterns of feed gaps and their perceived impacts on livestock production across different agro-ecological zones (AEZ) and farm types (i.e., livestock only, mixed crop-livestock farms). We combined a semi structured questionnaire on ninety farms with data from herbage analysis (mineral nutrient concentrations of grasses grazed in winter). Additionally, we explored the effect of seasonal feed availability on feed gaps, expressed as gross primary productivity (GPP), based on long-term simulated vegetation data. We found a close correlation between farmers' perceived feed gaps and GPP (Pearson's r = 0.77, p < 0.01). Farmers' perceptions of feed gaps are related to precipitation deficits that restrict rangeland productivity especially in winter and spring across the AEZ. Consequently, farmers considered that feed gaps occur mainly in winter (80%) followed by spring (30%) and autumn (20%). In addition, our analysis demonstrated that in winter the mineral concentration in rangeland biomass is inadequate to meet the livestock feed requirements. The percentages of farmers who perceived feed gaps and animal weight loss in the winter season did not differ significantly between farm types (p = 0.40) and AEZ (p = 0.41). Among livestock-only farmers, feed gaps were perceived to occur more in autumn (p < 0.01) whereas for mixed crop-livestock farmers the feed gap perception was greater in spring (p < 0.01). Farmers located in the drier zone perceived feed gaps more in spring (p < 0.05), leading to the significant perception of livestock weight loss for that period (p < 0.01). As strategies to deal with feed gaps, farmers rely on crop residues and/or reduction of livestock numbers. To improve the sustainability of the livestock system, our results show that feed gaps follow a strong seasonal pattern and they suggest that intervention strategies do not necessarily need to account for local climatic differences but rather for farm operation types.

In this study, integrated soil-crop management (ILMsoil), improved management (IMsoil) and conventional management (CMsoil) was studied to enhance the soil carbon sequestration for mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The life cycle assessment (LCA) approach was used to estimate carbon footprint from successive crops of rice, mustard and jute with or without intercrops or mixed crops. The adoption of ILMsoil helped in reducing the carbon footprint by 78%. The overall economic yield increased by 25% over IMsoil as well. Net CO2-eq emission was 68% less under ILMsoil as compared to other systems. The reduction in net LCA-GHG emission was mainly due to high SOC sequestration by jute crop and leguminous intercrops and mixed crops. Improved crop diversification and agronomic productivity as used in ILMsoil system may decrease the inputs of non-renewable energy and consequently reduce the emission of GHGs from agroecosystems. Improvement of soil health, minimization in nutrient and water losses, and application of the increased amount of organic fertilizers were found helpful in reducing the carbon footprint. ILMsoil method of cultivation in 0.70 million hectare of jute growing area may reduce about 0.40 million tonnes of CO2-eq from atmosphere every year and provide carbon credit of 1.22 million US$to the farmers of eastern India.

The underlying mechanisms are associated with above- and below-ground nutrient (e.g., nitrogen) availability, uptake, and use efficiency. The aims of this study were to identify the effect of the N availability improvement on yield of intercrops and to explore soil N transformation rates in rhizosphere soil of wheat/faba bean intercrops, as compared with their sole crops. Materials and methods In a field experiment, crops productivity was measured and rhizosphere soils of intercropped and monocropped wheat/faba bean were collected to examine changes of soil gross N transformation rates via a nitrogen-15 (N-15) incubation study. Results and discussion Intercropping significantly increased the productivity. Grain yields of intercropped faba bean and wheat were 11.4 and 34.2% higher than those of the corresponding monocrops, respectively. The gross and net rates of organic N mineralization and nitrification, as well as the gross mineral N immobilization rates were considerably greater in intercropping compared to the sole cropping system. The results suggested that the increased grain yield during intercropping was related to an improved capacity of N supply and conservation in soils via an intensification of the mineralization-immobilization turnover (MIT) and intercropping enhanced mineral N availability. Conclusions Our findings demonstrated that wheat/faba bean intercropping was able to significantly increase the productivity of both companion crops under subtropical condition. The environmental implication of NO3- leaching and runoff under monocropping conditions could be alleviated by adopting an intercropping management.

A field study thus determined the effect of intercropping maize with four popular food crops, over two major seasons of tropical Asia. The bean (Phaseolus spp.) intercrop had no significant impact on growth and yields of maize, while cassava (Manihot esculenta) had the most significant adverse effect. The impact of tomato (Lycospersicon esculentum) and sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) on maize was in-between those of beans and cassava. The bean, tomato and sweet potato - maize intercrops have LER values greater than unity, while that of cassava maize was lower than 1. Optimizing maize production and resource use in smallholder systems through mixed or intercropping thus requires the selection of suitable crop species.

Positive intercropping effects on biomass production are species-specific and involve rhizosphere enzyme activities: Evidence from a field study	SOIL ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	"Article; Early Access"						"Enzyme kinetic parameters; Phosphorus mobilization; Nitrogen fixation; Niche complementarity; Biomass increase; Relative interaction index"	"SOIL MICROBIAL BIOMASS; INTERSPECIFIC FACILITATION; PHOSPHORUS ACQUISITION; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; NUTRIENT-UPTAKE; ORGANIC-MATTER; WHITE LUPIN; NITROGEN; DIVERSITY; HYPOTHESIS"	Less attention has been given to soil enzymes that contribute to beneficial rhizosphere interactions in intercropping systems. Therefore, we performed a field experiment by growing faba bean, lupine, and maize in mono and mixed cultures in a moderately fertile soil. We measured shoot biomass and the kinetic parameters (maximal velocity (V-max) and Michaelis-constant (K-m)) of three key enzymes in the rhizosphere: Leucine-aminopeptidase (LAP), beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), and phosphomonoesterase (PHO). Faba bean benefitted in mixed cultures by greater shoot biomass production with both maize and lupine compared to its expected biomass in monoculture. Next, LAP and NAG kinetic parameters were less responsive to mono and mixed cultures across the crop species. In contrast, both the V max and K m values of PHO increased in the faba bean rhizosphere when grown in mixed cultures with maize and lupine. A positive relative interaction index for shoot P and N uptake for faba bean showed its net facilitative interactions in the mixed cultures. Overall, these results suggest that over-productivity in intercropping is crop-specific and the positive intercropping effects could be modulated by P availability. We argue that the enzyme activities involved in nutrient cycling should be incorporated in further research.

Land-equivalent ratio (LER) and competition ratio (CR) indices were also assessed. Two-year mean annual dry-matter (DM) yield of all intercrops averaged 17.2 t ha(-1) and this was greater than that of both faba bean sole crops, which averaged 12.7 t ha(-1). However, intercrop DM was significantly lower than that of oat sole crop, which averaged 24.9 t ha(-1). The most productive intercrop was that of faba bean-oat at 25-75 seeding ratio. The intercropped oat had higher LER than either of the intercropped faba bean cultivars, indicating an advantage for oat intercropped with faba bean. The results of this study indicated that faba bean-oat intercrops provided higher total DM and protein yields than those of faba bean sole crop, but lower or similar yields to oat as a sole crop. Results are discussed in the context of providing forages in Mediterranean environments that are of balanced nutritional value. Thus, intercropping of either of the tested faba bean cultivars with oat (cv. Cassandra) at a 25-75 seeding ratio could be used as an alternative to faba bean sole crop or faba bean-cereals intercrops for satisfactory forage and protein yield.	"[Dhima, K. V.; Paschalidis, K.

Here we determined whether intercropping affects decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) and root litter. Methods We measured in the laboratory and the field the breakdown of SOM, root litter of maize, wheat, or faba bean, litter mixtures, and a standard substrate (compost) in soils from a long term intercropping experiment. Results Soil organic matter from intercrop plots decomposed faster than SOM from monocrop plots, but compost decomposed at similar rates in different soils. Faster SOM decomposition was associated with lower soil C:N ratio. Root litter mixtures of maize and wheat decomposed as expected from single litters, but litter mixture of maize and faba bean decomposed faster than expected, both in the laboratory and in the field. Root litter decomposed slowly in maize/wheat intercrop soil compared to the two monocropped soils in the laboratory, but the effect was absent in the field. Conclusions Intercropping increases SOM decomposition, presumably through reduced SOM recalcitrance resulting from lower C:N ratio, higher litter input and better N retention. Depending on the crop combination, also non-additive effects of root litter mixing can enhance organic matter decomposition in intercropping soils.

Cinnamic Acid Increased the Incidence of Fusarium Wilt by Increasing the Pathogenicity of Fusarium oxysporum and Reducing the Physiological and Biochemical Resistance of Faba Bean, Which Was Alleviated by Intercropping With Wheat	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						"intercropping; physiological resistance; Fusarium wilt; Fusarium oxysporum; faba beans; cinnamic acid"	"OXIDATIVE STRESS; SOIL SICKNESS; IN-VITRO; GROWTH; WATERMELON; AUTOTOXIN; ROOTS; L."	Background Continuous cropping has resulted in the accumulation of self-toxic substances in faba beans which has restricted their global production. Intercropping is widely used to alleviate these problems. Aims To explore the role of cinnamic acid stress in faba bean physiology and disease resistance, and the potential mitigating effects of intercropping the faba bean with wheat. Methods Faba bean seedlings were grown with or without wheat in both field and hydroponic conditions in the presence of different cinnamic acid concentrations and Fusarium oxysporum (FOF), the occurrence of. Fusarium-mediated wilt and oxidative stress, as well as plant growth indices and the anti-pathogen defense system were analyzed. Results Cinnamic acid significantly increased Fusarium pathogenicity, inhibited the activity of defense enzymes and reduced the ability of plants to resist pathogens, indicating the importance of cinnamic acid in the promotion of Fusarium wilt resulting in reduced seedling growth. Intercropping with wheat improved plant resistance by alleviating cinnamic acid-induced stress, which promoted crop growth and decreased the incidence and disease index of Fusarium wilt. Conclusion Cinnamic acid promotes Fusarium wilt by stimulating pathogen enzyme production and destroying the defense capability of faba bean roots. Intercropping reduces Fusarium wilt by alleviating the damage caused by cinnamic acid to the defense system of the faba bean root system.

Fungal infection and aflatoxin levels were evaluated in 300 farmers' stores in four agro-ecological zones over 2 years (1993-1995), at the beginning of storage (sample A) and 6 months later (sample B). Aspergillus flavus infected 10-20% of the kernels in sample A (1993-1994). In sample B, 54-79% of the kernels were infected with A. flavus. In 1994-1995, A. flavus infection was higher in sample A (27-47%) than B (8-26%). Fusarium species were found in 38-58% of the kernels in sample A in both years, but decreased slightly to 29-51% in sample B. Significant agroecozonal effects existed within sampling, but were not consistent between samplings and years. Of the total number of samples collected (744), 38.8% were found to be aflatoxin-positive, with an average of 105 parts per billion (ppb) and 60% of the aflatoxin-positive samples having a contamination approximately 20 ppb, the intervention level recommended by the World Health Organization. Factors associated with increased aflatoxin were: planting local maize varieties in southern Benin, intercropping with cowpea, groundnut, or cassava, use of urea-fertilizer, damage to maize in the field, prolonged harvesting, long drying periods in the field, and winnowing. Practices that reduced aflatoxin contamination were: planting improved varieties in northern Benin, mixed cropping with vegetables, use of NPK-fertilizer, drying of harvested cobs for 60-90 days, drying ears without the husk, sorting out of poor quality ears.

Effects of intercropping and Rhizobial inoculation on the ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms in rhizospheres of maize and faba bean plants	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY			English	Article						"Intercropping; Rhizobial; Rhizosphere; qPCR; T-RFLP"	"BACTERIA; ARCHAEA; SOIL; DIVERSITY; WHEAT; PRODUCTIVITY; COMMUNITIES; CHICKPEA; SYSTEMS; NITRATE"	"To clarify whether intercropping and the Rhizobium leguminosarum inoculation affected the nitrification and subsequent nitrate leaching in soil, quantitative and qualitative analyses of total bacteria (TB), total archaea (TA), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) in the rhizospheres of maize and faba bean were performed. The greater abundances of TB than TA and of AOA than AOB were observed in all the samples, with ratios of TB:TA 21.1 and 8.0; and AOA:AOB 24.5 and 2.3, at the anthesis and pod-bearing stages, respectively. In faba bean rhizosphere, the intercropping and/or inoculation of rhizobia decreased the abundances of TB, TA, AOB and AOA at the anthesis stage; and inoculation of rhizobia alone decreased AOA at the pod-bearing stage. In maize rhizosphere, intercropping alone only enhanced the AOA at the pod bearing stage; while the combination of intercropping and rhizobial inoculation decreased the TA at the anthesis stage, and enhanced TB, AOB and AOA at the pod-bearing stage. The diversity of AOB and AOA were pronounced by intercropping and rhizobial inoculation treatments: at the anthesis stage for AOB and at the pod-bearing stage for AOA. However, Nitrosospira always remained as the predominant AOB in all the treatments. Conclusively, intercropping and rhizobial inoculation brought various shifts in microbial abundance and community compositions in rhizosphere depending on the plants and growth stages, which may decrease the nitrification in rhizosphere. Furthermore, the combination of intercropping and rhizobial inoculation presented stronger effects in most cases than the separated treatments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Supplemental N fertiliser applications are likely needed in such systems because the availability of legume-derived N may not match peak tree N demand, but this added N fertiliser will likely suppress biological N-2 fixation (%BNF) in the inter-row legumes. We hypothesised that some legume species may be less susceptible to N fertiliser-induced suppression of %BNF and are therefore better suited as legume inter-row crops. We compared the impact of four rates of N fertiliser (0, 50, 100 and 150 kg N ha(-1)) on %BNF in faba bean (Vicia faba) and chickpea (Cicer arietinum) when cultivated as inter-row legume crops in an established Melaleuca alternifolia plantation and as a monoculture in a glasshouse pots trial. N2 fixation was not completely suppressed in either species at 150 kg N ha(-1), with around 40 %BNF maintained in faba bean in the field and glasshouse and around 35 %BNF and 23 %BNF maintained in chickpea in the field and glasshouse, respectively. Faba bean had significantly higher %BNF than chickpea at 100 kg N ha(-1) when intercropped in the field, and at 100 and 150 kg N ha(-1) in the glasshouse, associated with a higher shoot N demand in faba bean. The results suggest that where soil conditions are suitable for either species, faba bean is more suitable as a green manure intercrop than chickpea when supplementary N fertiliser additions are required.

(Ostro, Altgold, KR 489-11-15, Oberkulmer, Ostroschwarzer, Lueg, H9227, H9228, Rouquin, Hercule) and winter common wheat Triticum aestivum L. variety Samara were cultivated in Ceske Budejovice under the low input conditions during years 1996-1998. A mixed crop was cultivated in the preceding year and no nitrogen fertilisation was applied after the foregoing crop harvest. Chemical composition was analysed in the wheat and spelt grains - content of total nitrogenous compounds was determined using Kjeldahl method and amino acid contents were determined using an analyser AAA-339. Mean content of nitrogenous compounds in spelt grains was for about 0.5 % higher than in common wheat grain and this difference was not statistically significant. Old Swiss varieties Ostro (12.52 %) and Oberkulmer (12.60 %), and also new breeding material KR 489-11-15 (13.72 %) had a little higher content of nitrogenous compounds. KR 489-11-15 had also higher content of lysine (4.21 g/kg). There was found the positive correlation between nitrogenous compounds and lysine contents. Within essential amino acids, there were observed significantly increased contents of lysine and threonine among varieties KR 489-11-15, Oberkulmer and Rouquin. From the viewpoint of nutritional value (content of essential amino acids), it would be suitable to focus on the new breeding material KR 489-11-15.

Productivity, economic performance, and soil quality of conventional, mixed, and organic dryland farming systems in eastern Washington State	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"Crop-livestock integration; Perennial; Organic agriculture; Soil quality; Economic performance"	"CROP-LIVESTOCK SYSTEMS; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; GREEN-MANURE; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; INCORPORATING SHEEP; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; MATTER DYNAMICS; DEEPER SOIL"	"The global trends of shortening crop rotations, simplifying cropping systems, and segregating livestock from cropping enterprises have generated high yields while creating high environmental costs. Diversification, including integrated crop/livestock systems and the use of cover, forage, and perennial crops, can be used to improve soil health, reduce financial risk, increase yields, and reduce many negative environmental externalities. With such diversification in mind, we conducted a 5-year study examining four contrasting farming systems in dryland eastern Washington State in terms of their impacts on total productivity, economic performance, and soil quality. The four systems were a conventional (CONV) winter wheat/spring wheat/spring pea rotation, typical for the area; a mixed crop-livestock (MIX) winter wheat/spring wheat/grazed winter pea forage rotation; an organic mixed crop-livestock (ORGcrop) rotation of 3 yr perennial alfalfa and grass/grazed pea forage/winter wheat; and an organic hay (ORGhay) continuous perennial alfalfa and grass system. Soft white winter wheat (SWWW) yields were higher following grazed pea forage in MIX (6.2 Mg ha(-1)) than following harvested pea crop in CONV (5.9 Mg ha(-1)) despite lower N fertilizer rates in MIX. Following 3 yr of alfalfa and grass hay and no N fertilizer, SWWW yields in ORGcrop (6.2 Mg ha(-1)) were similar to CONV and MIX yields but averaged 15.5% lower protein concentration. Over the 5-yr rotation, average net returns were ORGhay ($616 yr(-1))> ORGcrop (216 yr(-1))> MIX (-1 yr(-1)) = CONV (-13 yr(-1)), in part due to high hay prices and average grain prices during this period compared to long-term averages. Over the course of the study, total soil profile SOC showed significant negative trends in CONV (-3.1 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) and MIX (-4.1 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) but not in ORGcrop and ORGhay. In surface (0-15 cm) soil, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen and beta-glucosidase activity were greater in ORGcrop and ORGhay than in CONV and MIX. The landscape position of this study site is of relatively poorer soil quality and results may differ across the heterogeneity of a whole farm field. Overall, ORGhay, ORGcrop, MIX, and CONV in this order produced a gradation of forage production relative to cereal production from greatest to least, and also a gradation of economic and soil sustainability metrics from greatest to least. This study found that integrating perennial crops, such as alfalfa and forage grasses, into organic farming systems can build soil quality, be profitable, and supply nitrogen to succeeding grain crops."

Response of faba bean to intercropping, biological and chemical control against broomrape and root rot diseases	SAUDI JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						"Orobanche crenate; AMF; Yeast extract; Rizolex-T; Glyphosate; Aioub)"	"ANTAGONISTIC YEASTS; INTEGRATED CONTROL; FUSARIUM-WILT; DAMPING-OFF; OROBANCHE; FIELD; MANAGEMENT; CROPS; BIOCONTROL; RESISTANCE"	Multispecies cropping systems contribute to sustainable agriculture with multiple ecosystem services. Effects of intercropping of various crops with faba beans on growth and yield parameters and disease severity of root rot, damping off and broomrape were investigated. This study was implemented in the laboratory, greenhouse and field to investigate the effect of the intercropping systems (fenugreek + faba bean, lupine + faba bean, garlic + faba bean and sole faba bean). The intercropping systems were combined with the application of arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF) and yeast as bio-control agents, compared to chemical application of herbicides (Glyphosate) and fungicides (Rizolex-T50), to control rot root diseases and broomrape weeds, Orobanche spp., of faba bean plants in vivo and under the naturally infested field. In vitro, yeast and Rizolex-T50 significantly inhibited mycelial growth of root pathogenic fungi. Intercropping with garlic and/or application of Rizolex-T, significantly decreased the incidence and disease index of root rot and damping-off diseases, meanwhile increased percentage of survival plants. In vivo, intercropping with fenugreek and/or application of Glyphosate, significantly reduced the number/weight of spikes/plot of broomrapes. Intercropping with fenugreek combined with AMF application promoted crop growth and significantly increased yield components. The AMF enhanced seed yield/ha when applied to the intercropping of faba bean + fenugreek and faba bean + garlic, showing the highest seed yield/ha with 3.722 and 3.568 ton/ha, respectively. Intercropping of faba bean with garlic integrated with AMF revealed the highest values of LER, 2.45, and net return, 2341 US$/ha. Our results suggested that using faba bean-garlic intercrop along with AMF inoculation can reduce root rot disease, damping off and broomrapes, as well as enhance the profitability of Egyptian farmer and sustainable production.

Grain legumes were dominant in intercrops on the sandy loam soil, except for lupin, whereas barley was dominant in intercrops on the sandy soil site. Combined intercrop grain yields were comparable to grain yields of the respective sole cropped grain legume or sole cropped, fertilized barley on each soil site. On the sandy loam soil, pea-barley and faba bean-barley intercrops increased the proportion of plant N derived from N-2 fixation in grain legumes and increased the barley grain N concentration (from 1-7 to 2-2 mg/g) compared with sole cropping. However, the later maturity of faba bean compared with barley caused problems at harvest. The grain N concentration of intercropped barley was increased where grain legumes were the dominant intercrops and not on the sandy soil site. Lupin-barley intercrops did not show intercropping advantages to the same degree as faba bean and pea, but lupin constituted a more stable yield proportion of the combined intercrop yield over locations. Furthermore, the study indicated that the natural N-15 abundance at certain locations might not always be sufficient to ensure a reliable estimate of N-2 fixation using the N-15 natural abundance method.

Here we report a pot experiment that investigated the mechanisms underlying the marked improvement in Fe nutrition of peanut grown in mixture with maize. Iron deficiency chlorosis occurred in the young leaves of peanut in monoculture and was particularly obvious at the flowering stage, while the young leaves of peanut grown in mixture with maize remained green throughout the experiment. The chlorophyll and HCl-extractable Fe concentrations in young leaves of peanut grown in mixture were much higher than those in monoculture, indicating that maize may have markedly improved the peanut Fe nutrition. Growth in mixture was associated with greatly altered root morphology and microbial populations in the rhizosphere of peanut. Visual observation of peanut roots in monoculture showed that they were larger in diameter and shorter than those in mixture. Moreover, peanut roots in mixture with maize produced more lateral roots and had increased root length compared with plants in monoculture. Peanut grown together with maize showed obvious rhizodermal transfer cells in the subapical root zone, but cells with cell wall ingrowths were poorly developed in peanut in monoculture. Mixed culture resulted in a significantly decreased abundance of bacteria in the rhizosphere of peanut compared with monoculture, and electron microscope observations indicated that this was associated with a thicker mucigel layer on the root surface of peanut in mixture with maize. Several root morphological and rhizosphere microbial factors may thus have contributed to the improvement in Fe nutrition of peanut in mixed culture.

In the harsh environments of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and West Asia and North Africa (WANA), water is the principal factor limiting crop yield. A review has been carried out on soil and crop management research that can increase the water use efficiency. The WANA production systems are dominated by cereals, primarily wheat in the wetter and barley in the drier areas, in rotation with mainly food legumes such as chickpea, lentil and forage legumes. The SSA production systems are generally characterized by cereal/ legume mixed-cropping dominated by maize, millet, sorghum, and wheat. The major constraints in both regions to crop production are low soil fertility, insecure rainfall, low-productive genotypes, low adoption of improved soil and crop management practices, and lack of appropriate institutional support. Different cropping systems and accompanying technologies are discussed as well as selected examples of impact of these technologies. Results indicate that there is an advantage to apply these technologies but being function of socio-economic and bio-physical conditions. It is recommended that future research focuses on integrated technology development while taking into account also different levels of scale such as field, village, and watershed.

Intensification of conservation agriculture systems for increased livestock feed and maize production in Zimbabwe	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						"crop-livestock interaction; fodder production; no-tillage; residue retention; mixed farming systems; intensification"	"FARMING SYSTEMS; COVER CROPS; NITROGEN; FORAGE; MANAGEMENT; QUALITY; CHALLENGES; DYNAMICS; FALLOWS; LEGUMES"	Livestock and crops are key components of mixed farming systems and are a source of household food and income. However, mixed farming systems face livestock feed shortages and low soil productivity challenges. Conservation agriculture (CA) systems based on minimum soil disturbance, crop residue retention and crop rotations offer an opportunity to grow both fodder and food crops on the available land to improve productivity and crop output per-unit area. A four-year experiment involving maize monocropping as control treatment and four relay or intercropping treatments with different legume and fodder crops was set up on contrasting soils in Zimbabwe. Lablab was superior in biomass production compared with radish on both soil types. On the clay soil, continuous maize, sole lablab, sole radish, maize/lablab relay and radish/common beans relay treatments produced similar biomass when soil moisture was adequate. When soil moisture was limiting, lablab produced more biomass than continuous maize, radish, maize/lablab relay and radish/beans relay treatments on clay soil. On sandy soils, lablab produced more biomass than continuous maize, radish, maize/lablab relay and radish/beans relay treatments. Leguminous and non-leguminous fodder crops can be grown successfully in CA systems that are being promoted in the mixed crop/livestock farming systems of southern Africa.

J	"Dovie, DBK; Witkowski, ETF; Shackleton, CM"				"Dovie, DBK; Witkowski, ETF; Shackleton, CM"			Direct-use value of smallholder crop production in a semi-arid rural South African village	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						"direct-use value; food security; livelihoods; mixed cropping; smallholder farms"	POVERTY	The monetary value of natural resources used by rural communities for subsistence is important when addressing issues affecting the livelihoods of impoverished rural households. There is therefore the need to attribute monetary values to non-marketed products from smallholder production systems in order to reliably account for resource availability and usage to further sound policy decisions. The objective of this paper is to present an empirical analysis of the direct-use and traded values of crop production by households, and to discuss the implications for policy development. The study was undertaken in combination with an evaluation of other livelihood sectors in Thorndale, a semi-arid rural village in the Limpopo province of South Africa. The net direct-use value of crops was estimated at $443.4 per household per annum across the village. Maize (Zea mays), watermelon (Citrullus, vulgaris), peanuts (Arachis hypogaea) and common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) contributed over 90% to the total direct-use value of crops. Maize alone contributed 40% of this value per household at an estimated $652/ha. Marketing of resources was not a common practice, limited to only maize and peanuts. Farming was basically a rain-fed-mixed cropping system with low production inputs. Farmer support services, human capital development and tenure security were major areas identified for policy development. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

We hypothesized that intercropping alleviates the inhibitory effect of N fertilization on nodulation and N-2 fixation of legumes. Two years of field experiments (2006-2007) with different N-fertilizer rates (0, 75, 150, 225, 300 kg N ha(-1)) were carried out to test the hypothesis in a faba bean (Vicia faba L.)/maize (Zea mays L.) intercropping system in the north-western part of China. The results show that both the nodule biomass and nitrogen derived from the atmosphere (Ndfa) in intercropped faba bean were increased by 7-58% and 8-33% at the start of flowering, 8-72% and 54-61% at peak flowering, 4-73% and 18-50% at grain filling, and 7-62% and -7-72% at maturity, respectively, compared with sole faba bean. Intercropping with maize significantly alleviated the inhibitory effect of N fertilization on nodulation and N-2 fixation, and improved the productivity of intercropping.

We examined the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in responses to different P forms [Ca-10(OH)(2)(PO4)(6) (Ca-P), sodium phytate (Na-P), and KH2PO4 (K-P)] in coix (Coix lacryma-jobi L.)/faba bean (Vicia faba L.) intercropping systems. Shoot biomass of coix was significantly affected by P forms but not for faba bean. The Na-P and K-P treatments significantly enhanced shoot P concentration of coix with AMF inoculation conditions, however, Na-P and K-P treatments significantly enhanced the shoot P concentration of faba bean without AMF inoculation conditions. Monoculture faba bean had greater concentrations of malate and citrate and lower pH values than in intercropping, and than in monoculture coix. The growth of intercropped coix was promoted by the neighboring faba bean. We conclude that the difference utilized strategies in P forms of coix and faba bean, which improved intercropping productivity. Core Ideas Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi inoculation enhanced biomass and P uptake of coix and faba bean. The presence of faba bean facilitated the growth of neighboring coix. Difference utilized strategies in P forms of coix and faba bean improved intercropping productivity.

The experimental design was a randomised complete block design with eight treatments replicated four times. Significant differences were observed in total plant dry weight by the different treatments in pure stands. 21 days after emergence with higher values under mixed cropping system in common beans. However, at 42 days after emergence, plant dry weights in uninoculated common bean pure stands with N application were significantly higher than under other treatments. Common bean yields were significantly reduced by the maize intercrop. The inoculated common bean and N application treatment recorded the largest seed dry weights and subsequently yields per hectare. These findings suggest that intercropping common beans and maize considerably suppresses the yield of the former under the semi-arid conditions of south-east Kenya. Inoculation of common bean with the commercially available Rhizobium strain 446 on the other hand was effective and improved yields. Soil analysis of the experimental plots before and after one cropping season indicated that common beans increased N slightly or maintained it at the pre-planting levels. This was unlike the pure maize plots where there was a marked decline in soil N. There was however, a marked increase in soil phosphorus in all treatment plots. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, there are very few published studies on long-term changes in soil chemical and biological properties in intercropping systems compared to sole cropping. Methods A field experiment was established in 2003 in Gansu province, northwest China. The treatments comprised three intercropping systems (either continuous or rotational wheat/maize, wheat/faba bean, maize/faba bean intercropping), rotational cropping (wheat-maize, wheat-faba bean, faba bean-maize, and wheat-maize-faba bean rotations), and monocropping (sole wheat, faba bean and maize) systems. In 2011 (ninth year of the experiment) and 2012 (tenth year) the yields and some soil chemical and biological properties were examined after all crop species were harvested. Results There was overyielding by 6.6 % and 32.4 % in wheat/maize intercropping in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Faba bean/maize intercropping was enhanced by 34.7 % and 28.6 %, respectively but not wheat/faba bean intercropping. Soil organic matter, total nitrogen, Olsen P, exchangeable K and cation exchange capacity in all intercropping systems did not differ from the monocultures except for soil pH in wheat/maize and faba bean/maize intercropping in 2011 and soil exchangeable K and cation exchange capacity (CEC) in 2012. Soil pH in wheat/maize and faba bean/maize intercropping was significantly reduced by 3.2 % and 1.9 %, respectively. Soil exchangeable K in wheat/maize, faba bean/maize and wheat/faba bean intercropping declined markedly by 15 %, 21.7 % and 12.1 %, respectively. Soil cation exchange capacity in wheat/maize, faba bean/maize and wheat/faba bean intercropping was notably lower than the corresponding monocultures by 17.5 %, 23.3 % and 18.3 %, respectively. Soil enzyme activities after 9 and 10 years of intercropping differed little from monocultures or rotations. Conclusions The results indicate that intercropping overyielded compared with monocropping or rotational cropping and also maintained the stability of most of the soil chemical and enzyme activities relative to rotations and monocropping in the relatively fertile soil studied.

We tested whether (i) intercropping with faba bean can improve N status of rapeseed, and (ii) root complementarity and/or N transfer is involved in such performance. Pre-germinated rapeseed and faba bean were grown either together or in monospecific rhizotrons (2 plants per rhizotron). Root growth was recorded. N rhizodeposition of the crops and N transferred between species were assessed using a N-15 stem-labelling method. Intercropped rapeseeds accumulated 20 % higher amounts of N per plant than monocultures. Up to 32 days after sowing, root distribution in the rhizotrons was favourable to physical sharing of the soil N: 64 % of faba bean root length was located in the upper part, as 70 % was in the lower part for rapeseed. At late flowering of the faba bean (52 days after sowing), N rhizodeposition of the two crops were similar and reached 8 to 9 % of the plant N. N transferred from the faba bean to the rapeseed was similar to that transferred from the rapeseed to the faba bean. Niche complementarity benefits more intercropped rapeseed than net N fluxes between species in the early growth.

The cereal leafminer, Syringopais temperatella (Lepidoptera, Scythrididae) is a major biotic constraint to wheat and barley production in Jordan and the region. Three variables of yield components were used to quantify the loss of wheat and barley including the grain yield, straw dry mass and leaf area consumed. Forty-two (in the field experiment) and one hundred eighteen (in the laboratory experiment) accessions of wheat and barley were used to access the average damage; representing different levels of susceptibility to S. temperatella. Equations of three negative correlations of percentage of infestation versus both grain yield and straw dry mass, and the number of larvae versus the straw dry mass were produced. Results indicated that the average grain yield reduction for both crops due to pest infestation was estimated at 36.1% for wheat and 50% for barley, but the individual reductions ranged 17.4-73.3%. The straw dry mass reduction was estimated at 29.9% for wheat and 16.5% for barley with individual reductions ranging between 8.4 and 44.8%. In addition, one positive correlation for the number of leafminer larvae versus the leaf area consumed was found.

We designed a hydroponic pot experiment to study the effects of exogenous SA on the occurrence of Fusarium wilt, seedling growth, physiological resistance of faba bean and pathogenicity of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. fabae (FOF). The results showed that SA significantly increased the incidence and disease index of faba bean Fusarium wilt, inhibited the growth of seedlings and reduced the physiological resistance of faba bean. An in vitro study of FOF found that SA increased the ability of the organism to produce fusaric acid, cellulase and pectinase, which increased the susceptibility of faba bean to Fusarium wilt. Interestingly, co-cultivation with wheat significantly reduced the content of SA in exudates from the faba bean roots, which directly reduced the deleterious effects of SA. In addition, co-cultivation could increase the activity of peroxidase and catalase, reduce the content of malondialdehyde, thus improving the ability of faba bean to defend itself. In conclusion, we found that SA, as an autotoxic substance, aggravates the occurrence of Fusarium wilt on faba bean and affects the growth of this crop. However, co-cultivation of faba bean with wheat could alleviate this autotoxicity. This study has discovered a possible mechanism that could explain how co-cultivation can alleviate the obstacles in cropping systems and control Fusarium wilt.

J	"Tosti, G; Guiducci, M"				"Tosti, Giacomo; Guiducci, Marcello"			Durum wheat-faba bean temporary intercropping: Effects on nitrogen supply and wheat quality	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"Cereal-legume intercropping; Competition; Organic farming; N nutrition; SPAD; Solar radiation"	"PEA-BARLEY INTERCROPS; MINOLTA SPAD METER; MEDITERRANEAN ENVIRONMENT; YIELD COMPONENTS; WINTER-WHEAT; N-2 FIXATION; BREAD WHEAT; GRAIN; SYSTEMS; SOIL"	Intercropping cereals and grain legumes is a common practice because of the advantages in N use, in pest and volunteer plant smothering, but when the grains need to be separated, there are several technical difficulties. These problems may be overcome by adopting a particular form of intercropping (termed temporary intercropping) where the coexistence of the crops is limited to a portion of their life cycles. In a cereal-legume temporary row-intercropping, the legume component is ploughed into the soil before cereal shooting: thus the legume is used with a mere fertility purpose in order to improve N availability for the cereal component. The presence of such a positive effect, already confirmed in permanent intercropping, needs to be verified in temporary intercropping systems. In an organic farming system, a field experiment was carried out in two consecutive years (2005 and 2006) to evaluate the technical feasibility of a temporary intercropping between three varieties of durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) and faba bean (Vicia faba L var. minor Beck.) and to test the effects on interspecific competition for light, N availability, cereal grain yield and quality. The species were temporarily intercropped following an additive design, and there was no fertilisation or crop protection. The N incorporated into the soil by the faba bean biomass was rather stable across years. The competitive effect of the legume reduced the biomass accumulation of the intercropped wheat, but the cereal N status was considerably improved. After the faba bean incorporation into the soil, the marked asymmetry of the temporary intercropped wheat (i.e. large inter-row space coupled with high plant density in the row) affected the radiation balance, nevertheless the yield was positively affected and the wheat grain protein content was increased to an excellent (from 12.0 to 13.9% in 2005) or a good (from 10.2 to 11.5% in 2006) level. Temporary intercropping was shown to be excellent method to improve the quality of organic durum wheat in the Mediterranean environmental conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Boy. All rights reserved.

More ecologically sustainable cropping methods are urgently needed to preserve pollinators and to maintain future crop yields. This study examined the impact of strip intercropping on pollinators of spring turnip rape and faba bean. The pollinator abundance, species diversity, and species assemblages in monoculture and intercropping treatments were compared in a two-year field experiment in 2019-2020. Pan traps and transect counts were used to sample pollinators.Transect counts showed the highest pollinator abundance in turnip rape monoculture, medium in intercropping, and the lowest in faba bean monoculture. Pan traps indicated no difference in pollinator abundance among treatments but revealed increasing abundance and species diversity during the flowering season. Temporal change in species assemblage was also detected. Each treatment had distinct pollinator assemblage despite explicit honeybee dominance. All the most common pollinator species were present in the intercropping treatment, but there was no treatment impact on rare species. The rarefied species pool in the intercropping treatment exceeded that of monocultures but pollinator species richness did not differ among the treatments. Pollinator species diversity and evenness were higher in faba bean monoculture than in turnip rape monoculture, but neither had a pairwise difference with the intercropping treatment. Intercropping partially succeeded in substituting abundant turnip rape pollinators with more specialized faba bean pollinators. This resulted in a pollinator species assemblage with a broader range of foraging traits and more even abundance distribution compared with that in pure stands. At the landscape scale, such a shift would potentially improve ecological sustainability by reducing pollinator shortages, preventing pollinator dilution, and interfering less with natural plant pollination. However, rare pollinator species and landscape-level species diversity of pollinators must be supported with additional complementary methods.

Faba bean (Vicia faba L.), oat (Avena sativa L.) and triticale (xTriticosecale Wittmack) sole crops as well as the intercrops of faba bean with each of the above cereals, in three seeding ratios (75:25, 50:50 and 25:75), were compared for dry-matter (DM) yield, nitrogen (N) concentration, chlorophyll content, growth rate and plant height in a 2-year field experiment. Triticale sole crop and faba bean intercrops with triticale provided higher DM yield than faba bean sole crop and the intercrops of faba bean with oat. Growth rates of faba bean, oat and triticale in mixtures were lower than those in sole crops. Faba bean plants were taller in the intercrops than in the sole crop at 3 weeks after tillering (WAT), whereas at 6 WAT, the trend was different as faba bean plants in the sole crop were taller than in the intercrops. N concentration was higher for the cereals when faba bean was included in the mixture. Crude protein (CP) concentration was the highest in faba bean sole crop followed by the faba bean intercrops with oat. However, triticale sole crop and faba bean mixtures with triticale provided higher CP yield than all other crops because of their highest DM yield. Thus, mixtures of faba beans with triticale could be a promising alternative for increased forage production because of their capacity for high DM and protein yields.	"[Dordas, C.

A field experiment was conducted to investigate the relationship between root distribution and interspecific interactions between intercropped plants. Roots were sampled twice by auger and twice by the monolith method in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/maize (Zea mays L.) and faba bean (Vicia faba L.)/maize intercropping and in sole wheat, maize, and faba bean up to 100 cm depth in the soil profile. The results showed that the roots of intercropped wheat spread under maize plants, and had much greater root length density (RLD) at all soil depths than sole wheat. The roots of maize intercropped with wheat were limited laterally, but had a greater RLD than sole-cropped maize. The RLD of maize intercropped with faba bean at different soil depths was influenced by intercropping to a smaller extent compared to maize intercropped with wheat. Faba bean had a relatively shallow root distribution, and the roots of intercropped maize spread underneath them. The results support the hypotheses that the overyielding of species showing benefit in the asymmetric interspecific facilitation results from greater lateral deployment of roots and increased RLD, and that compatibility of the spatial root distribution of intercropped species contributes to symmetric interspecific facilitation in the faba bean/maize intercropping.

Intercropping faba beans (Vicia faba L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) result in overyielding and also, enhanced nodulation by faba beans. By using permeable and impermeable root barriers in a 2-y field experiment, we show that root-root interactions between faba bean and maize significantly increase both nodulation and symbiotic N-2 fixation in intercropped faba bean. Furthermore, root exudates from maize promote faba bean nodulation, whereas root exudates from wheat and barley do not. Thus, a decline of soil nitrate concentrations caused by intercropped cereals is not the sole mechanism for maize promoting faba bean nodulation. Intercropped maize also caused a twofold increase in exudation of flavonoids (signaling compounds for rhizobia) in the systems. Roots of faba bean treated with maize root exudates exhibited an immediate 11-fold increase in the expression of chalcone-flavanone isomerase (involved in flavonoid synthesis) gene together with a significantly increased expression of genes mediating nodulation and auxin response. After 35 d, faba beans treated with maize root exudate continued to show up-regulation of key nodulation genes, such as early nodulin 93 (ENOD93), and promoted nitrogen fixation. Our results reveal a mechanism for how intercropped maize promotes nitrogen fixation of faba bean, where maize root exudates promote flavonoid synthesis in faba bean, increase nodulation, and stimulate nitrogen fixation after enhanced gene expression. These results indicate facilitative root-root interactions and provide a mechanism for a positive relationship between species diversity and ecosystem productivity.

J	"Jensen, ES; Peoples, MB; Hauggaard-Nielsen, H"				"Jensen, Erik S.; Peoples, Mark B.; Hauggaard-Nielsen, Henrik"			Faba bean in cropping systems	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Review						"Break-crop effect; Crop rotation; Nitrogen dynamics; N-2 fixation; Vicia faba L"	"BIOLOGICAL N-2 FIXATION; FIELD-GROWN CHICKPEA; NITROGEN-FIXATION; GRAIN LEGUMES; VICIA-FABA; POPULATION-DENSITY; CATCH CROPS; SOIL; WHEAT; N-15"	The grain legume (pulse) faba bean (Vicia faba L.) is grown world-wide as a protein source for food and feed. At the same time faba bean offers ecosystem services such as renewable inputs of nitrogen (N) into crops and soil via biological N-2 fixation, and a diversification of cropping systems. Even though the global average grain yield has almost doubled during the past 50 years the total area sown to faba beans has declined by 56% over the same period. The season-to-season fluctuations in grain yield of faba bean and the progressive replacement of traditional farming systems, which utilized legumes to provide N to maintain soil N fertility, with industrialized, largely cereal-based systems that are heavily reliant upon fossil fuels (=N fertilizers, heavy mechanization) are some of the explanations for this decline in importance. Past studies of faba bean in cropping systems have tended to focus on the effect of faba bean as a pre-crop in mainly cereal intensive rotations, whereas similar information on the effect of preceding crops on faba bean is lacking. Faba bean has the highest average reliance on N-2 fixation for growth of the major cool season grain legumes. As a consequence the N benefit for following crops is often high, and several studies have demonstrated substantial savings (up to 100-200 kg N ha(-1)) in the amount of N fertilizer required to maximize the yield of crops grown after faba bean. There is, however, a requirement to evaluate the potential risks of losses of N from the plant-soil system associated with faba bean cropping via nitrate leaching or emissions of N2O to the atmosphere as a consequence of the rapid mineralization of N from its N-rich residues. It is important to develop improved preventive measures, such as catch crops, intercropping, or no-till technologies, in order to provide farmers with strategies to minimize any possible undesirable effects on the environment that might result from their inclusion of faba bean in cropping system. This needs to be combined with research that can lead to a reduction in the current extent of yield variability, so that faba bean may prove to be a key component of future arable cropping systems where declining supplies and high prices of fossil energy are likely to constrain the affordability and use of fertilizers. This will help address the increasing demand by consumers and governments for agriculture to reduce its impact on the environment and climate through new, more sustainable approaches to food production. The aims of this paper are to review the role of faba bean in global plant production systems, the requirements for optimal faba bean production and to highlight the beneficial effects of faba bean in cropping systems.

A map presenting survey points illustrates that collections have occurred repeatedly in the same locations. Observations of these locations reveal that urbanization and industrialization, not high yielding varieties, are displacing traditional varieties. Non-linear principal components analysis was used to assess associations between variables in areas where maize persists. Landraces appear to be associated with mountains and mesas, mixed cropping, little or no access to irrigation and areas classified as having low agricultural capacity; conversely, landraces have more commonly been replaced in areas of high agricultural capacity. The areas of high agriculture capacity, located in the riparian areas and plains, also have been the easiest to develop for urban and industrial use. Increasingly high rates of urbanization and development in areas of high agriculture capacity will impede the conservation of crop diversity in these areas."

In this study, we monitored crop growth with digital cameras installed at four automatic weather observation stations in different parts of China, from 2010 to 2016. With each station having a particular type of crop, nine color vegetation indices were calculated from the acquired time series digital photographs to arrive at an FVC estimation model applicable to sugarcane, maize, cotton and paddy rice. For individual crop types, our results show that the Excess Green (ExG) is the optimal color vegetation index for the estimation of sugarcane FVC, the Normalized Difference Index (NDI) is the optimal color vegetation index for the estimation of maize FVC, and the Vegetative (VEG) color vegetation index is optimal for the FVC estimation of cotton and paddy rice. However, owing to its higher coefficient of determination (R-2), and lower root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.9504, 0.0721 and 0.0545, respectively, the Color Index of Vegetation Extraction (CIVE) is found more universally applicable for FVC estimation of the four crop types under investigation. The CIVE index has therefore been proposed in this study to be optimal for FVC estimation in sugarcane, maize, cotton and paddy rice mixed cropping agro-systems which are especially common in small and highly fragmented agricultural landscapes such as those in urban and peri-urban areas.

Nevertheless, the changes of flavonoids in root exudates in intercropping system are still unknown. Based on pot experiment of faba bean and wheat intercropping, here we showed that faba bean and wheat intercropping increased the nodules number and dry weight, dry weight per nodule of faba bean compared with those found in monocropping, and the increase of faba bean nodulation was likely caused by the enhancement with flavonol, isoflavone, chalcone and hesperetin in its root exudates. It also promoted exudation of five types of flavonoids by wheat compared with monocropping. Our findings suggest that the flavonoids in root exudates have a positive effect on the nodulation and nitrogen fixation of faba bean in faba bean and wheat intercropping.

An alternative to oat may be naked oat (Avena nuda L.), whose oil content and quality is double. Here, intercropping of naked oat with two different faba bean cultivars (determinate-high tannin and indeterminate-low tannin) was compared with sole crops of each species in 2006-2008. The treatments were: sole naked oat at 500 kernels m(2), indeterminate sole faba bean at 50 seeds m(2), determinate sole faba bean at 70 seeds m(2), and an additive series of 25%, 50%, and 75% of faba bean seeding rate mixed with the naked oat seeding rate. Our results demonstrated that intercropping increased the Land Equivalent Ratio by + 3% to + 9% over sole cropping. Raising the faba bean seeding rate in a mixture from 25% to 75% reduced oat grain yield from 630 (determinate cultivar) to 760 kg ha(-1) (indeterminate cultivar) but increased faba bean grain yield from 760 kg ha-1. Higher yield and leaf area index (LAI) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) values show that the indeterminate cultivar of faba bean is more suitable in mixture with naked oat. The high value of competition index (CR > 1) indicates domination and aggressiveness of faba bean towards naked oat. Regardless of cultivar type, mixture of faba bean with naked oat is less productive than pure sowing.

The study uses a South Asia case study as illustration using data from a set of village and household surveys in three different sites. The estimated shadow prices were higher for CR as mulch than for CR as feed at all three sites. These results reject the null hypothesis that the estimated shadow price for CR as feed is greater than the shadow price for CR as mulch.

J	Andy, ON				Andy, Okpoho Nkweamaowo			Smallholder agriculture land use impact on soil organic carbon stock in Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						"Soil organic carbon stock; climate change; smallholder agriculture land use; Nigeria; Savanna zone"	"SEQUESTRATION; CLIMATE; MANAGEMENT; EMISSIONS"	Smallholder agriculture land use systems have profoundly influenced soil organic carbon stock. The study was conducted in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) of Nigeria, located in the Southern Guinea Savanna zone. The aim was to determine the effect of smallholder agriculture land use on soil organic carbon stock. Cashew plantation, sole maize farm and maize-cowpea mixed cropping farm were studied. The soil samples were collected randomly using an auger at 0 to 20 cm depth from the farms in all the six Area Councils (Abuja Municipal, Kuje, Bwari, Kwali, Gwagwalada and Abaji) of Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Composite samples of 48 in number were taken to represent each land use type, making it a total of 144 composite soil samples. The soil samples were taken to the laboratory for analysis and computations. Results were subjected to statistical analysis. Cashew plantation significantly had the highest soil organic carbon stock (24.84 +/- 0.225 t ha-1) followed by maize-cowpea mixed cropping farm (21.98 +/- 0.283 t ha-1) and sole maize farm recorded the lowest (13.87 +/- 0.089 t ha-1). The significant difference in soil carbon stock among cashew plantation, maize-cowpea and maize farm may be due to the differences in overall soil management practice and cropping system. Residue removal, soil erosion, intensive tillage, low rate of biomass production, low carbon input and high rate of mineralization are the factors that contributed to lower soil organic carbon stock in maize farms compared to cashew plantation. In the savanna zone of Nigeria, maize farms are subjected to continuous and intensified cultivation, coupled with no return of crop residues. The decline in soil organic carbon stock under sole maize cultivation compared to maize-cowpea suggests degradation of the soils for sustainable crop production exacerbated by climate change in the savanna. However, the maintenance of soil carbon stock and soil productivity in maize farms under continuous cultivation and changing climate could be possible by combining maize with legume plus adequate soil management practices.

J	Kohler-Schneider, M				Kohler-Schneider, M			Contents of a storage pit from late Bronze Age Stillfried, Austria: another record of the new glume wheat	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY			English	Article						"archaeobotany; Triticum dicoccum; Triticum timopheevi; morphology; identification"		Since Jones et al. (2000) drew attention to a 'new' type of glume wheat from Neolithic and Bronze Age sites in northern Greece, several finds of this morphologically distinct tetraploid wheat form have been made across central and southeastern Europe. Charred remains of this wheat, dating from 819-1031 cal B.C., have also been discovered in a storage pit at late Bronze Age Stillfried, eastern Austria. As both chaff and grains were found, it was not only possible to match the diagnostic features of the spikelet bases to the 'new' form, but also to examine the grains, which are strikingly long, slender and flat. A dorsal ridge is absent and there is no hump above the embryo. The embryo angle is relatively low and compression lines are much more distinct. Within the Stillfried store 'new' glume wheat grains were also easily separable from two-grained einkorn and spelt grains. The morphology of the grains is not inconsistent with the suggestion that the 'new' type glume wheat might correspond to modern Triticum timopheevi. In Stillfried 'new' glume wheat was grown as a winter crop, and it seems to have been cultivated as a maslin (mixed crop) together with T. monococcum (einkorn).

These augment the demand for agricultural products and have led to the expansion, intensification, and often closer integration of crop and livestock production systems. The transition of crop and livestock production from the current relatively extensive, low input/output modes of production to more intensive, higher input/output modes of production presents numerous challenges to the achievement of required long-term production increases from these farming systems. This paper provides an overview of the challenges facing agricultural production in semiarid SSA with a focus on West Africa. A description of mixed crop-livestock farming systems and their evolution is followed by an overview of the principal linkages between crops and livestock: income, animal power, feed, and manure. The most detailed discussions relate to nutrient cycling in these farming systems. Most livestock derive their feed almost exclusively from natural rangeland and crop residues, and livestock manure is a precious soil fertility amendment. However, most farmers have insufficient livestock and therefore manure to sustain food production. Nutrient harvests from cropland often exceed nutrient inputs, and soil nutrient depletion is a principal concern. The paper concludes with a discussion of strategies that may improve the productive capacity of these mixed farming systems.

This study examined the economic performance and relative riskiness of monoculture cereal, cereal-oilseed, and cereal-oilseed-pulse rotations, each managed under conventional-, minimum-, and zero-tillage practices over a 12-year period (1987-1998) in the sub-humid Black soil zone of Saskatchewan. These crop rotations included: spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-spring wheat-winter wheat (T aestivum L.)-fallow (Ws-Ws-Ww-F), spring wheat-spring wheat-flax (Linum usitatissimum L.)-winter wheat (Ws-Ws-Fx-Ww), and spring wheat-flax-winter wheat-field pea (Pisum sativum L.) (Ws-Fx-Ww-P). Annual production costs for the complete rotation systems increased with cropping intensity and cropping diversity (monoculture cereal ($ 249 ha(-1)) < cereal-oilseed ($ 304 ha(-1)) < cereal-oilseed-pulse ($ 310 ha(-1))); however, costs were not affected by tillage method. The savings in labor, fuel, repair and machinery overhead with minimum- and zero-tillage practices (compared with conventional-tillage) were generally offset by increased expenditures for herbicides. For most grain price scenarios examined, gross returns and net returns were generally highest for Ws-Fx-Ww-P, intermediate for Ws-Ws-Fx-Ww ($ 7-33 ha(-1) lower), and lowest for Ws-Ws-Ww-F ($ 35-70 ha(-1) lower). Within the mixed rotations, economic returns tended to be higher when managed using minimum- and zero-tillage practices (compared to conventional-tillage), reflecting the higher grain yields they produced. Income variability, or degree of riskiness, was lowest for conservation tillage and the mixed cropping systems. Our findings explain the recent changes in land use practices that have been adopted by most producers in this region. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

Biochemical, functional and molecular characterization of pigeon pea rhizobia isolated from semi-arid regions of India	ARCHIVES OF MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						"Indigenous pigeon pea rhizobia; Biochemical and molecular characterization; Plant growth promoting (PGP) activities; In vitro symbiotic efficacy"	"CAJANUS-CAJAN; GENETIC DIVERSITY; GROWTH; BRADYRHIZOBIUM; NODULATION; ALIGNMENT; NITROGEN; STRAINS; LEGUMES; NODULES"	Pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millspaugh) is among the top ten legumes grown globally not only having high tolerance to environmental stresses along, but also has the high biomass and productivity with optimal nutritional profiles. In the present study, 55 isolates of rhizobia were identified from 22 nodule samples of pigeon pea collected from semi-arid regions of India on the basis of morphological, biochemical, plant growth promoting activities and their ability to tolerate the stress conditions viz. pH, salt, temperature and drought stress. Amongst all the 55 isolates, 37 isolates showed effective nodulation under in vitro conditions in pigeon pea. Further, five isolates having multiple PGP activities and high in vitro symbiotic efficiency were subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing and confirmed their identities as Rhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Sinorhizobium sp. Further these 37 isolates were characterized at molecular level using ARDRA and revealed significant molecular diversity. Based on UPGMA clustering analysis, these isolates showed significant molecular diversity. The high degree of molecular diversity is due to mixed cropping of legumes in the region. The assessment of genetic diversity and molecular characterization of novel strains is a very important tool for the replacement of ineffective rhizobial strains with the efficient strains for the improvement in the nodulation and pigeon pea quality. The pigeon pea isolates with multiple PGPR activities could be further used for commercial production.

Diversity in crop residue management across an intensification gradient in southern Africa: System dynamics and crop productivity	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Maize production; Crop-livestock systems; Extensification; Smallholder farms; Farm diversity"	"SMALLHOLDER FARMING SYSTEMS; SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER; CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; TRADE-OFFS; FERTILITY; RESOURCE; FARMERS; MANURE; KEY; TEMPERATURE"	"Crop residues are important for livestock feed and nutrient cycling among many other functions on smallholder farming systems of sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this study was to assess differences in resource endowment, crop productivity and crop residue management in selected sites in southern Africa. Three sites were selected along a gradient of intensification of crop production; Murehwa, Zimbabwe and Ruaca and Gorongosa, central Mozambique. Murehwa and Ruaca have mixed crop-livestock systems with more intensive crop production in Murehwa. Gorongosa is predominantly crop based with small livestock that do not impact on crop production. A combination of land size and cattle ownership was the major attribute that defined wealth status among farmers in mixed crop-livestock systems whereas land size and labor availability were important under crop-based extensification systems. Farm systems were more diverse where livestock was more important. The wealthiest farmers (resource group RGI) in Murehwa produced an average of 2.2 t ha(-1) maize crop residues, and productivity decreased with decrease in resource ownership with the poorest (RG4) achieving only 0.8 t ha(-1). In Ruaca 1.3 and 0.5 t ha(-1) was produced by RG1 and RG4 respectively, whereas in Gorongosa 0.4 and 0.2 t ha-1 was produced by RG1 and RG4. These crop residues are insufficient to achieve the minimum threshold of soil cover (30%) required for the practice of conservation agriculture. However, they can provide sufficient feed to sustain livestock of RG1 farmers in Murehwa for 63 days and 54 days for RG2 farmers. In Ruaca, they can feed cattle for 37 days for RGI and 17 days for RG2 farmers. The product of livestock x population density determined the extent and manner in which crop residues are used. The population density limited the extent of the grazing area, increased grazing frequency and reduced the grazing quality leading to the need to supplement animal feed with crop residues. Farmers preferentially allocate crop residues to livestock where labor is available. The crop residues fed to animals allow farmers to increase manure quantity and quality which explains the major differences in crop productivity between the different resource groups. In the absence of cattle, crop residues are burned before the cropping season to facilitate land clearance. In conclusion, land size, cattle ownership and labor availability largely define the intensity of crop production and the fate of crop residues on smallholder farms in southern Africa.

Soil seed density of Striga varied among farmers' fields between 0 and more than 80000 seed m(-2). Differences among fields were mainly due to cropping history. The number of emerged, surviving and reproducing Striga plants were analyzed on maize and sorghum and showed a large variability among fields. Differences among fields were larger for maize than for sorghum and were mainly due to differences in crop management practices being used by farmers. The number of newly produced Striga seed at the end of the season varied between 0 and 109,000 seed m(-2) and proved to be largely independent of the initial soil seed bank. Large differences were found in the contribution of sorghum and maize in mixed cropping systems to the overall reproduction of Striga. Sorghum is the major host for Striga reproduction. In an area with intensified maize-cropping, maize functions as a Striga-suppressive crop while in an area with extensive crop management maize contributes significantly to Striga reproduction. The analysis of the population dynamics of the parasite shows the importance of a farming systems approach to pest management and to the development of sustainable cropping systems for the savannas.

In the present study, the effects of different turnip rape (Brassica rapa) cultivation treatments on the soil fungal community were investigated in two experiments in 2009 2010 and 2010 2011. The treatments used turnip rape as a green manure, as a mixed-crop with barley, or as a rotational crop after barley, with continuous barley as the reference. The composition of the soil fungal community was monitored with capillary-based length heterogeneity PCR using primers ITS1F/ITS4. The operational taxonomic units (OTUs) identified as the pathogens Botrytis cinerea, Rhizoctonia solani and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum did not respond to different treatments. Fungal diversity was the lowest and the relative abundance of Fusarium spp. the highest in barley monoculture. Incorporation of turnip rape plants into the soil as green manure was associated with a low relative abundance of Fusarium spp. Turnip rape as a mixed crop or rotational crop did not substantially decrease the relative abundance of Fusarium spp. Aqueous and non-polar extracts of allelochemicals from turnip rape had very little effect on the growth of Fusarium culmorum in vitro. We conclude that high fungal diversity, resulting from either application of fertilizer or incorporation of organic matter of turnip rape, was more important than allelochemicals in affecting the growth of Fusarium spp. in field soils.

Merrill, and in additive mixtures of soybean with dwarf or tall isolines of sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench. Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch) colonized sorghum whorls and was the major species caught in pan traps. Weekly aphicide spot applications to sorghum whorls, starting at 36 d after planting, did not suppress R. maidis colonies significantly until after the third application. Landing rates of R. maidis alatae were similar in treated and untreated crop mixtures. The lack of a significant difference may have resulted from immigration of R. maidis alatae from outside the experimental field but inefficient colony suppression may have produced similar results. Mixed cropping reduced landing rates of Aphis gossypii Glover, Aphis helianthi complex, and Lipaphis erysimi (Kaltenbach) on sorghum plants, and R. maidis on soybean plants. Generally, landing rates were equally reduced in the mixtures with tall or dwarf sorghum. The percentage of ground covered by vegetation, which was less in monocultures than in mixtures, proved to be more important than crop height in reducing aphid landing rates. All aphid species landed randomly on soybean and sorghum plants within dwarf sorghum mixtures. However, in tall sorghum mixtures Aphis nerii Boyer de Fonscolombe and A. gossypii preferred to land on soybean whereas Aphis spiraecola Patch landed more often on sorghum. Landing R. maidis alatae did not show a preference for sorghum or soybean in the crop mixtures. Different sensitivities to microclimatic conditions may explain these behavioral patterns.

Long-term field experiments were started in 2003 to study the effects of intercropping on crop N use and soil mineral N accumulation in wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv 2014)/maize (Zea mays L. cv Shendan16), wheat/faba bean (Vicia faba L. cv Lincan No. 5) and maize/faba bean intercropping and monocropping systems. Monocropping was compared with two types of strip intercropping: continuous intercropping (two crops intercropped continuously on the same strips of land every year) and rotational intercropping (two crops grown adjacently and rotated to the other crop's strip every year). Maize/faba bean intercropping had greater crop N uptake than did wheat/faba bean or wheat/maize. Wheat/maize accumulated more mineral N in the top 140 cm of the soil profile during the co-growth stage from maize emergence to maturity of wheat or faba bean. Continuously intercropped maize substantially decreased soil mineral N accumulation under wheat and faba bean rows (60-100 cm soil depth) at maize harvest. Soil mineral N accumulation under wheat rows increased with rotational intercropping with faba bean. Rotational intercropping may potentially alleviate the adverse effects of wheat on N use by other crops and increase the nitrogen harvest index of wheat, maize and faba bean. Intercropping using species with different maturity dates may be more effective in increasing crop N use efficiency and decreasing soil mineral N accumulation.

One of each pair was under conventional agriculture and the other under an alternative (organic or biodynamic) system. In the study locality, a mixed cropping system of farming is practised in which grazed grass/white clover pastures and/or grass and white clover seed crops are grown in rotation with arable crops. The energy input for sheep meat production was appreciably lower than that normally observed in intensive production in the Northern Hemisphere. This is principally because livestock graze outside throughout the year on forage that has been supplied with little energy-intensive fertiliser-N. Energy input was lower under alternative than conventional sheep meat production at two of the sites and similar at the third. For cereal crops (wheat and barley), energy inputs and grain yields were greater under conventional than alternative management owing mainly to fertiliser-N inputs under conventional management. These accounted for 23-63% of total energy inputs. Sown seeds and field operations contributed substantially to energy inputs under both farming systems. Fertiliser-N inputs under conventional management were low compared with those used in Europe and North America since cereal crops relied partially on N-2 fixed biologically during pasture and seed crop phases of the rotations. As a result, the energy efficiency ratio (energy output over input) was considerably higher than that commonly observed in intensive agriculture in the Northern Hemisphere. The energy efficiency ratio for cereal production was higher under alternative management at two sites but higher under conventional management at another. Over the entire rotation, the mean annual energy input was considerably lower under alternative than conventional management. Labour input was higher for production of individual cereal crops under alternative management but mean annual labour inputs over the whole rotations were slightly lower under alternative than conventional management.

While the importance of plant-plant interactions in explaining overyielding in intercropping is well known, the role of the microbiome, in particular how the presence of microbes from heterospecific crop species inhibit pathogens of the focal plants in affecting yield remains hardly explored. Here we performed both field samplings and pot experiments to investigate the microbial interactions in the maize/faba bean intercropping system, with the focus on the inhibition of Fusarium oxysporum in faba bean plants. Long-term field measurements show that maize/faba bean intercropping increased crop yield, reduced the gene copies of F. oxysporum by 30-84% and increased bacterial richness and Shannon index compared to monocropping. Bacterial networks in intercropping were more stable with more hub nodes than the respective monocultures. Furthermore, the observed changes of whole microbial communities were aligned with differences in the number of siderophore-producing rhizobacteria in maize and pathogen abundances in faba bean. Maize possessed 71% more siderophore-producing rhizobacteria and 33% more synthetases genes abundance of nonribosomal peptides, especially pyochelin, relative to faba bean. This was further evidenced by the increased numbers of siderophore-producing bacteria and decreased gene copies of F. oxysporum in the rhizosphere of intercropped faba bean. Four bacteria (Pseudomonas spp. B004 and B021, Bacillus spp. B005 and B208) from 95 isolates antagonized F. oxysporum f. sp. fabae. In particular, B005, which represented a hub node in the networks, showed particularly high siderophore-producing capabilities. Intercropping increased overall bacterial diversity and network complexity and the abundance of siderophore-producing bacteria, leading to facilitated pathogen suppression and increased resistance of faba bean to F. oxysporum. This study has great agronomic implications as microorganisms might be specifically targeted to optimize intercropping practices in the future.

Using a positive deviance approach to inform farming systems redesign: A case study from Bihar, India	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						"FarmDESIGN model; Multi-objective optimization; Soil organic matter balance; Dietary energy; Mixed crop-livestock systems; Farm typology"	"NORTH-WEST MICHOACAN; CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE; RICE-WHEAT ROTATION; CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; GANGETIC PLAINS; DAIRY FARMS; ECOLOGICAL INTENSIFICATION; MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; NATURAL-RESOURCES; FOOD AVAILABILITY"	Improving farming systems in resource-poor contexts is often difficult as farmers face multiple challenges to implement the innovations developed by researchers. Viable solutions may however be present within local communities by positive deviant farmers, i.e. farmers that outperform positively compared to others. This study develops a positive deviance informed methodology to support redesign of farming systems, with the aim to improve farm productive, economic and environmental performances. We tested the methodology in Bihar, India, using survey data from 43 farms and the indicators of operating profit, soil organic matter balance, water use and dietary energy production. Positive deviant farms and practices were first identified and then recombined into a redesigned farm in consultation with farmers. The FarmDESIGN model was used to calculate current farm performance and to explore potential alternative farm configurations in the redesign. We found that outstanding performance on all indicators could only be reached by integrating high livestock density with an optimal combination of crop practices, which confirms the key role of interactions among components in mixed crop-livestock systems to improve all dimensions of farm sustainability. The redesigns outperformed all real farms on the indicators assessed. Farmers confirmed the viability of the redesigns in focus group discussions and their suggestions can serve as useful input for a next cycle of farm redesign. Since all suggestions are locally practiced and have proven to be accessible, affordable and recognizable, we conclude that our methodology based on positive deviant farms and practices yields promising results with a large potential to boost agricultural development for resource-scarce smallholder farmers.

J	Magnan, N				Magnan, Nicholas			Property rights enforcement and no-till adoption in crop-livestock systems	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						"Common property resources; Crop-livestock farming; No-till; Property rights; Residue; Stubble"	"TECHNOLOGY; AGRICULTURE; MANAGEMENT; EFFICIENCY; MOROCCO; WATER; RISK"	In developing country agriculture property rights over crop residue left on privately farmed land are often poorly enforced, resulting in common grazing. The introduction of no-till agriculture, a technology that presents an alternative use for residue, may sufficiently increase its value so that farmers enforce property rights over this resource. Enforcement of property rights diminishes the amount of common residue available for grazing, and consequently makes the adoption of no-till by other farmers more costly. Using a model of property rights enforcement and technology adoption in a mixed crop-livestock system calibrated with data from Morocco, I demonstrate how one farmer's no-till adoption can prevent other farmers from adopting and present some welfare implications of technology induced property rights enforcement.

Most of the plants were collected from the agricultural drained field (Camellon) in Tlaxcala, Mexico,where farmers do not use pesticides. Maize, beans, squash, alfalfa, faba-bean and vetch are intercropped or rotated in a traditional way. Significant effects of leachates from fresh (10%) vegetative and flowering cultivated plants and weeds were predominantly stimulatory. Among the species tested alfalfa and pinto bean leachates prepared from fresh shoot material were the most stimulatory (29% to 67% and 43% to 75.5% respectively). Aqueous leachates from fresh and dry (1%) cultivated legumes (vegetative and flowering) inhibited weed growth in ranges froth 20% to 43% for fresh material, and 26% to 84% for dry material. In contrast, the aqueous leachates prepared from the dry shoot of most of the plants tested resulted in inhibition of root growth of the test crops (29% to 58%), except to maize. Leachates were also tested on two Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar phaseoli strains. The crop leachates stimulated the growth of both strains except those of P. coccineus var. morado that were inhibitory. Leachates from fresh shoot material of the weeds (Simsia amplexicaulis and Tradescantia crassifolia) significantly inhibited the growth of CPMexl strain, while leachates prepared from fresh root material inhibited the growth of the Tlaxcala strain. In preliminary separation and identification tests using thin layer chromatography (TLC), phenolics were detected in dry shoot material of vegetative alfalfa, pinto bean, and vetch, and flowering faba bean. Results suggest the role of these compounds in the allelopathic effects of these legume aqueous leachates.

Blandus) cv. Aarti caused by Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. gladioli (Massey) Snyd. and Hans. In the field experiment, gladiolus was co-cultivated with 10 agricultural/horticultural crops viz. Allium cepa L., Brassica campestris L., Capsicum annuum L., Eruca sativa Mill., Helianthus annuus L., Tagetes erectus L., Zea mays L., Vinca rosea L. and Rosa indica L., in a soil infested with F. oxysporum. All the crops except V. rosea and R. indica reduced disease incidence. The effect of H. annuus and T. erectus was significant and more pronounced than other co-cultivated crops. In general, root and shoot dry biomass, corm fresh weight, number of cormlets and number of flowers per spike decreased as compared to the un-inoculated monoculture gladiolus treatment (negative control) but these parameters enhanced as compared to the F. oxysporum inoculated monoculture gladiolus treatment (positive control). In a pot experiment, all the crops of the field experiment except V. rosea and R. indica were sown in rotation with gladiolus. Pot grown plants of different species were harvested at maturity and the soil was inoculated with F oxysporum. Gladiolus was cultivated I week after inoculation. Disease incidence was significantly suppressed in all the treatments ranging from 29% to 53%. The highest suppression of disease incidence was recorded in T erectus (53%) followed by B. campestris (49%). The effect of preceding crops on various vegetative parameters was similar in the pot experiment to that of the field experiment. The present study suggests that corm rot disease of gladiolus can be managed by mixed cropping of H. annuus and T erectus or cultivation of T. erectus and B. campestris in rotation.

Extension agents used a participatory research and extension approach (PREA) to encourage farmers to test and adopt ISC technologies. Over a 2-year period, the performance of the technologies was compared with the common farmers' practice with respect to crop yields, Striga seedbank, Striga damage and economics, as well as the adoption and adaptation of ISC technologies among lead farmers and others. ISC improved crop productivity on average by 88%. In the farmers' practice, Striga seedbank increased by 46% in 2 years, while in plots under ISC it was reduced by a similar percentage. ISC resulted in higher margins than the farmers' practice, but increased labour requirements were found to be a limitation for the expansion of the recommended technologies. Improved seed varieties, however, were rapidly adopted by farmers, but often used at lower plant populations than recommended and in mixed cropping systems. It was estimated that the participation of each extension agent resulted in the transfer of knowledge and seed to an average of 240 farmers. In addition, the PREA had improved community, group, and farmer-extension agent relationships. Ongoing demand by Government and NGOs for training in PREA, extension material and improved seed suggested that scaling-up has continued beyond the lifespan of the project. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Intercropping for enhancement and provisioning of ecosystem services in smallholder, rural farming systems in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa: a review	JOURNAL OF CROP IMPROVEMENT			English	Review						"Carbon sequestration; fodder yield; grain yield; interspecific facilitation and complementarity; nitrogen fixation; phosphorus mobilization; soil fertility"	"ZEA-MAYS L.; PHOSPHORUS AVAILABILITY; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; INTERSPECIFIC INTERACTIONS; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; BARLEY CULTIVARS; LABLAB-PURPUREUS; CROPPING SYSTEM; USE EFFICIENCY; CLIMATE-CHANGE"	"Monocropping of maize (Zea mays L.) and communal grazing of livestock (cattle) are the major farming systems for smallholder farmers in the Upper Thukela region of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. However, these farming systems are unable to contribute meaningfully to sustainable food security and viable livelihoods. This is because of continuous declines in crop productivity and soil fertility under monocropping systems and shortages of adequate and good quality forage under communal grazing systems. Although the benefits of intercropping have been well documented, there has been low uptake by small-scale farmers in the temperate, frost-prone communal areas of KwaZulu-Natal. This may be attributed to a lack of research applicable to this region as well as to a lack of understanding of how these systems can address the social and technological challenges faced by these farmers. The latest advances in agroecological farming systems are reviewed here to enable small-scale farmers to better assess the benefits relative to ecosystem services that are compatible with their needs. One such service is the provision of food through nutrient cycling. Available nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are the most limiting nutrients in the soils, which are acidic in nature, of this high-rainfall area of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. This results in poor crop productivity and quality, particularly in smallholder, rural farming systems. High costs of chemical fertilizers, which most smallholder farmers cannot afford, and cropping systems involving monoculture, exacerbate the macro-nutrient deficiency, which leads to low crop yields and quality, feed scarcity, plant pests and diseases, resulting in reduced viable livelihoods and household food insecurity. One option to alleviate the situation is by the use of mixed cropping systems in the form of intercropping, the practice of growing two or more crop species at the same time and in the same place. This review explores, elucidates and summarizes the capability of intercropping to augment agroecosystem services essential for sustainability of smallholder, rural farming systems. The review highlights ways in which intercropping can address the socio-economic needs and aspirations of communities and conserve resources for the benefit of the local environment. Niche differentiation (facilitation and complementarity of resources); soil fertility; crop genetic diversity; management of pests, diseases and weeds; crop production; environmental sustainability and economic viability are discussed, as are the mechanisms underlying provisioning of ecosystem services. We have highlighted that intercropping farming systems considerably improve soil fertility, resource-use efficiency, carbon sequestration, phosphorus uptake and availability, water conservation in soils, crop and fodder productivity and quality and control pests and diseases compared with monoculture farming systems. The other major latest development in mixed-cropping systems is that crop genetic diversity resulting from intercropping contributes in various ways towards reducing incidences of pests and diseases. Technologies and mechanisms that have potential to enhance key ecosystem services for promoting sustainable food systems of rural farmers in KwaZulu-Natal are highlighted."

There is a short season window after the cereal harvestin the Iranian semi-arid regions that remains fallow till the next growing season. The present study was carried out to identify a suitable crop option to use this short period of two months for forage production. Three seeding rates of grass pea were studied inpure stand and as mixture with volunteer crop of barley from shattered seeds. Forage production and quality related traits were evaluated when grass pea reached flowering stage that coincided with the initial creamy stages of barley. The analysis showed that fresh biomass, and calcium and fiber contents were highly significant (P< 0.01). The highest fresh biomass (43 ton/ha) was obtained in the mixture of barley with grass pea at 200 seeds/m(2). The highest fiber content (23.5%) and relatively low ash content (12.6%) were achieved in the mixture of barley with grass pea at 200 seeds/m2. It was concluded that the mixed cropping of barley with grass pea at 200 seeds/m2 was the best combination after barley harvesting using a few irrigations in the semi arid areas.

Disaggregated N2O emission factors in China based on cropping parameters create a robust approach to the IPCC Tier 2 methodology	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"China; Nitrous oxide; Emission factor; Greenhouse gas; Fertilizer; Agriculture"	"NITROUS-OXIDE EMISSIONS; AGRICULTURE; INVENTORY; SOIL"	"China accounts for a third of global nitrogen fertilizer consumption. Under an International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 2 assessment, emission factors (EFs) are developed for the major crop,types using country-specific data. IPCC advises a separate calculation for the direct nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions of rice cultivation from that of cropland and the consideration of the water regime used for irrigation. In this paper we combine these requirements in two independent analyses, using different data quality acceptance thresholds, to determine the influential parameters on emissions with which to disaggregate and create N2O EFs. Across China, the N2O EF for lowland horticulture was slightly higher (between 0.74% and 1.26% of fertilizer applied) than that for upland crops (values ranging between 0.40% and 1.54%), and significantly higher than for rice (values ranging between 0.29% and 0.66% on temporarily drained soils, and between 0.15% and 0.37% on un-drained soils). Higher EFs for rice were associated with longer periods of drained soil and the use of compound fertilizer; lower emissions were associated with the use of urea or acid soils. Higher EFs for upland crops were associated with clay soil, compound fertilizer or maize crops; lower EFs were associated with sandy soil and the use of urea. Variation in emissions for lowland vegetable crops was closely associated with crop type. The two independent analyses in this study produced consistent disaggregated N2O EFs for rice and mixed crops, showing that the use of influential cropping parameters can produce robust EFs for China.

Vegetables are of good nutritional value, and have considerable potential as income-generating crops and as a supplement to diets consisting mainly of carbohydrates. To realize this potential, however, adequate information about the present system of production is essential, as well as improved cultivars and better crop management.

Speer). Very little is known about the effects of below- and aboveground interspecific interactions on wheat nitrogen (N) nutrition and occurrence of wheat powdery mildew. A greenhouse pot experiment examined four N application rates and three belowground partition types (plastic film, nylon mesh partition or no partition) to study N nutrition and interactions between wheat and faba bean growing together. A field experiment investigated three N application rates and growth of wheat in monoculture and intercropped with faba bean with or without belowground plastic film partitions between wheat and faba bean. Disease incidence (DI) and disease severity index (DSI) were assessed at flowering stage and wheat leaves were sampled and analyzed for N. Foliar N was enhanced substantially by N addition in greenhouse and field conditions and also by belowground interactions (no partition compared with plastic film partition) in the pot experiment (all P < 0.001). There was a significant synergistic effect between N rate and belowground interactions on the enhancement of wheat N uptake (P < 0.01) in the pot experiment. DI and DSI of mildew increased markedly with increasing N rate in both experiments (all P < 0.001). In the pot experiment DI and DSI showed no marked differences among belowground partitions (both P > 0.05) but belowground interactions had different effects under different N rates, limiting disease occurrence under 0, 0.1 and 0.2 g N kg(-1) soil but promoting disease with 0.05 g added N kg(-1) soil. In the field experiment DI and DSI showed no significant differences between wheat monoculture and intercropping (both P > 0.05). However, the contributions of below- and aboveground interactions to disease control were different under different N rates, with interspecific root interactions increasing DI and DSI under different N rates and aboveground interactions increasing DI and DSI under zero-N application but decreasing DI and DSI at 150 and 300 kg N ha(-1). The data suggest that the microclimate in the field and biological control mechanisms due to belowground interactions in wheat-faba bean associations may influence the incidence and severity of wheat powdery mildew.

Small-holder ethnic farmers are a vulnerable group in the face of these contaminations. Therefore, this study aimed to clarify the impact of traditional pre-harvest practices on the occurrence of Pusarium verticillioides and fumonisins in maize fields of two Vietnamese small-holder ethnic communities. Sampling along with a questionnaire for the inventory of pre-harvest practices was performed in the Ede (n = 18) and Kinh (n = 13) households from Vietnam between late December 2017 and early January 2019. As a result, the CP888-line fields planted by 39% of the Kinh households accumulated a higher median FB1 level of 987 +/- 843 mu g kg(-1) compared to the NK7328-line fields (0 +/- 5 mu g kg(-1)) planted by 67% of the Ede households (p-value < 0.05). Mono-cropping system (applied by 72% of the Ede and 54% of the Kinh) increased the incidence of FB1 contamination in maize fields by roughly 50% compared to mixed-cropping system. Also, the crop residues-free fields had lower the incidence of FB1 (29%, n = 17) than the fields with crop residues (71%, n = 14). Otherwise, tillage practices, pest management, and irrigation did not affect significantly FB1 contamination in their maize fields.

A hierarchical classification is a classifier that maps input data into defined subsumptive output categories. This classification method can reduce mixed pixel effects and improve classification performance. The methodology are illustrated focus on winter crops in Gimje city, Jeonbuk with Landsat-8 imagery. First, agriculture fields were extracted from Landsat-8 imagery using Smart Farm Map. And then winter crop fields were extracted from agriculture fields using temporal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Finally, winter crop fields were then classified into wheat, barley, IRG, whole crop barley and mixed crop fields using signature from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The results indicate that hierarchical classifier could effectively identify winter crop fields with an overall classification accuracy of 98.99%. Thus, it is expected that the proposed classification method would be effectively used for crop mapping.

Performance of spring cereal genotypes under defoliation on the Eyre Peninsula, South Australia	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE			English	Article						"grain and graze; Zadoks growth scale"	"GROWTH; CROPS; GRAIN; SHEEP"	In mixed cropping and livestock dryland farming systems in southern Australia, grazing of cereals during their vegetative growth stages (typically during winter) can provide a valuable contribution of high-quality feed during a period of low pasture growth. This paper reports results from a series of experiments investigating the impact of defoliation on the grain production of cereals in the Eyre Peninsula region of South Australia. The comparative dry matter production and grain yield of wheat, barley and oats cultivars, with and without defoliation, at a range of growth stages were measured in four experiments over three growing seasons, two of which were water-deficient. The barley varieties evaluated produced up to twice the dry matter of the wheat or oats cultivars to the time of defoliation. Mowing following stem elongation more than halved grain yield (1.9 to 0.9 t ha(-1)) relative to no defoliation in an early-maturing variety, but with less reduction in later maturing varieties. Defoliation before stem elongation in two seasons of very low growing-season rainfall (<100 mm) caused no or very little loss in grain yields, which were generally <1 t ha(-1). A long-season winter wheat produced similar grain yields irrespective of defoliation and timing, but with no yield advantage over the defoliated spring cereals. The results suggest opportunities to incorporate the grazing of cereals to fill a winter feed-gap in the low-rainfall zone of southern Australia.

Borno brown) or sorghum (var. Gooseneck). Damage in the local variety (Ex-borno) of pearl millet sown as a mixed crop with cowpea or sorghum in cropping patterns of 3:1, 2:1, 1:1 and 1:0 was also assessed. Damage and grain yield loss were significantly higher in millet sown on or before 21 July than in those sown later in both 1997 and 1998 cropping seasons; grain yields were, however, significantly higher in millet sown on 14 July or 5 August in 1997 and in millet sown on or before 28 July 1998. Damage and grain yield loss were significantly higher in GB8735 but lower in Gargasori in both years while grain yields were significantly higher in Wame in 1997 and in Gargasori in 1998 than in GB8735. The highest grain yields were obtained from Zongori sown on or before 21 July in 1997 and 1998. Damage and grain yield loss were significantly lower in the millet-sorghum intercrop than in the other cropping systems in 1998; grain yields were significantly higher in sole millet intercrop but lower in millet-sorghum than in the other systems in 1997. Damage and grain yield loss were significantly higher in GB8735 in both years and lower in Gargasori in 1998. The highest grain yields were obtained from sole Zongori in 1997 and Zongori-sorghum intercrop in 1998. Damage was significantly lower in the 1:1 cropping pattern than in the other patterns in 1998. Grain yields were significantly higher in the 1:0 cropping pattern but lower in the 1:1 pattern than in the other patterns in 1997.

Therefore, a parasitoid's oviposition decisions will directly depend on the host, but also on plant quality. Here, we investigated the direct effects of host species and the indirect effects of the host's food plant on the oviposition decisions and performance of the gregarious ectoparasitoidEuplectrus platyhypenaeHoward (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae). With a series of no-choice experiments, we determined the oviposition and performance of the parasitoid on: (1) two caterpillar species, fall armyworm,Spodoptera frugiperdaJE Smith (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and velvet armyworm,Spodoptera latifasciaWalker, reared on maize (Zea maysL., Poaceae), (2) the same caterpillars reared on maize, bean (Phaseolus vulgarisL., Fabaceae), or squash (Cucurbita pepoL., Cucurbitaceae) leaves, and (3)S. latifasciacaterpillars reared on leaves of wild and cultivated lima bean,Phaseolus lunatusL. All these insects and plants originate from Mesoamerica where they have coexisted for thousands of years in the traditional agricultural system known as Milpa in which maize, beans, and squash are planted together. We found that the preferred and best combination of host and host plant for parasitoid performance wasS. frugiperdaon maize. Parasitoids laid larger clutches, had higher survival, and more females and larger adults emerged fromS. frugiperdareared on maize. However, when both caterpillar species were reared on squash,S. latifasciawas the better host. Contrary to the literature,S. frugiperdawas not able to develop on bean plants. Results from the lima bean experiment showed that parasitoid performance was best whenS. latifasciawas reared on leaves of cultivated compared to wild lima bean. These findings are discussed in the context of mixed cropping in which the ability of generalist parasitoids to switch among hosts and host plant species could be advantageous for pest management.

Pure crop of chickpea gave the highest grain yield of 15.90 and 19.72 q/ha during 1987-88 and 1988-89 respectively. Maximum reduction in yield of chickpea was noted in the mixed cropping of mustard [Brassica juncea (L.) Czernj. & Cosson] with chickpea. Intercropping of chickpea + mustard (4 : 1) was more productive and remunerative with 20.16 and 30.25 q/ha grain in chickpea equivalents and with net return Rs 6,015 and 10,301/ha. These net returns were 29.96 and 65.10% higher over net return under pure chickpea respectively. During 1987-88, barley (Hordeum vulgare L. sensu lato) was dominant intercrop with chickpea and was more profitable (Rs 2.73/rupee invested), however during 1988-89 chickpea + mustard (4 : 1) with the profit of Rs 3.74/rupee invested proved more profitable.

Time-series two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) was derived from the 8 day composite 250 m MODIS reflectance data from 2003 to 2016. Using a general cropland mask, the strongest positive linear correlation between crop yields and EVI2 was observed at the end of July to early August, whereas a negative correlation was observed in spring. Using crop-specific masks, the time of the strongest positive linear correlation for winter wheat was found between mid-May and early June, corresponding to peak growth stages of the crop. EVI2 derived at peak growth stages of a crop provided good predictive capability for grain yield estimation, with considerable inter-annual variation. A multiple linear regression model was established for county-level yield estimation using EVI2 at peak growth stages and the year as independent variables. The model accounted for the spatiotemporal variability of grain yields of about 30% and 47% for winter wheat, 63% and 65% for corn, and 59% and 64% for soybean using the general cropland mask and crop-specific masks, respectively. A negative correlation during the spring indicated that vegetation index extracted using a general cropland mask should be used with caution in regions with mixed crops, as factors other than the growth conditions of the targeted crops may also be captured by remote sensing data.

Vetch (Vicia saliva) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) were grown in a mixed culture,and a monoculture system under rainfed conditions in a semi-arid region. Plants were either harvested at 3 sequential times (HI, H2 and H3; 115, 146 and 167 d after planting), or harvested once (H0; 167 d after planting), at physiological maturity. The results indicated that the quality of harvested material declined from the first to the second of the sequential harvests for all cropping systems, with minimal change between the second and third harvests. Material harvested only once at physiological maturity consistently had higher levels of crude fibre and cell wall constituents than material from any of the sequential harvests. In vitro organic matter digestibility and digestible energy values were lower in later harvests than in the first of the sequential harvests. In vitro digestible crude protein (IVDCP) values were consistently higher for vetch than for barley, declining progressively from H1 to H2, H3 and H0 in the case of vetch. With barley, IVDCP values for H3 were significantly higher than for other harvests. A single cut at physiological maturity yielded more digestible energy and protein/ha than serial cuts. The mixed cropping of vetch and barley produced much more forage than barley alone and the quality of the material was much higher than that from barley alone."

Methods Maize and faba bean were planted as either sole crops or intercrops in a P-deficient calcareous soil in cycle 1, and the same cropping systems were added with and without root residues of single or both species in the 2(nd) and 3(rd) cycles in a greenhouse experiment. Biomass and P concentration were determined after each cycle, and soil P fractions were measured after final cycle. Results Addition of a mixture of intercrop root residues increased biomass, total P content, microbial biomass P concentration and soil acid phosphatase activity, compared with addition of root residues of a single crop. Changes in Hedley soil P fractions varied with root residue sources. Sole maize root residue with high C/P ratio caused a considerable depletion of inorganic P (NaHCO3-P-i, NaOH-P-i and 1 M HCl-P-i), and sole faba bean root residue with lower C/P ratio caused a large depletion in Resin-P and NaHCO3-P-o fractions, and the root residue of intercrops with an intermediate C/P ratio depleted more of the NaHCO3-P-o and conc. HCl-P-o fractions. Without adding root residues, sole faba bean depleted more of the Resin-P, NaHCO3-P-i, NaOH-P-i and NaHCO3-P-o fractions than the other two cropping systems did, because it acquired more P from the soil than other crops did. Conclusions Adding a root residue mixture of maize and faba bean accelerated soil organic P mineralization (NaHCO3-P-o and conc. HCl-P-o) by increasing microbial biomass P concentrations and acid phosphatase activities, and thus enhanced the intercropping advantage in terms of biomass and total P content in a P-deficient soil.

In Europe, measures introduced to counteract these losses include those considered agronomically productive, such as organic farming, as well as those that support no direct production of crops, such as non-crop flowering fields in conventional farming systems. We studied biodiversity effects of non-productive flowering fields managed under conventional farming compared to both an organically managed cereal mono-crop (organic winter spelt fields) and a flowering mixed-crop (organic lentil mixed-crop fields) as well as conventionally managed winter wheat fields, which served as control crop. These four crop-use types were studied on six sites over 3 years (17 sites in total) to assess their impact on the activity density (cover for plants), species richness and community composition of wild plants, carabids, spiders, butterflies and wild bees. Species richness of wild plants was highest under organic farming and at field edges when compared to the interior. In the case of carabids and spiders, species richness was highest at the field edges, but there was no difference between the four crop-use types. In contrast, activity density and species richness of butterflies and wild bees responded only to flowering crop-use types, showing no edge effects. Arable land cover in 500 m buffer area also affected community composition of all taxa, with the exception of spiders, but had only minor effects on activity densities and species richness. Synthesis and applications. Our findings underline that there is no single best measure to promote biodiversity on arable land. Instead a mosaic of non-productive and productive measures such as conventional flowering fields, organic crops and field edge habitats might be more appropriate to support the regional species pool in arable-dominated landscapes. To support a range of complementary biodiversity-promoting farming practices, agricultural policy should foster the coordination and collaboration between multiple farmers within the same region by covering additional costs for coordination and prioritizing collaborative schemes.

Despite a variety of ecological benefits and promising grain productivity, applications are scarce among farmers in developed countries. In consideration of MC's potential this study interviews farm managers to profile characteristics of adopters. The transtheoretical model (TTM) is applied to capture adoption and adoption tendencies. The results point to a significant positive role of land owned vs. leased, adoption of reduced tillage and adoption intensity of legumes in general. The perception of technical barriers and the perception of MC's usefulness are also major drivers that proponents need to address. In general, the TTM provides a gradual measure of farmer's willingness to adopt, leading to more variance than binary classifications, which makes TTM especially useful to adoption research of marginalized ecological practices.

The mechanistic model is based on a detailed two-dimensional description of canopies, and solves the energy balance by simulating the distribution of sunlit and shaded leaves. The semi-empirical model refers to an hypothetical 'two-layer' canopy, and simulates the sharing of transpiration using a modified form of the Penman-Monteith equation, including an estimation of the fractional radiation intercepted by each species. Interception of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was predicted with good accuracy by the two models, but differences were observed in the computed fractional intercepted radiation, particularly for the sorghum-dominated crop. Based on the same light interception model, partitioning of maximum transpiration was compared with sap-flow measurements. Transpiration was predicted with relatively good accuracy with the two models when non-limited by soil water conditions. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the semi-empirical model was highly sensitive to uncertainties in the calculated fraction of intercepted radiation, but less sensitive than the mechanistic model to uncertainties in stomatal conductance, vapor pressure deficit, and wind speed. When soil water is limited, coupling separated climatic demand with a suitable soil-root water uptake model is a promising way to predict both transpiration and soil water sharing in mixed crops.

The mean index of moisture adequacy (I(MA)) for the initial two weeks of crop growth was 0.62 and 0.69 in two seasons, which indicated enough moisture during the seedling stage. The crops faced mild drought (mean I(MA) = 0.27 and 0.33) during vegetative phases and severe drought (mean I(MA) = 0.07) during reproductive phases in both seasons. Mixed cropping and row intercropping produced lesser yields than the sole cropping, while strip cropping gave better yields and more risk coverage over sole cropping. A pearl millet-clusterbeam mixture showed superiority over a mixture of pearl millet with greengram or cowpea. Lower yields under row intercropping systems as compared with the sole cropping in drought years was attributed to higher populations in row intercropping. In strip cropping (4:4 rows), both the components produced grain, thereby showing superiority over mixtures and row intercropping. The border rows of strips yielded 12% to 169% higher grain than adjacent inner rows when intercropped with cowpea, greengram, and clusterbean. The pearl millet-greengram strip cropping (4:4) showed the highest land equivalent ratio of 1.26, indicating 26% advantage over sole cropping.

It is a serious threat to maize production and poses a challenge to food and nutrition security. Little is known about its co-occurrence with resident stemborers, relative infestation and damage and how agronomic factors influence its infestation and damage in maize cropping systems across different agro-ecological zones. Maize fields were surveyed across three agro-ecological zones in Kenya. Fall armyworm was found across the three agro-ecological zones and it dominated resident stemborers in maize cropping systems. Its infestations and damage were highest at coastal lowlands compared to mid-altitude and high-altitude lands. Maize grown under mixed cropping systems, with rainfed production and weeded frequently had low infestation and damage compared to those grown under monoculture, with irrigation and no weeding, respectively. Young vegetative maize plants were more infested and damaged compared to mature plants. Different maize varieties were found to have different infestation and damage levels. These results demonstrate dominance of FAW over resident stemborers and that agronomic practices play a role in influencing FAW infestation and damage in maize cropping systems, which need to be considered when designing sustainable pest management solutions. Fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda J.E Smith, (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a serious invasive pest of maize that has been established in Kenya since 2016. Little is known about its co-occurrence with resident stemborers, relative infestation and damage and how agronomic factors influence its infestation and damage in maize cropping systems across different agro-ecological zones. This study assessed FAW co-occurrence with resident stemborers, relative infestation and damage across three agro-ecological zones, and the effects of different agronomic practices on its infestation and damage in maize cropping systems in Kenya. A total of 180 maize farms were surveyed across three different agro-ecological zones. FAW infestation and damage was highest in lowlands compared to mid-altitude and high-altitude lands. Its population (eggs and larvae) dominated that of resident stemborers in maize fields. Maize grown under mixed cropping systems, with rainfed production and weeded frequently had low infestation and damage compared to those grown under monoculture, with irrigation and no weeding, respectively. Young vegetative maize plants were more infested and damaged compared to mature plants. Different maize varieties were found to have different infestation and damage levels with Pioneer having the least damage. These results demonstrate that agronomic practices play a role in influencing FAW infestation and damage in maize cropping systems. Further, the population of FAW is dominating that of stemborers in maize cropping systems in Kenya, four years after its invasion. Thus, agronomic practices need to be considered while designing sustainable agro-ecological-based management solutions for resource-constrained smallholder farmers.

Such information would be useful in developing an integrated approach to managing these two problematic weeds. Field experiments were conducted during 2 yr to evaluate multiple weed species interference of X. strumarium and D. stramonium at the total densities of 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16 plants m-2 (alone, and all possible combinations of the two weeds) with maize. Crop yield was associated with the density of D. stramonium and X. strumarium and decreased severely with increasing weed density. The maximum maize yield loss (63%) occurred when 12 X. strumarium and 4 D. Stramonium plants m-2 were allowed to compete with the crop. The total weed density (expressed in X. strumarium equivalent density) required to cause a 5% maize yield loss was about 0.50 and 0.56 plants m-2 in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Total canopy leaf area index and crop yield were reduced more strongly by competition with X. strumarium than with D. stramonium. Averaged over multispecies populations, X. strumarium contributed 84 and 67% of the total weed biomass in the first and second years, respectively. Owing to the high competitive ability and biomass production of X. strumarium in mixed crop and weed communities, it should be given a greater priority for control than D. stramonium in maize.

JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE			English	Article						"Avena sativa; Pisum sativum; plant competition; relative yield total; symbiotically fixed N-2; yield advantage"	"N-2 FIXATION; COMPETITION; N-15"	On a brown warp soil (Fluventic Eutrochrept) near Goettingen, Germany, conventional leafed pea (Pisum sativum L. cvs Messire and Bohatyr) and semileafless types (cvs Profi. Juno and Azur) were grown in mixed stands together with oat (Avena sativa cvs Alf and Lutz) in substitutively designed experiments from 1995 to 1997. Oat was the dominant component. Crowding coefficients for oat averaged 7.4. No relationship could be detected between the crowding coefficient of oat and any yield advantage from the mixture. Crowding coefficients for pea varied substantially, between 0.1002 (Juno and Alf in 1996) and 0.2979 (Bohatyr and Alf in 1996). Crowding coefficients for semileafless pea cultivars were smaller than for conventional leafed types. The yield advantage of the mixture increased as the crowding coefficient of pea increased. The maximum yield increase for the mixture was achieved when the relative yield total (RYT) = 1.17 or + 11 dt grain DM ha(-1) for mixtures of the long-strawed conventional leafed cultivars Bohatyr and Alf (in 1996). The crowding coefficients of pea were positively correlated with the level of symbiotically fixed N-2 in the mixed stands. When N-2 fixation with mixed cropping was about 30 kg N ha(-1), RYT was unity. Increasing symbiotic N-2 in the mixtures resulted in increasing yield advantages in the mixture. Short-strawed pea cultivars seem unsuitable for mixing with oat. Plant height of pea appeared to be more important than plant leaf type. Accordingly, mixtures containing the long-strawed semileafless pea cultivars Profi and Alf were more successful. It is concluded that increased competitiveness of the pea component in the mixture with oat entails increasing the level of symbiotic N-2 fixation including resource complementarity and thus yield advantage in the mixed stands.

Mixtures of immature grains and protein-rich plants: species choice and placement within rotation	FOURRAGES			French	Article						"Economic aspect; forage; forage crop; forage mixture; forage species; high-protein crop; legume; maslin; self-sufficiency; sowing date; unripe cereals"		Livestock farmers are facing variable and rather discouraging conditions: there are dramatic fluctuations in the prices of protein supplements, meat, and milk as well as in maize silage yield. Consequently, farmers are looking to acquire greater self-sufficiency via new farming regimes and crops. For farmers employing mixed crop-livestock systems, mixtures of immature grains and protein-rich plants can be a tool for increasing feed autonomy and limiting dependence on outside products. The choice of species/varieties will depend on the mixture's placement within the rotation as well as on the desired nutritional value.

For this purpose, two adjacent plots were used during three agronomic years (2011-2012, 2012-2013 and 2013-2014) to evaluate the agronomic performance through the forage production, nutritional composition of forage and silage, and the effects on soil fertility. The Italian ryegrass was cultivated under conventional management: using chemical fertilization and recommended dosages of herbicides. The faba bean-rapeseed intercrop was cultivated under an alternative management: organic fertilization and less herbicide supply. The intercrop provides higher forage yield per hectare than Italian ryegrass, with greater protein (kg ha(-1)) and similar energy (GJ ha(-1)) yields. The intercrop allows reducing the inputs of chemical fertilization and herbicides, and it has a positive effect on the balance of soil nutrients, especially increasing the potassium, calcium and magnesium contents. The results show that faba bean-rapeseed intercrop could be an alternative to the Italian ryegrass as winter crop.

Effect of density, cultivar and irrigation on spring sown monocrops and intercrops of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and faba beans (Vicia faba L.)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"Intercrops; Triticum aestivum L; Vicia faba L; LER RUE"	"FIELD-GROWN DETERMINATE; DIFFERENT WATER REGIMES; PLANT-DENSITY; RESOURCE USE; YIELD; COMPETITION; RADIATION; INTERCEPTION; EFFICIENCY; NITROGEN"	Spring-sown intercrops of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and faba beans (Vicia faba L.) were grown in three experiments at the University of Reading, UK. One wheat cultivar, Axona, and one (experiment 1) or two bean cultivars (experiments 2 and 3) Scirocco and Mans Bead, were grown as sole crops and intercrops at 50%, 75% and 100% recommended density. Experiments were rainfed but irrigation was an additional treatment in experiment 3. Biomass and seed yields of both wheat and faba beans were greater when monocropped than when intercropped. There was no evidence that radiation use efficiency (RUE) of intercrops was significantly different from sole crops. In all intercrops there was no significant effect of density on biomass, RUE or seed yield, though there were compensating changes in yield components. Seed yields of Mans Bead were significantly greater than Scirocco in experiment 3 but not experiment 2. There was no significant effect of irrigation on RUE or on wheat biomass and seed yield, but there was a trend for irrigation to increase faba bean biomass (P=0.07) and seed yield (P=0.06). With later sowing in experiments 2 and 3, time to harvest was shorter and wheat and bean biomass, seed yield and RUE were reduced. All land equivalent ratio (LER) values for both biomass (maximum 1.23) and seed yield (maximum 1.44) were greater than 1, with one exception in experiment 3, indicating that intercrops of wheat and faba beans make more effective use of land than equivalent sole crops. Partial LERs for faba beans were always lower than those of wheat. The tendency was for highest LERs to occur at 75% recommended density. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, seasonal forecasts were used together with a crop simulation model and a simple pasture growth curve to inform several decisions on year-to-year farm management, including on land-allocations in a mixed wheat-sheep farming system. In seasons where above-median rainfall was forecast, N fertiliser applications in cropping were increased to support the higher grain yield potential, sheep stocking rates were increased to take advantage of higher pasture growth and unused pasture land was made available for cropping. In seasons where below-median rainfall was forecast. N fertiliser applications in cropping were reduced to minimise costs, and traditional conservative sheep stocking rates were used. Application of the Predictive Ocean Atmosphere Model for Australia (POAMA) seasonal rainfall forecast yielded additional profit of up to A$66 ha(-1) per annum, equivalent to A$200,000 y(-1) for an average size farm in Western Australia. The largest benefit from applying a forecast in wheat-sheep farms comes from the increase of more profitable cropping during above-median rainfall seasons. This is well above the benefit of previous single-commodity forecast applications, and therefore has widespread potential to improve decision making on mixed crop-livestock farms. With the projected decline of rainfall in the Australian and other rain-fed crop-livestock regions of the world, skilful seasonal forecasting systems will become increasingly valuable as they will assist farm managers to capture the benefits in the declining number of potentially high-production seasons and minimise the input costs in the increasing number of low-production seasons.

We conducted a two-year experiment to assess the effects of two diversification practices-vetch-oat cover cropping and cucumber-snow pea intercropping-on nitrogen (N) cycling and productivity across a farm management gradient. The field experiment spanned 14 farms in southern Brazil with different long-term management histories, ranging from conventional tobacco to agroecological mixed crop-livestock systems. Along this gradient, farm soils with longer histories of agroecological management had higher soil organic carbon, potentially mineralizable carbon, and extractable phosphorus, captured by a principal component reflecting biological soil fertility.  We found that benefits of diversification practices for soil N cycling and productivity were ecologically relevant across the farm gradient within the two-year span of our experiment, with the greatest overall performance on agroecological farms. First, vetch-oat cover crops doubled mean N inputs to soil compared to fallows across all farms. Following cover crop incorporation, N mineralization was twice as high on agroecological farms as on transitioning or conventional farms. At vegetable planting, use of cover crop mixtures explained 67% of the variation in soil N availability, after accounting for the effects of background fertility. Finally, vegetable intercrops had higher productivity than monocrops across farms and years (mean LER=1.19), with stronger overyielding in the second year (mean LER=1.27). On a subset of farms, low soil pH constrained the performance of both diversification practices, reducing vetch N-2 fixation and vegetable intercrop yield (Land Equivalent Ratio, LER). While prior research has emphasized facilitation between diversified crops in lower fertility soils, our results suggest that diversification's advantages for nutrient cycling and productivity are robust to varied soil conditions and accrue over the course of transitions to agroecological management.

Efficacies of habitat management techniques in managing maize stem borers in Ethiopia	CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						"Intercropping; Push-pull; Maize; Stem borers; Napier grass; Desmodium"	"SESAMIA-CALAMISTIS; HUMID TROPICS; LEPIDOPTERA; NOCTUIDAE"	Habitat management techniques to control maize stem borers were tested in eastern (Melkassa and Mieso) and western (Sibu-Sire) Ethiopia. These techniques consisted of using mixed cropping of maize with haricot beans at different maize:bean ratios and a push-pull (PP) strategy utilizing Napier grass as a trap plant around maize plots as the pull and Desmodium in between maize rows as a deterrent or push. In Melkassa, pest infestations were too low for the cropping system to significantly affect pests, plant damage and yields while in Mieso, where the pest densities were high, intercropping of maize with beans at ratios of 1:1 to 2:1 significantly decreased borer densities compared to pure maize stands. Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) and Cotesia flavipes (Cameron) were the major stem borer and parasitoid species, respectively, recorded both at Melkassa and Mieso. Borer parasitism was higher at Mieso than at Melkassa and it tended to increase with the increase of haricot bean ratio in the intercropping system. Land equivalent ratios of >1 indicated higher land use efficiency in mixed compared to sole cropping, even if pest densities were low. Establishment of Desmodium and Napier grass in PP trials varied from site to site, and poor establishment was observed in plots with low soil pH. Where yields varied significantly, they were lower in the PP than the sole maize plots. Borer densities were low and mostly not affected by the cropping system. However, in the second season when borer density was relatively high, higher levels of infestation and leaf feeding scores were recorded in the control than push-pull plots.

Soil erosion in Nepal mid-hills is the most critical during pre-monsoon season. Many reviews argue that reduced tillage could be an option to tackle this problem. However, very few field experiments to evaluate reduced tillage systems have to date been conducted in this region. Thus, a field experiment was initiated in factorial randomized complete block design on acidic sandy loam soil (Lithic Dystochrept) during the summer season of 2001 at Kathmandu University (1500 masl) to assess the effects of tillage and cropping patterns on soil and nutrient losses, crop yield and soil fertility. Two main treatments viz. conventional and reduced till, and two sub-treatments viz. sole maize (Zea mays) and maize + soybean (Glycine max) were considered. Soil organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (N), plant available phosphorus (P) and exchangeable potassium (K) were determined for the original soil and eroded sediment using standard methods. Two years of data indicated annual soil and nutrient losses to be significantly lowered by reduced till as compared to conventional till. Total annual soil loss from conventional and reduced till was 16.6 and 11.1 Mg/ha, respectively. Similarly, annual nutrient losses associated with the eroded sediment were 188 kg OC/ha, 18.8 kg N/ha, < 1 kg P/ha and 3.8 kg K/ha for conventional till and 126 kg OC/ha, 11.8 kg N/ha, < 1 kg P/ha and 2.4 kg K/ha for reduced till. Soil OC and N losses were significantly higher in conventional till and this may be one of the major causes of fertility depletion in the Nepalese hills. Soil chemical properties did not differ due to tillage and cropping systems; however, over years pH, N and P were increased irrespective of treatments. Although treatments were at par for maize grain yield, conventional till + soybean produced highest grain yield (4.0 Mg/ha) followed by reduced till + soybean (3.9 Mg/ha) and conventional till sole maize (3.8 Mg/ha). Mixed cropping of legumes and maize do not help conserve soil and nutrient loss in hills of central Nepal. Thus, reduced till could be a viable option for minimizing soil and nutrient losses without sacrificing economic yields in central hills of Nepal. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The fertilizers gypsum, kieserite, elemental S (40 kg S ha(-1)) and the foliar fertilizer epsom salt (8.4 kg S ha(-1)) have been tested on long-term (> 10 years) organically cultivated arable land in the years 2012 to 2014. The objectives of this study were to evaluate pea's capacity to acquire sulphur as a sole crop and as intercrop with barley. The present investigations suggest that S supply via the pedosphere and the atmosphere was obviously high enough for adequate S concentrations in the pea plants and therefore compensated the barleys competition for plant available S in the mixed stands. The study showed that pea and barley adjusted its S accumulation to its yield formation. Although the fertilization with gypsum and kieserite significantly increased S concentrations and narrowed the N:S ratios in pea, the yield did not rise significantly. An average N:S ratio in pea leaves at flowering of 15.6 and a corresponding S concentration of 0.29% in DM seemed to be adequate to cover the S requirement of pea. The sulphur harvest index (SHI) averaged 0.63 and has not been influenced by the cropping system (sole or mixed crop). The fertilizers gypsum, kieserite and epsom salt showed effects on S concentration in the pea plant, elemental S did not.

Can smallholder farmers buffer rainfall variability through conservation agriculture? On-farm practices and maize yields in Kenya and Malawi	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						"climate resilience; ENSO; climate smart agriculture; El Ni;o; sub-Saharan Africa; conservation agriculture; smallholder farming"	"EL-NINO; AFRICA; ADOPTION; SYSTEMS; IMPACT"	Reduced tillage, permanent ground cover and crop diversification are the three core pillars of Conservation Agriculture (CA). We assess and compare on-farm effects of different practices related to the three pillars of CA on maize yields under ENSO-driven rainfall variability in Kenya and Malawi. Reduced tillage practices increased yields per hectare by 250 kg on average in Malawi under below-average rainfall conditions and by 700 kg in Kenya under above-average rainfall, but did not have any significant effect on yields under below-average rainfall conditions in Kenya. Ground cover had a positive impact on yields in Malawi (dry conditions) but not in Kenya (both dry and wet conditions), where mixed crop and livestock systems limited this practice. Crop diversification had positive impacts in Kenya (both dry and wet conditions), where maize-legume crop rotation is practiced, but not in Malawi where landholdings are too small to allow rotation. Our findings suggest that isolated CA techniques can have positive effects on yields even after only a few years of practice under variable rainfall conditions. This strengthens empirical evidence supporting the value of CA in resilience building of agricultural systems, and suggests that both full and partial adoption of CA practices should be supported in areas where climate change is leading to more variable rainfall conditions.

Stemborers are attracted to Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum), a trap plant (pull), and are repelled from the main cereal crop using a repellent legume intercrop (push), desmodium (Desmodium spp.). Desmodium root exudates effectively control the parasitic striga weed by causing abortive germination. Desmodium also improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, natural mulching, improved biomass and control of erosion. Both companion plants provide high value animal fodder, facilitating milk production and diversifying farmers' income sources. The technology is appropriate to smallholder mixed cropping systems in Africa. It effectively addresses major production constraints, increases maize yields from below 1 to 3.5t/ha, and is economical as it is based on locally available plants, not expensive external inputs. Adopted by over 30,000 farmers to date in East Africa, key factors in its further up-scaling include effective technology dissemination, adaptability of companion plants for climate resilience, capacity building and multi-stakeholder collaboration, integration with livestock husbandry, improvement in input accessibility and creation of a supportive policy framework.

An apparent recovery of growth is observed in late-maturing species after early-maturing species have been harvested, but the mechanism remained unclear. This study tested the hypothesis that the roots of late-maturing species occupy greater below-ground space at later growth stages. The monolith method was employed to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of maize grown alone (no interspecific interactions), maize intercropped with wheat (asymmetric interspecific facilitation before wheat harvesting), and maize intercropped with faba bean (symmetric interspecific facilitation) on August 8, September 2 and September 30, after harvesting of wheat (July 15) or faba bean (August 2). The results show that maize intercropped with wheat occupied more below-ground space at late growth stages than at early growth stages when the two crops grew at the same time, thus supporting our hypothesis. Furthermore, we also found that interspecific interactions during the co-growth stage of the two species led to a longer root life span in both maize intercropped with wheat and faba bean compared to the maize grown alone. The findings may partly explain the recovery of late-maturing species found in intercropping systems between two crop species with different growth stages and the complementary effect on the relationship between plant biodiversity and productivity.

We used traps baited with apple cider vinegar to monitor D. suzukii adult presence in multiple crops and associated fruiting plants at the Wolfskill USDA Germplasm Repository in Winters, CA, USA from 2011 to 2013. Traps were placed in small (similar to 160 m x 40 m on average) almond, apricot, cherry, fig, grape, mulberry, peach, persimmon, plum, and pomegranate deciduous fruit orchard blocks as well as a citrus block and evergreen trees located near a house at the repository. D. suzukii was present in all blocks with the greatest monthly deciduous fruit captures in the cherry and fig blocks. Few D. suzukii were captured in almond, apricot, pomegranate and grape blocks. Deciduous fruit blocks had two distinct periods of trap capture: spring through midsummer and again in fall. Most deciduous fruit blocks had low trap captures during the hottest summer months (August to September) and the coldest winter months (December to April). However, from late December through mid-January, high trap captures were associated with the citrus and house sites. This study provides seasonal trapping data of D. suzukii adults in an unsprayed multi-crop mosaic, and may serve as a model of adult capture patterns across smaller mixed-crop commercial orchards and associated urban landscapes.

Here, we have used a logistic model to analyze the cropping systems (i.e., monocropped faba bean, monocropped wheat, and faba bean intercropped with wheat) by evaluating the effects of different levels of nitrogen application on the dynamic changes in biomass and nitrogen accumulation, along with the interspecific interaction. Using monocropped and intercropped faba beans in field experiments spanning two years, we found that nitrogen application increased both monocropped and intercropped faba bean yields. The yield of intercropped faba beans was greatest at the lower nitrogen input for two consecutive years. Nitrogen application increased the biomass and nitrogen accumulation in both monocropped and intercropped faba beans. The simulation parameters that increased were maximum nitrogen accumulation (A') and maximum accumulation rate (R'(max)) while the initial cumulative rate (r') decreased. Compared with monocropping, intercropped faba bean-wheat showed increased yield and biomass accumulation, along with a significantly increased initial growth rate (r) and a maximum instantaneous growth rate (R-max). Intercropping reduced stem and leaf biomass and the nitrogen distribution ratio while increasing the pod content. In the early intercropped faba bean growth stage, there was no competition for nutrients or any kind of yield advantage, while in the later stages, the nutrient competitiveness of intercropping was stronger than the intraspecific competition, showing the advantages of intercropping on biomass and yield (i.e., relative crowding coefficient [K] >1, relative interspecific competitiveness [RC] >0, and relative competition intensity [RCI] <0). In summary, nitrogen application of 45 kg ha(-1) could be the desired amount that maximizes the nutrient competition and interspecific advantages in the middle and late stages of faba bean growth when intercropped, thus contributing to the yield.

This insect has been reported in Benin as a major pest of maize causing important economic losses and putting at risk food and nutritional security. This study evaluated the damage caused by this pest to maize in different cropping system and management practices. It also assessed predatory ants presence and diversity and their potential in controlling FAW. Results showed that 50% of farmers grow maize in a mixed cropping systems in association with sorghum, cassava and cowpea and also used biopesticides. FAW larval population and damage in maize fields varied accros villages. Surprinsingly FAW larval population was higher in maize field sprayed with insecticides than untreated field. Seven species of predatory ants were recorded in maize field. Ants' population was higher in untreated field (1043 ants per hectare) than treated field (806 ants per hectare). In the laboratory, ants species exhibits great predatory potential. Further studies are needed to discuss uses of ants in FAW management in Benin.

Although playing essential roles in ecosystem functioning, our knowledge about the effects of multiple cropping regimes on the plant microbiome and their interactions is still limited. Here, we designed a pot experiment simulating different cropping regimes. For this purpose, wheat and faba bean plants were grown under controlled greenhouse conditions in monocultures and in two intercropping regimes: row and mixed intercropping. Bacterial and fungal communities in bulk and rhizosphere soils as well as in the roots and aerial plant parts were analyzed using large-scale metabarcoding. We detected differences in microbial richness and diversity between the cropping regimes. Generally, observed effects were attributed to differences between mixed and row intercropping or mixed intercropping and monoculture. Bacterial and fungal diversity were significantly higher in bulk soil samples of wheat and faba bean grown in mixed compared to row intercropping. Moreover, microbial communities varied between crop species and plant compartments resulting in different responses of these communities toward cropping regimes. Leaf endophytes were not affected by cropping regime but bacterial and fungal community structures in bulk and rhizosphere soil as well as fungal community structures in roots. We further recorded highly complex changes in microbial interactions. The number of negative inter-domain correlations between fungi and bacteria decreased in bulk and rhizosphere soil in intercropping regimes compared to monocultures due to beneficial effects. In addition, we observed plant species-dependent differences indicating that intra- and interspecific competition between plants had different effects on the plant species and thus on their associated microbial communities. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating microbial communities in different plant compartments with respect to multiple cropping regimes using large-scale metabarcoding. Although a simple design simulating different cropping regimes was used, obtained results contribute to the understanding how cropping regimes affect bacterial and fungal communities and their interactions in different plant compartments.

These spikelet bases are morphologically distinct from the typical Triticum monococcum L. (einkorn), T. dicoccum Schubl. (emmer) and T. spelta L. (spelt) types previously recorded from Greece and they have also been observed at Neolithic and Bronze Age sites in Turkey, Hungary, Austria and Germany. Their taxonomic identification remains uncertain but it seems likely that they are tetraploid, and they have morphological features in common with T. timopheevi Zhuk. Various possibilities exist for the origin of this type but, whatever its origin and exact identity, its cultivation has ceased over large geographical areas since the Bronze Age. At the northern Greek sites, at least, the new type may have been cultivated as a maslin (mixed crop) with einkorn.

However, this has rarely been studied under field conditions and no data are available for the effects of intercropping. Methods Durum wheat and faba beans were cultivated, both as sole crops and as intercrops, in a P-deficient, calcareous soil over three consecutive growing seasons. We measured a range of plant, soil, and rhizosphere properties at the flowering stage and grain yield at harvest. Results Root dry weight, N fixation, rhizosphere acidification, the ratio of Ca/P in the uptake, and available P in the soil were all higher for faba beans intercropped with durum wheat. However, its growth was limited by other factors, probably including water availability. However, durum wheat growth and nutrient acquisition were markedly facilitated by intercropping with faba beans. The facilitation of P acquisition by durum wheat was caused by the acidification of its rhizosphere, the subsequently higher solubility of Ca-P minerals, and the lack of competition by faba beans for P. Conclusions The results confirm the importance of Ca uptake and the ratio of Ca/P in the uptake for P acquisition by plants in calcareous soils and, more specifically, for a cereal intercropped with faba beans.

Sole cropping of these crops had no relative advantage, while mixed cropping had a relative advantage than sole cropping. Nominal protection coefficient index about sole cropping of bean and intercropping showed that indirect tax has been imposed on producers. The nominal protection coefficient of the input in all types of indirect subsidies for cultivation proved to be opened by the trade. Coefficient of effective support net about sole cropping of beans and intercropping was less than the unit and total input and product markets in these cropping systems were not supported. Finally, the social net profit in beans and millet sole cropping was negative; while intercropping was positive, indicating that intercropping has a social net profitability.

This study was conducted to examine optimal resource allocation in Yam based cropping systems among farmers in Yorro Local Government Area of Taraba State, Nigeria. Primary data used for the study were collected from 142 farmers using structured interview schedule. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and linear programming model. Results revealed that respondents were small-scale farmers characterized by large family size and were well experienced in farming with a mean farming experience of 23 years. Respondents adopted mixed cropping as a result of scarcity of land and to avoid crop failure. Profitability analysis revealed that yam based cropping systems were profitable where Yam/Cowpea/Sorghum had the highest gross margin of (sic)372,500.00 followed by Yam/Maize/Groundnut/Cowpea 0362,990.00) respectively. Linear programming model recommended yam/cowpea/sorghum and yam/maize/groundnut/cowpea out of the five enterprises. For yam/cowpea/sorghum, the existing plan allocated 2.36 ha while the optimal plan obtained from the programming recommended 4.37ha. For yam/maize/groundnut/cowpea, the existing plan allocated 2.08ha while the optimal plan recommended 1.11ha. The optimal farm plan recommends that yam -based farmers should allocate resources in such a way that the two crop enterprises are produced according to this hectarage allocation to maximize Total Gross Margin of (sic)2,031,084.08/ha.

Orobanche crenata is a weedy root parasite that causes huge damage to legume crops. Control strategies have centred around agronomic practices and the use of herbicides, although success has been marginal. Our field experiments show that O. crenata infection on faba bean and pea is reduced when these host crops are intercropped with oat. The number of O. crenata plants per host plant decreased as the proportion of oats increased in the intercrop. Pot and rhizotron experiments confirmed the reduction of infection in faba bean intercropped with cereals. It is suggested that inhibition of O. crenata seed germination by allelochemicals released by cereal roots is the mechanism for reduction of O. crenata infection. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Adaptation in rice-wheat based sodic agroecosystems: A case study on climate resilient farmers' practices	INDIAN JOURNAL OF TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE			English	Article						"Informal experimentation; Traditional ecological knowledge; Location specific adaptations; Rice-wheat based agroecosystems"	MANAGEMENT	Resource-poor farmers, living in marginal environments and more directly dependent on local natural resources, have developed location specific agricultural knowledge systems that help them to adapt to climatic variability. In this research, we documented farmers' perceptions of climatic variability and related adaptive practices in three selected hamlets of Azamgarh district of eastern Uttar Pradesh, India. Data were collected with 60 farmers using participatory rural appraisal (PRA) tools and personal interview methods. We found that the farmers are experiencing climatic variability as reflected by reduced frequency of rains and increased rainfall intensity, and that the farmers' observations were consistent with climate data of the past 100 years (from 1901 to 2000), where at several intervals variations in rainfall were very high. To combat climatic variability among resource-poor community and sodic agroecosystems, farmers have developed, through trial and error, a number of adaptive practices in their subsistence agriculture. These include crop diversification, agronomic manipulations and mixed cropping. Small-scale and marginal farmers practice biodynamic agriculture, where they maintain more than 10 crop species with minimal use of external inputs. Soil type, season, nutrient demand, soil fertility, cost of cultivation and local ecological knowledge are all considerations in these systems. These farmers also use indigenous practices to manage the insect pests in their crops. These adaptations help farmers to reduce environmental risks and minimize crop failures, and thus enhance the livelihoods. Farmers consider their location specific crop systems to be ecologically sustainable, economically viable and culturally acceptable.	"[Singh, Ranjay K.; Kumar, Satyendra; Jat, H.

This study aimed at identifying the key determinants that govern farmers' decisions to adopt multiple components of integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) in a maize mixed cropping system of the Chinyanja Triangle, Southern Africa. Revealed preferences of ISFM components were collected from 320 randomly selected households and multivariate probit (MVP) model was used to analyse the simultaneous effects on adoption based on biophysical plot and household-level socioeconomic attributes. The results show that farmers' choices of a set of ISFM components are determined by a mix of factors that address the trade-offs and synergies among them. Non-farm income, moderate land quality perception, and education influence simultaneous technology adoption, while gender and crop loss increase the likelihood of farmers' decisions to adopt independent options. Having other sources of income supports co-adoption of inorganic fertilizer, residue incorporation, and crop rotation. Input/output market access, access to information, financial sources, and climate variability also play pivotal role in technology adoption. These results indicate that resource availability, learning costs, finances, and risk aversion need to be considered when designing and promoting ISFM technologies as a package.

First, a greater biodiversity in the fields; second, an enrichment of essential trace elements in biogas substrates (cobalt, nickel, manganese, and molybdenum); and third, less use of artificial trace element additives.MethodsIn two randomized field trials, 12 different variants of field crops in sole, double and intercropping were tested over a 2-year period. Dry matter yield, trace element content of the crops, and soil parameters like soil texture, pH, and soil element concentration were determined. The trace element concentrations in biogas plants resulting from input mixtures of energy crops (legumes, amaranth, faba bean, and ryegrass) and maize are calculated.ResultsHigh dry matter yields were obtained for ryegrass, maize, winter faba bean maize, intercropping winter faba bean/triticale-maize, and intercropping rye/vetch-maize. The double croppings with maize reached highest total yields (ca. 30tDMha(-1)). Total element deliveries from the harvest reveal large differences between the variants and the trace elements. Cobalt is provided most by summer faba bean maize and intercropping of winter faba bean/triticale-maize. Ryegrass can deliver the greatest amounts of Manganese and Molybdenum to biogas plants.When these energy crops are added to conventional maize input for biogas production, the trace element concentration in the fermenter can be raised significantly, e.g., 0.03gCot(-1) FM can be attained compared to 0.003gt(-1) with maize silage input only. Sufficient Co can be provided by addition of manure to the input mixture.ConclusionsAlternative energy crops in combination with maize ensure a good dry matter yield per year and provide significantly more trace elements. However, these substrate mixtures alone do not provide enough trace elements, particularly Co. However, enough Co can be supplied by a small addition of manure."

In experiment 1, faba bean (Vicia faba), pea (Pisum sativum), and soybean (Glycine max) grew solely or intercropped with maize (Zea mays) with two N application rates (0, 225 kg ha(-1)). The biomass of faba bean, pea, and maize was significantly increased, whereas that of soybean was decreased when intercropped than solely grown. Aggressivity analyses demonstrate greater N competition ability of faba bean and pea, but not soybean, than maize. An improved NDM (INDM) could mitigate these effects: Nfix-int = [Nleg-int + 1-x/x Nref-int - Nref-sole/x]x + [soilN(leg-int) + 1-x/x soilN(ref-int) - soilN(ref-sole)/x], where x and 1- x are planting area of legume and non- legume in the intercropping system. Compared to traditional NDM (TNDM, Nfix-int = Nleg-int = Nref-sole]) %N-dfa (N derived from air) by INDM was decreased by 54.3% and 39.8% for faba bean, 44.7% and 5.0% for pea, but increased by 113.5% and 191.0% for soybean at the two N application rates, indicating different % Ndfa quantifications between the two methods. In experiment 2, % Ndfa of sole or intercropped faba bean was quantified by TNDM, INDM, and 15N natural abundance method (NA). The % N-dfa only by INDM correlated significantly with that from NA. Both interspecific root interactions and N loss affect % Ndfa estimation. Our results suggested that INDM could be more suitable than TNDM for quantifying % N-dfa of a N2- fixing plant in intercropping systems.

However, there is little knowledge of soil microbial succession in legume-grass mixtures. Therefore, this study was designed to determine the effect of oat and common vetch binary mixtures at three seeding rates on soil bacterial communities. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rDNA fragments was used to profile the structure of the bacterial community in the rhizosphere. Compared with a monoculture of common vetch and oat, the Shannon-Weaver index and species richness of the mixtures were increased. Thirteen cloned monocultures and mixtures of oat and common vetch soil 16S rDNA sequences were deposited to NCBI. Based on the sequencing results, the bands could be identified as related to Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria. Common vetch did not have some bacteria relatives to Sphingomonas spp. Some bacterial taxa could be detected in the ratio of 1:1 and 1:2, but not in the ratio of 1:3, e.g. Myxococcales. The results suggested that the belowground diversity could be promoted by mixed cropping systems.	"[Qiao, Y. J.; Li, Z. Z.; Wang, X.; Zhu, B.; Hu, Y. G.; Zeng, Z.

Here we examined the effect of soil biota and phosphate (P) availability on intercropping advantages in wheat Triticum aestivum/faba bean Vicia faba systems using a pot experiment consisting of soil sterilization treatment and different P supply levels. A complementary experiment on the contribution of different microbial groups was also included using the removal method. Intercropping advantage was observed only in the presence of microbes and was mainly associated with increase in wheat biomass. Overyielding effect was stronger under low-P than high-P conditions, and was negatively correlated with P availability and the effect of soil biota in the monoculture. The effect was likely related to the enlarged active P pools and modified microbial communities associated with the alteration of rhizosphere traits (protons and carboxylates) by the neighbouring faba bean. Similarly, simplification of soil microbes significantly increased the growth and P uptake of wheat plants while faba bean growth was less affected. Synthesis and applications. Our research provides compelling evidence that soil microbiome is important in driving intercropping overyielding by regulating interspecific interactions under nutrient-limited conditions. These findings have important implications for crop species choice in designing and managing intercropping systems where crop functional traits, soil microbiome and nutrient management should be integrated in pursuit of sustainable agriculture."

For this reason, the soybean intercropping approach, sole or mixed cropping with buckwheat, was adopted to examine the influence of inoculation and intercropping of soybean and buckwheat on the subsequent main crop, soybean. Field trials were conducted from 2016 to 2019 in Germany and Poland. For this purpose, soils on which soybeans had not been grown in the past were selected as experimental plots and laid out in a split-plot design. It was surprising that even without inoculation a nodule growth could be documented. However, intercrop inoculation resulted in an average of 12 times more nodules per plant at four out of five sites. In addition, a 43% higher number of nodules was found on the lateral roots of the main soybean crop when intercropping with inoculated soybean occurred. The influence of the intercrop on the main crop soybean also depended on their growth in late summer and autumn. Further, there was a medium relationship (R = 0.7) between the number of nodules in the intercrop soybean and the nitrogen content of the soybean grain in the main crop. In terms of soybean grain yield, a single inoculation of the intermediate soybean crop contributed an average of 5% higher yield and inoculation of both the intercrops, and the main crop improved yield by 15%.

The crop residues were amended with animal dung, and three types of vermibeds were prepared: (i) millet straw (S. vulgare + P. typhoides in equal quantity) + sheep manure (1: 2 ratio) (MS); (ii) pulse bran (V. radiata) + wheat straw (T. aestivum) + cow dung (1: 1: 2 ratio) (PWC); and (iii) mixed crop residues (mixing of all types crop residues, used in this study) + cow dung in 1:1 ratio (MCR + CD). The fourth treatment was cattle shed manure (CSM). Vermicomposting resulted in a significant increase in total N (97.3% to 155%), available P (67.5% to 123.5%), exchangeable K (38.3% to 112.9%), and exchangeable Ca (23.3% to 53.2%), and decrease in organic C content (20.4% to 29.0%) in the different vermibeds. The earthworm showed the higher biomass gain, growth rate (mg wt. worm-1 day-1) and cocoon numbers in the CSM vermibed. The quality of crop residues was directly related to the rate of organic matter mineralization during the vermicomposting. This study suggests that agriculture wastes could be converted into some value-added products, e.g., vermicompost and worm biomass through vermicomposting technology.

In response, technologies are being developed to allow farmers to make productive use of saline land. One option is the use of salt tolerant pasture systems for grazing and localised recharge management. It! this study, a whole-farm bio-economic model of the farming system ill a salt-affected agricultural region of Western Australia is applied to assess the role and profitability of saltland pastures in the mixed crop and livestock farming system that typifies the region. The results of the analysis show that, across a range of scenarios, saltland pastures suited to moderately saline environments offer the twin advantages of improved profit and reduced recharge that will slow the impacts of salinisation. In practice, for an individual farm the optimal area of saltland pasture is likely to vary according to farm landscape characteristics and market conditions. Key profit drivers for the saltland pasture system are identified, its desirable association with lucerne to reduce recharge is highlighted and priorities for future R&D are discussed.

Cereal/legume intercropping increases yields due to species complementarities, it produces high protein food and feed, and it reduces the need for artificial N fertilizer because legumes fix N biologically. In addition, intercropping has the potential to suppress plant diseases, but its efficacy for disease suppression in cereal/legume mixtures has not been well characterized quantitatively. Here we conducted meta-analysis to quantify the disease suppressive effect of intercropping cereals with legumes at different levels of N fertilizer. Intercropping reduced disease incidence (measured by the odds ratio of disease occurrence) by 45% on average. This reduction was significant (P < 0.01) for four out of six studied pathogens: yellow rust (Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici) and mildew (Blumeria graminis) in wheat (Triticum aestivum), and chocolate spot (Botrytis fabae) and Fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum) in faba bean (Vicia faba). Disease reduction was marginally significant for yellow rust in barley (Puccinia striiformis f.sp. hordei) (P < 0.10) and not significant for bean rust (Uromyces fabae). The reduction in disease incidence was greatest during the early stages of epidemics. N fertilizer strongly increased the incidence of powdery mildew of wheat, but it did not affect the incidence of the other diseases and it did not affect the effectiveness of intercropping as a management strategy for disease control. While nitrogen input increased powdery mildew incidence in both sole and intercropped wheat, the incidence was lower in the intercropped than sole wheat at all levels of N input. The disease suppressive effect of intercropping on wheat powdery mildew or any other disease was not affected by the amount of nitrogen fertilizer. The results show that intercropping has a substantial and consistent effect on disease incidence in cereal/faba bean mixtures across studies, but is not sufficient to provide complete disease control. Intercropping is therefore best used as a component in an integrated approach for managing plant diseases.

The latter was used to estimate in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD). Variety had a significant,(P < 0.05) effect on CP and ADL of the straw. The differences between the leaf and stem were significant (P < 0.001) for all parameters. Season affected the nutritive value of the leaf but not of the stem. The nutritive value of the whole straw was strongly correlated to the nutritive value of the leaf (r =0.87) and stem (r = 0.86). The urea treatment increased CP from 99 to 121 g/kg DM and ME from 6.02 to 6.39 Mj/kg DM. The effect of treatment was thus much lower than the variance among varieties, so that selection for better quality straw without compromising pea yield could be interesting option for smallholder farmers in mixed crop - livestock systems.

To explore genetic and environmental variability of food-feed traits in lentil genotypes, straws of 78elite genotypes and 4 checks of early and late maturing lentil types were evaluated for their nutritive value and potential trade-offs of the nutritive parameters with straw yield and grain yield. Further, effects of genotypic and environmental sources on variation in the nutritive value were also determined. Straw nutritive traits were analyzed by a combination of conventional laboratory techniques and Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy. Results from eight trials carried out across 3 different sites in Ethiopia showed highly significant genotypic variation (P<0.05) in grain yield, straw yields and straw nutritive traits. This confirmed the existence of exploitable genetic variation in these traits. Similarly, the relationship between grain yield and straw yield was positive. The correlation between grain yield and nutritive parameters of straw was insignificant or negative. The correlation between maturity types and straw traits was either neutral or negative. Genotype by environment interactions were significant (P<0.05) for straw yield and nutritive traits indicating that variation in the traits is dependent of environment. It is possible to develop genotypes with a combination of food-feed traits from early and late maturing lentil types to address the high demand for grain and livestock fodder in various agro ecological zones in mixed crop-livestock farming systems using appropriate breeding approaches.

In recent years, faba bean production and productivity are constrained by faba bean gall (Olpidium viciae Kusano) disease in Ethiopia's highlands. A total of 304 faba bean fields from 10 districts in three zones were surveyed during the 2019 and 2020 main cropping seasons to (1) assess the spatial distribution, prevalence, and intensity of faba bean gall disease and (2) determine its association with agro-ecological factors in northwestern Ethiopia. Weather data of each district were collected from meteorological stations and used for descriptive analysis. The gall disease prevalence (94.07%), incidence (43.41%), and severity (25.36%) were the highest in South Gondar. The gall disease was more severe in Tach Gayint (32.58%), followed in Lay Gayint and East Estie (25.34%) districts. The gall symptom was also observed on field pea, lentil, and vetch legume crops. The associations of faba bean gall disease intensity with agro-ecological factors were analyzed using the ordinal logistic regression model. Variables such as geographic area (zone), altitude, sowing date, and year were significantly associated with high disease incidence (> 50%) and severity (> 25%) in the model. Lower disease intensity had a strong association with intercropping, sowing from July to 15 August, good weed management, and altitudes below 2800 m. The gall disease epidemic was directly associated with high altitudes above 2800 m. High rainfall and humidity, leaf wetness, low temperature, and rain splash were identified as the most important driving for the gall disease epidemic and establishment in faba bean. Since a water-loving pathogen causes the gall disease, late sowing from July to 15 August, intercropping, good drainage, and growing faba bean below 2800 m should be considered as management options for the disease in faba bean production areas.

In this study, a two-year field experiment with typical maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] relay strip intercropping (2:2 maize-to-soybean rows; 200 cm bandwidth) was carried out in the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons. The quantitative effects of various planting patterns on the water-use efficiency (WUE) and water distribution were investigated. Our results indicated that soil volumetric water content and soil evaporation in the intercropping systems showed decreasing trends in the order: maize row (MM) < maize-to-soybean row (MS) < soybean row (SS). The highest leaf transpiration (1.91 and 2.07 mmol m(-2) s(-1)) for the intercropped maize was measured in each of the two years in the 20 cm maize narrow-row planting pattern and decreased thereafter. Opposite trend was observed for the intercropped soybean; the highest soybean leaf transpiration (7.01 and 6.80 mmol m(-2) s(-1) for 2013 and 2014, respectively) was recorded in the 70 cm. The WUE of maize and soybean intercrops was lower than that of sole crop counterparts. However, the maximum group water use efficiency (GWUE) of 26.08 and 26.20 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) in the 40-50 cm maize narrow-row planting pattern was, respectively, 39.6% and 23% higher compared with that of sole crops. The water equivalent ratio (WER) values ranged from 1.60-1.79, suggesting better crop water use in the intercrops over sole cropping. Planting patterns provided by 40-50 cm maize narrow-row spacing were considered the most efficient in terms of maximum total yields, GWUE and WER. These results suggest that an appropriate reduction in the spacing of narrow maize row with wide soybean row could be an efficient crop management method to achieve optimal WUE and homogeneous water distribution in maize-soybean intercropping systems."

ECONOMIC EVALUATION OF DIFFERENT IRRIGATION SYSTEMS FOR WHEAT PRODUCTION IN RECHNA DOAB, PAA	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						"Water productivity; efficient irrigation; benefit cost ratio; Rechna Doab; Internal Rate of Return (IRR)"		This study was designed to investigate causes responsible for low water productivity and demonstrate various irrigation techniques at farmers' fields for its improvement. A comprehensive questionnaire was designed and 230 farmers were interviewed in cotton-wheat area, mixed crop area, and rice-wheat area, in Rechna Doab located in Punjab, Pakistan. The results showed that majority of the farmers is concerned over shortage of canal water, energy and fertilizer related issues which were the main factors affecting their water productivity (WP). Field experiments showed that drip irrigation method gave WP of 2.26 kg m(-3) for wheat crop and 40% water saving as compared with conventional irrigation method. Perforated pipe irrigation technique also resulted in relatively better WP of 1.46 kg m(-3) and saved water up to 20%. Benefit Cost ratios for drip, perforated pipe and conventional were 2.47, 2.2 and 1.96, respectively. The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for drip and perforated pipe irrigations over conventional irrigation practices were 40% and 36%, respectively. These findings suggested that flexible irrigation techniques in response to crop water requirements can improve land and water productivity, by building on farm water storages and conveying water through pipes to minimize the losses.

Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), as an effective crop monitoring tool, is extensively used in crop yield estimation. However, there are few studies focusing on the aspect of mixed crops grown together. In this study, a correlation-based approach for crop yield estimation is applied to three small counties (Jianshui, Luliang, and Qiubei) in the Nanpan River basin, Yunnan Province of China, and three main crops (paddy rice, winter wheat, and corn) in these areas are selected. Based on the correlation analysis between MODIS-NDVI data and crop yield, the crop planting areas as well as the best periods for a reliable estimation are identified. The best time is found approximately coinciding with the periods of heading, flowering, and filling of the crops. By Akaike's information criterion, the most fit regression models with extracted NDVI in the corresponding crop planting areas are determined. They work reasonably well in small regions, especially in the areas where crop types are unknown exactly. Further improvements to the regression models are possible by incorporating other physical factors such as soil types and geographical information.

Currently, little is known about the effects of selected cover crops on soil fungal and bacterial communities in no-till systems. In this study, eight cover crops, three mixed crops, and an unmanaged fallow control were evaluated over 2 years for their effects on the soil microbiome. Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was performed to characterize fungal and bacterial communities in the soil during the cover crop growing season, and in the subsequent year. Fungal and bacterial alpha diversity significantly increased over time and were influenced in the subsequent growing season by choice of cover crops. Some fungal and bacterial trophic and functional groups were also affected by crop choice. Fungal pathotroph abundance was positively associated with oilseed radish, alfalfa, and phacelia, but negatively associated with sorghum???sudangrass. Beneficial symbiotrophic fungi and functional nitrification-related bacterial groups were also associated with sorghum???sudangrass and buckwheat. These findings suggest that choice of cover crops influences the soil microbial community composition and may impact plant health in the subsequent crops.

Using Protector Plants to Reduce the Incidence of Papaya Ringspot Virus-Watermelon Strain in Zucchini	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						"Aphis gossypii; Myzus persicae; nonpersistent virus; barrier crop; virus sink"	"APHID-BORNE VIRUSES; CUCUMBER MOSAIC-VIRUS; ALARM PHEROMONE; MYZUS-PERSICAE; TRANSMISSION; POTATO; CROPS; MANAGEMENT; EPIDEMICS; VECTORS"	The use of plant diversification (e. g., mixed cropping, cover crops, border plants, intercrops, etc.) to protect a primary crop from insect transmitted viral diseases is often referred to as barrier cropping. Specific plants used to mitigate virus incidence in a cash crop are frequently called protector plants. The potential use of protector plants to reduce the density of aphid vectors and incidence of aphid-borne nonpersistent virus in zucchini, Cucurbita pepo L. was evaluated during 2003, 2005, and 2006 on Oahu, HI. Cover crops, buckwheat Fagopyrum esculentum Moench and white clover Trifolium repens L., or sunn hemp, Crotolaria juncea L. and an intercropped vegetable, okra Abelmonchus esculentus (L.), were evaluated for their potential use as protector plants. Results of the field experiments showed that densities of alatae aphids in water pan traps did not differ significantly among treatment habitats during three field experiments. However, the percentage of zucchini plants showing virus symptoms was significantly lower in diculture than monoculture habitat during all 3 yr. Results from field and laboratory experiments support the hypothesis that protector plants reduced the incidence of Papaya ringspot virus-watermelon strain by acting as virus sinks and that the three cover crops were more effective in reducing Papaya ringspot virus-watermelon spread than okra.

To address this question, common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv. El Djadida) and maize (Zea mays L cv. Filou), were grown as sole- and inter-crops in two experimental sites; S1 (P-deficient) and S2 (P-sufficient) during two growing seasons (2011 and 2012). Growth, nodulation and grain yield were assessed and correlated with the rhizosphere soil P availability. Results showed that P availability significantly increased in the rhizosphere of both species, especially in intercropping under the P-deficient soil conditions. This increase was associated with high efficiency in use of the rhizobial symbiosis (high correlation between plant biomass and nodulation), plant growth and resource (nitrogen (N) and P) use efficiency as indicated by higher land equivalent ratio (LER> 1) and N nutrition index (for maize) in intercropping over sole cropping treatments. Moreover, the rhizosphere P availability and nodule biomass were positively correlated (r(2) = 0.71, p < 0.01 and r(2) = 0.62, p < 0.01) in the intercropped common bean grown in the P-deficient soil during 2011 and 2012. The increased P availability presumably improved biomass and grain yield in intercropping, though it mainly enhanced grain yield in intercropped maize. Our findings suggest that modification in the intercropped common bean rhizosphere-induced parameters facilitated P uptake, plant biomass and grain yield for the intercropped maize under P-deficiency conditions.

Tanzania and Ethiopia, up to 44% of the dietary calorie requirements is provided by maize. It is also recognized that livestock are an essential asset of poor farmers in the mixed crop-livestock systems in this region. One of the major constraints to their productivity is, however, feed availability. A significant proportion of this feed is sourced from maize stover. We engaged in a multi-disciplinary research of dual-purpose maize cultivars with the purpose of contributing to smallholder food security. The specific objective of our endeavor is to better match new maize cultivars to farmers' needs by including fodder traits in maize improvement programs in Ethiopia, Tanzania and Kenya. We explored a novel approach for targeting maize breeding research. Agricultural development strategies must recognize heterogeneity in bio-physical, economic, socio-cultural, institutional and environmental factors when devising interventions and investments. The research effort into maize as a food and feed resource was, therefore, carried out in a cross-section of bio-physically and socio-economically contrasting areas across the three study countries. To this effect the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre's traditional targeting framework, maize mega-environments (MMEs), was combined with recommendation domains for dual-purpose maize using a Geographical Information System (GIS). The GIS-based approach provided a spatial framework for the structured exploration of opportunities to transfer knowledge and technologies. Results show that maize is potentially an important feed resource in areas with high feed demand. Throughout the different MMEs, a range of different incentives for dual-purpose varieties can be found. The maps with recommendation domains for dual-purpose maize will facilitate better targeting of new maize cultivars. Cultivars with good quality stover can now be preferentially promoted in areas with high demand for stover as feed, while at the same time matched to the bio-physically most suitable mega-environment. This integrated approach is widely applicable and will help increase the impacts from agricultural research. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mean dry matter yield of pure oats was 6.07 t/ha and that of pure vetch was 4.14 t/ha (P<0.05), with the highest yield (6.32 t/ha) in the 45:55 oats: vetch mixture. Crude protein (CP) concentration in harvested dry matter increased as level of vetch in the mixture increased, with 8.5% CP in pure oats and 22.3% in pure vetch. CP yield peaked (1.1 t/ha) in the 45:55 oats: vetch mixture. Common vetch was a more competitive crop than oats in all mixtures except for 25:75 and 15:85 oats: vetch mixtures.

A field survey was conducted for the sampling of Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) inhibitor resistance littleseed canarygrass, a major weed of wheat, from Punjab, Pakistan in 2014 for confirmation of resistance. The surveyed regions encompassed four different cropping systems including rice-wheat, maize-wheat, cotton-wheat and mixed cropping. Dose-response assay was conducted for confirmation of resistance. Efficacy of herbicide mixtures including clodinafop-propargyl, metribuzin, pinoxaden and sulfosulfuron at a range of doses was investigated to manage littleseed canarygrass. Results revealed that all populations were resistant to fenoxaprop except PM-BWL-2. The higher level resistance (6.5) was found in populations collected from rice-wheat cropping system. The tested herbicide mixtures at 75% and 100% of the recommended dose of each mixture component provided the effective control of resistant littleseed canarygrass. Mixtures at 50% provided more than 80% control and reduced growth and seed production potential of surviving plants. The confirmation of ACCase inhibitor resistance as the first case of herbicide resistance in Pakistan, leads us to discourage use of ACCase inhibitor herbicides alone. However, herbicide mixtures at 75% and 100% of the recommended dose are suggested to manage this weed for sustainable wheat production in the surveyed cropping systems.

Recent studies have demonstrated that maize root exudates can drive interspecific facilitation to enhance N-2 fixation of bean in intercropping systems. However, the mechanisms of N-2 fixation enhancement stimulated by root exudates in the intercropping systems remain unclear. Four experiments were designed to provide a progressively deeper understanding of how root exudates stimulate microbial-mediated N-2 fixation. First, the effects of faba bean/maize intercropping on yields and soil microbial communities were determined in a field experiment. Second, root-derived interspecific facilitation was evaluated using a root partitioning approach. Third, the key microbial taxa in the faba bean rhizosphere were traced using C-13-labelled maize root exudates. Fourth, the co-driven mechanism of maize root exudates and micro-organisms in the faba bean rhizosphere were explored. Faba bean/maize intercropping with maize residue return increased the yields of faba bean (26%), maize (27%) and broccoli (9.1%) compared to that under monocropping. Nodulin-like 4 (NODL4), chalcone-flavanone isomerase (CFI) and early nodulin-like (ENODL2) gene expression in faba bean roots intercropped with maize increased by 1.5-2.3-fold compared to that observed under monoculture. More than half of the N-2 fixation of faba bean increase under intercropping was due to interactions with micro-organisms. Nine key bacterial genera in the faba bean rhizosphere were identified by C-13-DNA-based stable isotope probing analysis. Among them Agromyces, Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Lysobacter and Paenibacillus directly fix N-2, while Gemmatimonas, Heliobacillus, Natronocella and Sorangium increase the N-2 fixation capacity of Azotobacter by providing additional carbon sources. These key bacteria triggered by maize root exudates played an important role in the rhizosphere facilitation of intercropping. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrated a novel root-root facilitation of N-2 fixation and increased crop yields co-driven by root exudates and rhizosphere bacteria under faba bean/maize intercropping, and nine key bacteria associated with this process were identified by C-13-DNA-based stable isotope probing. We recommend the adoption and optimization of intercropping systems with residue return to reduce the shortcomings of continuous cropping and to increase the sustainability of crop production.

This study aimed to increase the productivity and quality of mixed-species stands of Sudan grass and sunflower in systems of haylage and silage using crops mixed with spring vetch and soybean at different levels of mineral fertilization. The study objectives included the assessment of advantages, yield capacity, chemical composition, and fodder value of Sudan grass and sunflower in both pure form and when mixed with legumes at harvest for haylage and silage. The findings were based on various levels of mineral nutrition. Mixed-species crops typically form thick haulm stands with large, tiered assimilation surfaces that generate high yields of phytomass. The use of mixed crops of traditional cultures with legumes will significantly enrich the phytomass of species mixtures with respect to protein, fat, and ash elements. Complex cenoses planted for production of digestible protein were significantly more productive than Sudan grass and sunflower crops alone; they provided a greater yield of fodder units and a good nutritional balance with added protein. During the present study, the influence of legume components on the composition of amino acids in haylage and silage was analyzed for treatments with and without fertilizers. The use of fertilizers generally increased the amino acids content of crops. Among the species mixtures of silage treatments studied here, on the basis of the amino acid composition of the phytomass, the sunflower-soybean mixture provided relatively high protein content and the most nutrients."

The comprehension of such phenomena places big methodological challenges, and still needs clarification. The objectives of this work were (i) to test if a species with coloured roots can be used to examine the interaction in a legume-non-legume intercropping system; (ii) to verify the importance of initial root growth on the successive root development of mixture component plants; (iii) to test if the root interaction in the shallow layers has consequences for deep root growth and (iv) to compare the effect of intraspecific and interspecific competition on root development and biomass growth. Methods A detailed study on root growth and interaction was carried out using rhizotron tubes where two legume species were grown in pure stands or were intercropped with red beet, a variety of Beta vulgaris L. with clear red roots. Within the rhizotrons, the three species were grown either without competitors, with two plants of the same species to measure intraspecific competition or with one legume and one red beet plant to study interspecific competition. The use of mixtures where one component has clearly coloured roots, together with several scalar measurements of root depth and proliferation, allowed the measurement of the root system of each species when grown in the mixtures. Important findings The use of rhizotron tubes coupled with species with coloured roots represented a valuable method to study the belowground interaction in mixed cropping systems. The initial root growth was a very important feature for the subsequent dominance of a species and it was not related to seed dimension. Initial root growth was also important because the root interactions in the shallower soil layers were found to influence the root growth in deeper soil. The root system of the red beet showed much faster and deeper growth than that of the legumes, and made red beet the dominant component in the mixtures while the legume root system was confined to the shallower soil layer. Intraspecific competition was well tolerated by the legumes, but it was limiting for the highly competitive red beet. The outcome of root interaction between neighbour plants was confirmed to be species-specific as it changed according to the intensity of the competitive effect/response of each species of the mixture: both legumes were slightly affected by the intraspecific and highly affected by interspecific competition while red beet was more affected by intraspecific competition but strongly dominant when intercropped with legumes."

Sweet blue lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) seed as a substitute for concentrate mix supplement in the diets of yearling washera rams fed on natural pasture hay as basal diet in Ethiopia	TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION			English	Article						"Blue lupin; Sweet lupin; Washera sheep; Concentrate mix; Weight gain; Feed intake"	"SHEEP FED HAY; FEED-INTAKE; GRADED-LEVELS; DIGESTIBILITY; MEAL; BRAN"	In the mixed crop-livestock farming system of Ethiopia where crop residues are the major feed resources and concentrate supplement feeds are not common, home-grown legume protein sources can help to minimise the feed problem. A 69-day feeding experiment on sheep was conducted to evaluate the potential of sweet blue lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) cultivar Sanabor seed as a substitute for commercial concentrate supplement. Thirty yearling male intact Washera sheep with initial body weight of 21 +/- 1.38 kg (mean +/- SD) were used. The design was a randomised complete block design with six replications. The five experimental supplement feeds were 453 g concentrate (T1), 342 g concentrate + 74 g lupin seed (T2), 228 g concentrate + 147 g lupin seed (T3), 116 g concentrate + 219 g lupin seed (T4) and 290 g lupin seed (T5) in dry matter basis to supplement around 100 g crude protein per day per animal. There were significant differences (P < 0.05) in total dry matter, crude protein, ash and organic matter intakes among treatments. The average daily body weight gain for T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 was 91, 79, 79, 87 and 74 g/day, respectively, and this difference was not significant (P > 0.05). It was concluded that blue lupin seed has a potential to substitute the commercial concentrate supplement feed in Ethiopia.

While maize monoculture has contributed to reduce rural poverty, many farmers are now confronted to declining yields, indebtedness, rising health and environmental concerns. Interventions at two different stages of the maize boom, i.e. expansion-intensification and distress-diversification phases, allowed capturing the main drivers of change in maize production systems, and assessing opportunities and constraints for the adoption of more sustainable maize-legume mixed systems. The successive innovations in maize cropping systems, i.e. introduction of hybrid seeds, motorized tillage, herbicides, service provision, planters, and mineral fertilizers, were mainly driven by productivity and profitability objectives. Farmers' interest in maize-legume mixed systems was low during maize expansion-intensification phase. The decline in maize profitability and new market outlets for legumes open new opportunity windows for maize-legume mixed systems. Yet, farmers' adoption of such systems is limited by (i) local perceptions of legumes as cash crops only, and (ii) farmers' least effort strategies that includes e.g. heavy herbicide use and livestock free roaming after maize harvest. Large-scale adoption of maize-legume mixed systems requires innovative intervention mechanisms to engage local stakeholders into redesigning their landscapes and value-chains.

Success with adopting CA on farms in Africa has been limited, despite more than two decades of research and development investments. Through analyzing past and on-going CA experiences in a set of case studies, this paper seeks to better understand the reasons for the limited adoption of CA and to assess where, when and for whom CA works best. CA is analyzed and understood within a framework that distinguishes the following scales of analysis: field, farm, village and region. CA has a potential to increase crop yields in the fields, especially under conditions of erratic rainfall and over the long-term as a result of a gradual increase of overall soil quality. The impact on farm income with the practice of CA on some fields of the farm is far less evident, and depends on the type of farm. The lack of an immediate increase in farm income with CA explains in many cases the non-adoption of CA. Smallholders have often short-term time horizons: future benefits do not adequately outweigh their immediate needs. Another key factor that explains the limited CA adoption in mixed crop-livestock farming systems is the fact that crop harvest residues are preferably used as fodder for livestock, preventing their use as soil cover. Finally, in most case studies good markets for purchase of inputs and sale of produce - a key prerequisite condition for adoption of new technologies - were lacking. The case studies show clear evidence for the need to target end users (not all farmers are potential end user of CA) and adapt CA systems to the local circumstances of the farmers, considering in particular the farmer's investment capacity in the practice of CA and the compatibility of CA with his/her production objectives and existing farming activities. The identification of situations where, when and for whom CA works will help future development agents to better target their investments with CA. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

What determines a productive winter bean-wheat genotype combination for intercropping in central Germany?

Our study evaluates the performance of three winter wheat cultivars and eight winter faba bean genotypes (experimental inbred lines) sown as replacement row intercrops with sole cropping comparisons. Detailed agronomic, physiological and soil-based measurements were taken over three consecutive autumn-sown seasons at two sites (a marginal versus a fertile soil) in central Germany. This study aimed to contribute to our understanding of key traits required to achieve highly complementary and well-performing intercrops. Faba bean plus wheat intercrops yielded higher than sole crop equivalents at both sites, but more so at the marginal site (34 % > 12 %). High intercrop yields were associated with high wheat component yields. Such stands included faba bean genotypes that exhibited low leaf area index (LAI) values and low plant height. Tall and large faba beans i.e. with high vegetative biomass led to excessive lodging, both as a sole crop and when intercropped. To some extent, this concealed effects of faba bean genotype trait variation that would have otherwise been visible had lodging not occurred. The expression of these traits was heavily influenced by variation in environmental conditions. At the less fertile site, even tall intercropped faba beans showed relatively lower vegetative biomass, which promoted intercropped wheat and led to superior overyielding values and relative yield total. While site-specific differences are key, German winter faba beans need further genetic improvement to refrain from superfluous biomass growth when water resources are plentiful.	"[Nelson, W. C.

Using mixed-effect linear models, we compared the yield and weed amounts of rapeseed intercropped with different CP species with that of rapeseed as a sole crop in an unique dataset of 79 field experiments covering a wide range of climate, soil and practices conditions in the northwestern part of France, from 2009 to 2015. Bayesian model averaging procedure was used to determine the relative contributions of sites characteristics to the effects of intercropping.& para;& para;Before winter, field pea and faba bean had accumulated the largest amounts of dry mass, with more than 100 g m(-2). Rapeseed biomass was reduced by 56% by non-legume CPs and by only 18% by legume CPs, the largest decrease being caused by pea. Non-legumes decreased the nitrogen nutrition index of rapeseed by 7%, whereas pea and faba bean increased this index by 6% and 3%, respectively. Intercropping with non-legume and legume CPs reduced weed amounts by 52% and 38% respectively, with no difference between CP species. Non legume CPs decreased rapeseed yield at harvest by 0.581 ha(-1), whereas faba bean and faba bean + lentil in creased yield by 0.16 and 0.12 t ha(-1) respectively, when fertilized at the recommended rate. Intercropping with faba bean, lentil or a mixture of both made it possible to reduce nitrogen applications by 30-40 kg ha(-1) with no significant decrease in rapeseed yield. Faba bean and faba bean + lentil mixtures had the best overall performance.

A two-factor field trial involving two planting patterns (mono-cropped wheat [MW] and wheat intercropped with faba bean) and four N levels (N0, N1, N2, and N3 with respective application rates of 0, 90, 180, and 270 kg ha(-1) for wheat) were studied. Nitrogen accumulation and allocation were determined, and the GS and GOGAT activities and their gene expression in the leaves were analyzed. The results showed that wheat total aboveground N accumulation and grain N accumulation were increased when wheat was intercropped with faba bean. Intercropped wheat (IW) presented higher N translocation efficiency (NTE) than MW (except for the N3 level during 2018-2019) during the reproductive growth stage. Thus, the grain yield (except for the N3 level), N harvest index (NHI), and apparent N recovery rate (ANR) were higher in IW than in MW. In addition, total GS, Fd-GOGAT, and NADH-GOGAT activities in the wheat leaves were increased by 27 %-42 %, 17 %-44 %, and 15 %-25 %, respectively, under the N0, N1, and N2 levels from the stem elongation to filling stages when wheat was intercropped with faba bean. On average, GS1, GS2, Fd-GOGAT, and NADH-GOGAT gene expression in the IW flag leaves was 1.4-4.3 times, 1.2-3.6 times, 1.2-2.2 times, and 1.4-6.7 times higher, respectively, than that in MW. Both GS and GOGAT activity and gene expression were tightly related to straw N accumulation and NTE rather than grain N accumulation based on simple correlation analysis. In addition, wheat total N accumulation at maturity was more sensitive to GS and GOGAT activity and gene expression in the flag leaves during the heading, flowering, and filling stages, and ANR only linked with GS and GOGAT activity at the filling stage. Hence, it could be concluded that up-regulated GS and GOGAT activity and gene expression induced by intercropping during the reproductive growth stages contributed to higher NTE and NUE in intercropping. These findings suggest that interspecies interactions modulated GS and GOGAT, which play a crucial role in the intercropping advantage and provide insight into the mechanism of enhanced NUE under intercropping.

Intercropping systems in China and elsewhere have come under pressure through labor migration, growing water scarcity, changing crop prices and other factors. However, little hard evidence is available on how these socio-economic factors interplay and affect the prevalence of intercropping systems now and in the near future. The objective of this study is to explore the effect of growing scarcity of (water and labor) resources and declining (maize) grain prices on the share of intercropping in the optimal cropping plan and on associated agricultural income levels in an intercropping-dominated agricultural system in China. To undertake this analysis, we developed a mathematical programming model to simulate crop production for a model village in Gaotai county in the Hexi Corridor in northwest China, for given resources and economic conditions in 2013 and possible changes (scenarios) in the future. In the Hexi Corridor, conventional wheat/maize intercropping contributed greatly to rising food production while cash crops integrated with maize provided important cash income. With the introduction of seed crops and stricter water regulations, intercropping has become less prevalent in this area in recent years. In the absence of water constraints and at price levels and labor availability in 2013, our model results indicate that an optimal land use would entail that all land would be devoted to intercropping. Sole cumin and sole cotton enter the optimal cropping plan when water becomes scarce and the maize price declines substantially, while increases in hired labor wages have a strong negative impact on intercropping only when on-farm labor becomes scarce.

Due to the beneficial eco-agricultural effects of grain legumes, their integration in mixed cropping systems such as intercropping systems can be more beneficial to soil fertility, soil functioning, and nutrient cycling. About 16-22% of the world's food is provided by cropping systems. On smallholder farms in Eastern and Southern Africa, the integration of legumes has the potential to increase maize (Zea mays) production up to 35% (e.g., Maize-pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) intercropping). Legume-based intercropping systems can also promote rhizobacterial community diversity and soil health by enhancing symbiotic and non-symbiotic beneficial population. In the rhizosphere, the bacterial community is required to improve the growth and health of both intercrops due to several direct and indirect mechanisms involving plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). This review aims to highlight the importance of both legume-based intercropping and root associated microorganisms particular emphasis on rhizobacteria; since the whole crop-crop-microorganism system has the potential to improve crop agro-physiological performance. This study also discusses the key role of legumes as intercrops being fully synergistic with PGPR contributing to crop yield stability under stressful conditions, notably drought and nutrient deficiency. Thus, intercropping can be used as an agroecological practice to ensure the sustainability of production."

Water extracts of various concentrations (from 5 to 50 %) were prepared. The results were compared with the control treatment (distilled water). To estimate the growth rate of plants, the number of buds and leaves, plant height and the general condition of plants were examined. In regard to the chemical interaction of crops in mixed cropping, it was found that water extracts from sorghum seeds have a significant amount of allelopathically active substances revealing both phytotoxic and stimulating effects on the germination and germination vigour of sugar beet seeds. The water extracts of 'Medovyi' seeds showed the lowest allelopathic effect compared to other cultivars under study. Water extract of 'Sylosne 42' appeared relatively tolerant to germination of sugar beet seeds. The extract of 'Medovyi' seeds was filtered and added into the agar medium on which the clones of Beta vulgaris L. were planted. Allelopathically active substances did not affect sugar beet plants on the 7th day after planting. A decrease in the number of buds, leaves and plant height was recorded on the 14th day. On the 21st day, sugar beet plants looked suppressed and eventually died off. Understanding of physical and biochemical mechanisms of plants interaction allows selecting physiologically compatible plants for high-productive phytocoenoses.

Undersowing winter oilseed rape with frost-sensitive legume living mulches to improve weed control	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"Agroecology; Legume living mulch; Weed control; Winter oilseed rape; Intercropping; Soil nitrogen availability; Interspecific competition"	"WHEAT TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; PEA-BARLEY INTERCROPS; COVER CROPS; BRASSICA-NAPUS; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION; QUANTILE REGRESSION; FORAGE LEGUMES; N-2 FIXATION; CLOVER"	Living mulches are generally seen as a possible way to decrease the reliance on pesticides. We investigated the effect of a frost-sensitive legume living mulch on weed control during the autumn and cash crop performance, in winter oilseed rape crops. A field trial was carried out over two years, comparing seven legume species-fenugreek, spring faba bean, grass pea, lentil, field pea, berseem clover and spring common vetch-and three legume mixtures, as living mulches, in crops with two levels of soil mineral nitrogen content before sowing. The presence of the legume living mulch decreased weed abundance before winter. Field pea, berseem clover, common vetch and the common vetch/faba bean/berseem clover mixture were particularly effective, regardless of the growing conditions, decreasing weed abundance by 20-75% with respect to that in the crop grown alone, in the absence of herbicide application. Weed abundance before winter was negatively correlated with total intercrop biomass, and this relationship was dependent on the legume species considered and soil mineral nitrogen content. As with other legume intercrops, the level of soil mineral nitrogen had a strong influence on intercrop structure, modifying the proportion of legume biomass produced. The legume/oilseed rape biomass ratio was also found to be a useful indicator in all growing conditions: the higher the ratio, the more efficient the weed control. However, a high ratio was associated with a higher risk of competition with the cash crop. The choice of the most appropriate legume living mulch is therefore a compromise between the anticipated ecosystem services and the potential disservices provided by the legume mulch. The introduction of a legume living mulch did not entirely prevent weed growth, but was clearly a relevant agroecological solution for decreasing herbicide, while increasing the sustainability and diversity of weed-control strategies in cropping systems.

JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION			English	Article						"Intercropping; Grain legume; Wheat; Root exudates; Acid phosphomonoesterase; Phosphorus availability"	"TRITICUM-AESTIVUM L.; LUPINUS-ALBUS L.; ZEA-MAYS L.; ACID-PHOSPHATASE; PHOSPHORUS AVAILABILITY; ORGANIC-ACIDS; CARBOXYLATE CONCENTRATIONS; RHIZOSPHERE PROPERTIES; CITRATE EXUDATION; PLANT-PARAMETERS"	The purpose of the study is to assess the ability of three different grain legume species to facilitate phosphorus (P) uptake by intercropped wheat and to evaluate the differences in root exudation and phosphatase activity that each grain legume species can induce in the soil. In a pot experiment under controlled climatic conditions, lupin, pea, and faba bean intercropped with durum wheat and respective sole crops were grown at high and low phosphorus availability. At the flowering time of each grain legume, intercrop and sole crops were sampled. Intercropping favored wheat P uptake more at low P availability than at high P availability. Compared to the sole crop, wheat P uptake was greater in intercropping with pea both without and with the addition of phosphorus and with lupin when phosphorus was not added. Phosphatase activity, which was generally high, was highest in soil with lupin and faba bean sole crops. In the rhizosphere of faba bean, the highest total carboxylate concentration was also measured, followed by pea and lupin. Root exudation was favored by P supply, showing greater values in intercropped wheat than in the respective sole crops. P uptake by wheat was not directly linked to greater root exudation in the tested intercropping systems. Even if root exudation and available phosphorus were generally greater with legumes both in sole crop and in intercropping, other interactions such as complementarity and competition were involved, hiding potential facilitation exerted by faba bean and bringing out the benefits from the wheat/pea combination.

Data on total biomass and its allocation to roots, stems and leaves were obtained from field experiments with C. album planted at two densities in pure and mixed stands with either cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. convar. botrytis var. botrytis) or faba beans (Vicia faba L.). After germination, C. album produced biomass rapidly; weeds planted at low density accumulated 20-30% less dry matter than plants growing at a 2.5-fold higher density per m(2). A close correlation between the transmission of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and leaf area index was found. Biomass production was linearly related to cumulative PAR intercepted, but a seasonal variation of the radiation-use efficiency could not entirely be explained. The root:shoot ratio was constant, whereas the level of competitive stress changed the distribution pattern between stems and leaves. With increasing competition in the cauliflower experiments, C. album allocated relatively more biomass to stems than to leaves; this was less evident in mixtures with faba beans. In field vegetable production with an abundant water and nutrient supply, the growth processes of C. album may be described quantitatively using simple functional relationships."

On the other hand, intercropping systems, also known as mixed cropping or polyculture, a traditional farming practice with diversified crop cultivation, uses comparatively low inputs and improves the quality of the agro-ecosystem. Intensification of crops can be done spatially and temporally by the adoption of the intercropping system targeting future need. Intercropping ensures multiple benefits like enhancement of yield, environmental security, production sustainability and greater ecosystem services. In intercropping, two or more crop species are grown concurrently as they coexist for a significant part of the crop cycle and interact among themselves and agro-ecosystems. Legumes as component crops in the intercropping system play versatile roles like biological N fixation and soil quality improvement, additional yield output including protein yield, and creation of functional diversity. But growing two or more crops together requires additional care and management for the creation of less competition among the crop species and efficient utilization of natural resources. Research evidence showed beneficial impacts of a properly managed intercropping system in terms of resource utilization and combined yield of crops grown with low-input use. The review highlights the principles and management of an intercropping system and its benefits and usefulness as a low-input agriculture for food and environmental security.

In this study, we deliver a whole-farm bio-economic analysis to assess the changes in land-use patterns, farm practices and on-farm GHG emissions under varying levels of agricultural abatement incentives in the form of a carbon tax for a broadacre farming system in Western Australia's Great Southern Region. Our results consistently indicate that an increase in agricultural carbon tax rate reduces both farm profits and on-farm GHG emissions. Since livestock are the dominant emissions source, the optimised enterprises mix would shift further towards cropping to produce less emissions. Under a carbon tax, farmers also tend to include less canola-based rotations and more field-pea-based rotations in their optimal enterprise mix. The estimates show that broadacre farmers in Western Australia may abate their on-farm emissions to help meet the national goal (13% reduction), with marginal abatement costs not higher than $20/ton CO2 equivalent in 2015 Australian dollars. In general, the analysis implies that abating broadacre agricultural GHG emissions through changing land-use patterns and farm management practices is relatively a low-cost choice.

Five date dual polarized Sentinel-1 DT classification was found to be optimum, as Bajra classification accuracy increased by 7.6% over four date. The improved Bajra accuracy of 85% was achieved when 2 date Sentinel-1was integrated with higher value quad polarized Radarsat-2 data. Similar structured crops like Sorghum and maize could be discriminated using difference in crop calendar and polarization response. Single date Sentinel-2 (near harvest stage as available) with 2 date Sentinel-1 yields 66% accuracy for Bajra crop but the attempt to extract temporal phenological profile was failed due to persistent cloud cover in the previous dates. Radarsat-2 data increased Bajra accuracy up to 89.5% when responsive polarimetric parameters were used in conjunction with multiple linear polarizations.

In this respect, one important location is the Hei River Basin (HRB), an ecotone in northwestern China where prehistoric patterns of cultivation are known to have changed significantly. To identify the factors behind the subsequent development of agriculture in the HRB in the historical period, a hitherto under-researched topic, we employed paleoclimate records, historical documents, radiocarbon dating, and archaeobotanical analyses from seven ancient cities and one large settlement. The results demonstrated a shift from mixed-crop farming to the cultivation of (mainly) barley and wheat during the Wei, Jin Northern and Southern dynasties, Song-Yuan and early Ming period, with the latter crop increasingly predominant. Technological innovations and increased labour power brought about by external population migration resulting from geopolitical changes in northern China were likely responsible for the shift in crop cultivation in the HRB, rather than climate change. This study provides important archaeobotanical evidence for the agricultural development of the HRB over the historical period and highlights multiple factors that seem to have influenced the evolution of agriculture in the region.

The results show a rapid and sustained population increase among a wide range of bird species, in contrast to local regional trends for the same species. Seventy percent of the increase occurred within the first 3 years of the experiment, with species of high conservation concern, and those monitored as environmental indicators on lowland farmland in the UK, increasing on average, by 30% and 20% respectively (reaching respective peaks of 44% and 33% after 4 years). For some individual species, the increase was higher still, i.e., 300% (1-4 pairs) for grey partridge (Perdix perdix) and 46% (13-19 pairs) for skylarks (Alauda arvensis) in peak years. The results demonstrate that bird species typical of lowland arable farmland in the UK are responsive to suitable farm-scale changes in habitat and food provision (roughly, manipulation within less than 1-km(2)). They show that the carrying capacity of modern, commercially viable, arable farmland can be increased significantly for birds, in this case, mainly by using crops mosaics to create habitats alongside the appropriate use of herbicides on non-cropped habitats.

Leigh; Reynolds, Travis W.; Biscaye, Pierre"			Methods of crop yield measurement on multi-cropped plots: Examples from Tanzania	FOOD SECURITY			English	Article						"Agricultural systems; Crop yield; Measurement; Tanzania"	"AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; FERTILIZER; MAIZE; INTENSIFICATION; AFRICA; COST"	Precise agricultural statistics are necessary to track productivity and design sound agricultural policies. Yet, in settings where multi-cropping is prevalent, even crop yield-perhaps the most common productivity metric-can be challenging to measure. In a survey of the literature on crop yield in low-income settings, we find that scholars specify how they estimate the area denominator used to measure yield in under 10% of cases. Using household survey data from Tanzania, we consider four alternative methods of allocating land area on multi-cropped plots, ranging from treatment of the entire plot as the yield denominator to increasingly precise approaches that account for the space taken up by other crops. We then explore the implications of this measurement decision for analyses of yield, focusing on one staple crop that is often grown on its own (rice) and one that is frequently found on mixed plots and in intercropped arrangements (maize). A majority (64%) of cultivated plots contain more than one crop, and average yield estimates vary with different methods of calculating area planted-particularly for maize. Importantly, the choice among area methods influences which of these two crops is found to be more calorie-productive per hectare. This choice also influences the statistically significant correlates of crop yield, such that the benefits of intercropping and including legumes on a maize plot are only evident when using an area measure that accounts for mixed cropping arrangements. We conclude that the literature would benefit from greater clarity regarding how yield is measured across studies.	"[Wineman, Ayala; Anderson, C.

Tillage history and crop residue input enhanced native carbon mineralisation and nutrient supply in contrasting soils under long-term farming systems	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH			English	Article						"Soil organic carbon priming; Plant available nutrient; C-13 isotope; Canola residue; Wheat residue"	"AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; ORGANIC-MATTER; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; EXTRACTION METHOD; DECOMPOSITION; NITROGEN; AVAILABILITY; MECHANISMS; SORPTION; PHOSPHORUS"	Understanding the legacy effect of tillage-based fanning systems on soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralisation and nutrient [nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sulphur (S)] supply after crop residue input is critical to appropriately manage plant available nutrients at the farm scale. To enhance this understanding, crop residues [canola (Brassica napus: delta C-13 124 parts per thousand) or wheat (Triticum aestivtan: delta C-13 461 parts per thousand)] were added to Luvisol and Vertisol from two long-term (16-46 years) field experiments and incubated under a controlled environment for 126 days. The practices in the Luvisol were conventional tillage (CT) and reduced tillage (RT) under mixed crop-pasture rotation, and no-till (NT) under continuous cereal-cover crop rotation. The practices in the Vertisol were CT and NT under wheat-wheat rotation. The residue input significantly stimulated SOC mineralisation via positive priming, which was greater (p < 0.05) in the CT than RT/NT in the Luvisol only. The SOC mineralised after 126 days was 3.1-4.2 and 1.6-2.5 times higher in the canola and wheat residue-amended soils, respectively, than the unamended soils. Although the CT or RT versus NT had higher net N availability in the Luvisol only, the residue input did not increase plant available N in both soils, possibly due to stronger residue-induced N immobilisation than mineralisation. The results showed a significant release of available P and S in both residueamended soils (canola > wheat) after 26-50% of residue-C was mineralised over 126 days, and the Vertisol had greater net available P than Luvisol. Our results suggest that considerable quantities of available P and S may release from the soil reserves via SOC priming, and possibly via dissolution/desorption reactions in the soils, in addition to their direct release from the residues. In conclusion, crop residue input to historical farming systems enhanced the supply of available P and S, which varied with tillage, crop residue and soil type.

Concentrations of selected heavy metals in soil were determined to carry out the environmental impact assessment of the orchard soils. The soils in Dashitong where 50-year-old trees are growing showed a clear tendency of Cu accumulation, and the simple pollution index was 0.45 for Cu as a whole. The Cd concentration exceeded the soil environmental standard in all soils to show the simple pollution index of 1.73. The overall pollution index of the soils was 1.27, which indicated the pollution status of slightly polluted in the orchard soils. In order to reduce the heavy metal concentration of the orchard soils, the mixed cropping with crops such as soybean is desirable to make absorption of heavy metals by the crops as much as possible, in addition to application of organic fertilizer of the environmental preservation type having no or safe-level heavy metal.

Residual effect and nitrate leaching in grass-arable rotations: effect of grassland proportion, sward type and fertilizer history	SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						"Residual nitrogen effect; nitrate leaching; soil C and N; grassland"	"DAIRY CROP-ROTATION; MANURE TYPE; NITROGEN DYNAMICS; MANAGEMENT; CLOVER; INPUT; CULTIVATION; PASTURES; QUALITY; LOSSES"	A key point in designing grass-arable rotations is to find the right balance between the number of cultivations and the length of the grass phase. In a field experiment, we investigated the effect of cropping history (grazed unfertilized grass-clover and fertilized [300 kg N per hectare] ryegrass, proportion of grassland and previous fertilizer use) on crop growth and nitrate leaching for 2 years following grassland cultivation. In the final year, the effect of perennial ryegrass as a catch crop was investigated. The nitrogen fertilizer replacement value (NFRV) of grassland cultivation was higher at 132 kg N per hectare in the rotation with 75% grassland compared with on average 111 kg N per hectare in rotations with 25 and 38% grassland and the NFRV of ryegrass in the rotation was higher than that of grass-clover. Nitrate leaching following cultivation was not affected by the proportion of grassland in the crop rotation or sward type. However, there was a considerable effect of having a ryegrass catch crop following the final barley crop as nitrate leaching was reduced from 60 to 9 kg N per hectare. When summarizing results from the crop rotations over a longer period (1997-2005), management strategy adopted in both the grassland and arable phases appeared to be the primary instrument in avoiding nutrient losses from mixed crop rotations, irrespective of grass proportion. In the arable phase, the huge potential of catch crops has been demonstrated, but it is also important to realize that all parts of the grass-arable crop rotations must be considered potentially leaky.

Conservation agriculture and direct seeding without tillage can meet this challenge. However, very few family farms adopt these techniques in these countries. This article aims to describe how and why farmers in the region of the Middle Sebou in Morocco have adopted direct sowing of rainfed crops. Interviews with farmers were undertaken and a few measurements of work and production costs were made. The analysis of the direct seeding process shows that farmers save both time and money for wheat implantation compared to seeding after tillage. The evolution of the direct seeding cropping system to a system of conservation agriculture with ground cover is complex and not possible for the moment due to the economic and social issues related to crop residues on mixed cropping/breeding farms. It is therefore not currently envisaged by farmers. Strengthening collective action seems important to ensure the sustainability of this experience (better organization of works, development of monitoring and evaluation, research and development, etc.)."

Informing climate adaptation pathways in multi-use woodland landscapes using the values-rules-knowledge framework	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"Agricultural landscapes; Biomass enterprises; Climate adaptation; Climate change; Decision context; Temperate eucalypt woodlands; Wheat-sheep belt"	"BROADACRE LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION; EUCALYPT WOODLANDS; BUFFEL GRASS; IMPACTS; CONSERVATION; PLANT; RESTORATION; CHALLENGES; RESPONSES; PASTURE"	"An emerging planning framework for climate adaptation focuses on interactions among societal values, institutional rules and scientific and experiential knowledge about biophysical impacts of climate change and adaptation options. These interactions shape the decision context that can enable or constrain effective adaptation. To illustrate the operationalisation of this 'values-rules-knowledge' (VRK) framework we developed biophysical adaptation pathways for agricultural landscapes of south-eastern Australia, which are expected to become warmer and drier under climate change. We used the VRK framework to identify potential constraints to implementing the pathways. Drawing on expert knowledge, published literature, biodiversity modelling and stakeholder workshops we identified potential adaptation pathways for (1) the production matrix, (2) high conservation value remnant eucalypt woodlands, and (3) woodland trees. Adaptation options included shifts from mixed cropping grazing to rangeland grazing or biomass enterprises; promoting re-assembly of native ecological communities; and maintaining ecosystem services and habitat that trees provide. Across all pathways, applying the VRK framework elucidated fifteen key implementation constraints, including limits to farm viability, decreasing effectiveness of environmental legislation and conflicting values about exotic plants. Most of the constraints involved interactions among VRK; 13 involved rules, eight involved values, and seven involved knowledge. Value constraints appeared most difficult to address, whereas those based on rules or knowledge were more tangible. The lower number of knowledge constraints may reflect the scale of our analysis (which focused on decision points in pre-defined pathways); new knowledge and participatory approaches would likely yield a richer set of scenarios. We conclude that the VRK framework helps connect the biophysical knowledge-based view of adaptation with a perspective on the need for changes in social systems, enabling targeting of constraints to adaptation. Our focus on pathways and decision points in different sectors of the multi-use landscape highlighted the importance of group and higher level planning and policy for balancing the collective outcomes of multiple decisions by many land managers.

Legume-grass intercrops are known to overyield because of legume nitrogen fixation. However, many agricultural soils are deficient in phosphorus. Here we show that a new mechanism of overyielding, in which phosphorus mobilized by one crop species increases the growth of a second crop species grown in alternate rows, led to large yield increases on phosphorus-deficient soils. In 4 years of field experiments, maize (Zea mays L.) overyielded by 43% and faba bean (Vicia faba Q overyielded by 26% when intercropped on a low-phosphorus but high-nitrogen soil. We found that overyielding of maize was attributable to belowground interactions between faba bean and maize in another field experiment. Intercropping with faba bean improved maize grain yield significantly and above-ground biomass marginally significantly, compared with maize grown with wheat, at lower rates of P fertilizer application (<75 kg Of P2O5 per hectare), and not significantly at high rate of P application (>112.5 kg Of P2O5 per hectare). By using permeable and impermeable root barriers, we found that maize overyielding resulted from its uptake of phosphorus mobilized by the acidification of the rhizosphere via faba bean root release of organic acids and protons. Faba bean overyielded because its growth season and rooting depth differed from maize. The large increase in yields from intercropping on low-phosphorus soils is likely to be especially important on heavily weathered soils.

The vegetation optical depth (VOD) parameter measures this attenuation. VOD could be a valuable source of information on agroecosystems, especially at lower frequencies for which greater portion of the vegetation canopy contributes to the observed brightness temperature. In the past, visible-infrared indices have been used to provide yield estimates based on measuring the photosynthetic activity from the surface canopy layer. These indices are affected by clouds and apply only in the presence of solar illumination. In this study we instead use the L-band microwave radiometer on board of the SMAP mission that provides VOD estimates in all weather and regardless of illumination. This study proposes a series of L-band VOD metrics for crop yield assessment using the first annual cycle of SMAP data (April 2015 to March 2016) over north-central United States. Maps of yield and crop proportion from the US Department of Agriculture are compared to VOD retrieved from SMAP with the Multi-Temporal Dual Channel Algorithm (MT-DCA). The yield-VOD relationship is explored using principal components regressions. Results show that 66% of yield variance is explained over the whole region by the first principal component (PC1). In corn-soy crops, PC1 explains 78% of yield amount, and maximum, standard deviation, and range of VOD capture the yield spatial patterns. Mixture of crops and scene heterogeneity reduced the unique relationships between VOD metrics and yield for specific crops. Hence, in wheat and mixed crops, PC1 explains 43% of yield variance. Results suggest that complementary information on maximum biomass, growth rate, and VOD amplitude can provide robust yield estimates, and that the uncertainty of these estimates depends on crop composition and heterogeneity. This study provides evidence that L-band VOD metrics can potentially be used to enhance crop yield forecasts.

However, many agricultural systems rely on crop residues for other uses, such as livestock feed, fuel, and construction material. This paper examines the key functions of crop residues in mixed crop-livestock farming systems and suggests alternatives to crop residues for sustaining agricultural productivity and natural resources. Various soil management and related practices allow crop residues to be removed without adversely affecting the soil environment. These include the introduction of alternative crop genotypes that produce both sufficient grain and residues of good quality; the partial rather than total removal of crop residues through selective crop residue harvest/return practices; provision and strategic use of chemical fertilizer and animal manure; substituting forages for crop residues; use of clean or reduced tillage; use of structural and support practices that complement tillage; and application of surface soil-amending materials. Not all practices are adaptable to all conditions, but one or more practices should be suitable for sustaining land productivity under most conditions where crop residues are limited or used for other purposes."

Thus, it is necessary to find sustainable alternatives to the conventional management for forage production in the Atlantic Arc dairy farms. Two alternative managements (faba bean in monoculture-FB-and faba bean-Italian ryegrass intercrop-FBIR) were cultivated with organic fertilization during two consecutive years, and compared to the conventional management (Italian ryegrass in monoculture-IR-under chemical fertilization) as winter crops. Maize was used as the summer crop to complete the rotations using organic and chemical fertilization, respectively. The forage yield of winter fodder was quantified. Soil samples and summer harvests were performed to analyse the physico-chemical and biological parameters. The best forage yield corresponded to FBIR with 9.2 t dry matter (DM) ha(-1) vs. 7.2 and 5.7 t DM ha(-1) for FB and IR, respectively. The soil organic matter did not show significant differences among treatments, suggesting that it may be a poor indicator of the management influence on edaphic quality in the short term. Biological indicators were more sensitive and faster to differentiate among managements than chemical indicators. Earthworm abundance was higher in FB and FBIR than IR (p < 0.001), and consequently, soil infiltration was improved with the alternative management (13.90 vs. 2.08 and 0.90 min for IR, FB and FBIR, respectively, p < 0.01). As a result, the soil health diagnosis of the agroecosystem was better for alternative management.

The objective of this study was to evaluate root morphological strategies of four crop species in response to soil zones enriched with different nutrients. Four crop species that are common in intercropping systems [maize (Zea mays L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), faba bean (Vicia faba L.), and chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.)] and have contrasting root morphological traits were grown for 45 days under uniform or localized nitrogen and phosphorus supply. For each species tested, the nutrient supply patterns had no effect on shoot biomass and specific root length. However, localized supply of ammonium plus phosphorus induced maize and wheat root proliferation in the nutrient-rich zone. Localized supply of ammonium alone suppressed the whole root growth of chickpea and maize, whereas localized phosphorus plus ammonium reversed (maize and chickpea ) the negative effect of ammonium. The localized root proliferation of chickpea in a nutrient-rich zone did not increase the whole root length and root surface area. Faba bean had no significant response to localized nutrient supply. The root morphological plasticity is influenced by nutrient-specific and species-specific responses, with the greater plasticity in graminaceous (eg. maize) than leguminous species (eg. faba bean and chickpea).

In this paper, we studied the crop portfolios that minimize energy and macronutrient deficiency. We accounted for yield variability, seasonality and storage availability. A mathematical programming approach was applied to four different farm types (based largely on farm size) to predict optimal mixes of crops for farmers to achieve the household year-round supply in calories, fats and proteins. The models predicted that farmers could best cover their household needs in terms of calories, fats and proteins by growing fewer crops in a more optimal combination. Bananas and cassava appear in the crop portfolios as sources of energy; growing beans add proteins to the diets and groundnuts and/or soybeans will supply the needed fats. Crop portfolios differ by farm type and change when yield variability and storage is accounted for. Some of the portfolios predicted by the models have a more diverse crop combination and include maize, rice and/or peas additional to the crops mentioned above. Results also highlighted the benefits of basic storage infrastructure in overcoming seasonal shortages. Nevertheless, even if they would choose to apply the proposed crop portfolios, farms with very small land size in Burundi will continue to struggle to supply sufficient food for the family. Further refinement for micronutrient supply, diet quality, food preferences and market purchases may change these findings."

Productivity, disease and pest descriptors at 50 Vicia faba genotypes of different biological status (10 obsolete cultivars, 30 local populations, 10 inbreed lines), were determined, by testing in intercropping experiments with small grain cereals and mono-cropping, in two different climatic years under the northeastern part of Romania conditions. The statistical estimators resulting from the unidirectional Anova analysis determined in mono-cropping and intercropping systems a hierarchy of heterogeneity of local populations for productivity traits and degree of attack of faba bean weevil (Bruchus rufimanus) and ascochyta blight (Ascochyta fabae) on seeds, for incidence of micromycete Uromyces viciae fabae and of aphids Aphys fabae in intercropping system. There was a weak competition of Vicia faba species, regarding the presence of weeds compared to small grains cereals variants and potentially beneficial for nitrogen symbiotic fixation by increasing oat productivity, in two years of intercropping with faba bean. By using Euclidean distance and Pearson correlation, in classification of genotypes and morpho-productive traits, diseases and pest in clusters from dendograms, similarities were highlighted between productivity and its components and between attacks to diseases and pests and dissimilarities between genotypes, members cluster three with phenotypic variability with maximum values of productivity traits and minimum attacks to disease and pest resistance compared to the other two clusters with possibilities for use in the development of genetic mixtures programs.

The MOMOS (microorganisms and organic matter of soils) model integrates simplified descriptions of photosynthesis (origin of organic C in soil), N microbial exchange (soil origin for N), N fixation (atmospheric origin for N), and plant growth with an organic matter decomposition core that has the soil microbial community at its center. This work provides estimates of the exchange parameters between plant organs and microbes, which were compared to literature data when available. In a connection with photosynthesized C, the root demand for inorganic N can be adjusted by its microbial production. Our approach is a new methodology for improving plant production, by optimizing the interactions with soil microorganisms. Additionally, the coupling of plant growth and microbial processes enabled determining changes of the organic compartments of soil. In the unfertilized limestone soil of this study, sequestration was found to be located in the labile microbial metabolites for one year, then significantly transferred to stable humus during 6-year intercropping. Thus, we propose the MOMOS mathematical tool, not only for guiding ecological intensification, but also related to the management of agroecosystems for climate change mitigation.

There is however considerable regional variation in the dominant type of crop residue: rice and wheat straws in irrigated regions compared to coarse cereal straws and hay from leguminous crops in the drier, semi-arid regions. This paper synthesizes a series of recent studies on the role and importance of crop residues and farmers' perceptions of fodder quantity and quality in coarse cereal and groundnut based feeding systems. Crop improvement programs for sorghum, pearl millet and groundnut have traditionally focused on grain/pod yield improvement, pest and water stress tolerance. Only relatively recently have dual-purpose (grain and fodder) plant types been developed. While the nutritive value of fodder from dual-purpose crops can be determined through in vivo and in vitro analysis, such experimental procedures cannot necessarily capture the often-subjective quality attributes that farmers (and their animals) value. Results indicate that farmers perceive a range of quality traits, some of which could be screened for relatively easily, whereas others may be more difficult to assess. These findings highlight the importance of farmer participatory evaluation of fodder traits in the development of improved dual-purpose varieties. However the impact of these varieties on poor farm households will be contingent on the complementary improvement in the effectiveness of seed systems. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Associating cereals and legume production either through intercropping or rotations might be a relevant strategy of producing both type of culture, while benefiting from combined nitrogen fixed by the legume through its symbiotic association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and from a better use of P and water through mycorrhizal associations. These practices also participate to the diversification of agricultural productions, enabling to secure the regularity of income returns across the seasonal and climatic uncertainties. In this context, we designed a field experiment aiming to estimate the 2 years impact of these practices on wheat yield and on soil microbial activities as estimated through Substrate Induced Respiration method and mycorrhizal soil infectivity (MSI) measurement. It is expected that understanding soil microbial functionalities in response to these agricultural practices might allows to target the best type of combination, in regard to crop productivity. We found that the tested cropping systems largely impacted soil microbial functionalities and MSI. Intercropping gave better results in terms of crop productivity than the rotation practice after two cropping seasons. Benefits resulting from intercrop should be highly linked with changes recorded on soil microbial functionalities.

Efficient use of soil water is, therefore, paramount in crop production. Two 2-yr field studies were conducted (i) to determine the effects of crop selection and cropping practice on the temporal and spatial distribution of soil water and (ii) to quantify water use and water-use efficiencies (WUE) of alternative crop/cropping systems for a subhumid region of Alberta. The first study was at the Ellerslie Research Station on an Orthic Black Chemozemic and the second at the University of Alberta Breton Plots on an Orthic Gray Luvisol. At each site three annual crops/cropping systems [barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), barley intercropped with field pea (Pisum sativum L.), and faba bean (Vicia faba L.) ] and a perennial forage [creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra)] were grown in 1987 and in 1988. At Ellerslie, tillage methods to grow annual crops were conventional and zero tillage. At Breton, the two tillage methods used were: (i) conventional and (ii) deep tillage (to enrich the surface horizon with clay from the subsoil). The experimental design used was a split plot with four replications. Soil water was measured by neutron attenuation. Evapotranspiration was calculated as the change in soil water to 0.80-m depth plus precipitation. Soil water changes were more closely associated with the kind of crop grown than with the method of tillage used. The barley/field pea intercrop exhibited a pattern of water use similar to barley. Greater water-use efficiency measured in the intercrop system was attributed to differences in canopy structure and plant biomass production. Faba bean and red fescue had lower WUE than barley and the intercrop. The water requirement by faba bean was close to that of red fescue and related to leaf area development. Small tillage effects on soil water were observed during 1988. Soil water under zero tillage was greater than under conventional tillage. Faba bean and red fescue are likely to succeed more in agro-ecological regions such as Breton. Further studies are required to improve our understanding of the effects of these cropping systems on water resources when they are used in rotational-production systems.

Hydrothermal effects on the performance of maize and cucumber intercrop in a tropical wet and dry climate in Nigeria	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						"Hydrothermal; agro-meteorological; precipitation"	"POLLEN SEASON; TEMPERATURE"	Maize and cucumber were intercropped in a simple randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replicates in two field trials in early and late planting seasons of 2004. The result showed that mean soil temperatures of 33 and 31 degrees C at 5 and 10 cm respectively during late season could be said to have enhanced the productivity of cucumber yield by about 50% compared to early season with mean soil temperatures of 30 and 29 degrees C at 5 and 10 cm below soil surface. The mean cucumber yield of 9 t/ha and 6.1 t/ha for mono and mixed crop respectively during early season trial was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than the mean cucumber yield of 15.34 t/ha and 12.34 t/ha for late season. However, early season maize fresh cob weight (178.4 g/ha) and weight of seeds per cob (122.4 g/ha) were significantly higher than that recorded for late season with 152.2 g/ha and 64.1 g/ha respectively. This could be attributed to suitably high rainfall of 27.0 and 324.6 mm during establishment and vegetative phenological stages respectively during the early cropping season compared with corresponding values of 12.6 and 206.5 mm during late season trial.

The organic farm had been cultivated according to the principles of Steiner (1963) since 1952. The sites were similar with respect to climatic conditions, soil type and vegetation. There was no difference in the total number of antagonistic fungi isolated from the two differently cultivated fields, but the results for Fusarium spp. showed effects of the actual crop as well as the cropping system. Soil sampling over a three year period at the organically cultivated farm in two crops - winter wheat or a mixture of grass and clover shouted almost twice as many species of Fusarium in the mixed crop compared to monoculture. In mixed crop fields, the percentage of F. culmorum in relation to total isolations of fusaria was 20% in the organically cultivated field compared with 45% in the conventionally cultivated field. These results indicate that pathogenic fusaria may be suppressed by antagonistic fusaria to a larger extent in the organically cultivated field than in the conventionally cultivated field. In accordance with this, a higher number of antagonistic fusaria was found in the organically farmed field (14) compared to three in the conventionally farmed field. This was partly a result of a higher number of isolated fusaria and a higher number of different species of Fusarium in the organically cultivated soil (total number of non-pathogenic fusaria was 10 in the conventionally cultivated field and 56 in the organically cultivated field). However, it also seems to reflect an enrichment of fusaria with antagonistic properties towards F. culmorum. Thus, the occurrence of F. culmorum was 1.7 times higher in the organically cultivated field while the occurrence of its antagonists was 4.6 times higher in the organically compared with the conventionally cultivated field.

Conservation Agriculture Enhances Soil Fauna Richness and Abundance in Low Input Systems: Examples From Kenya	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						"tillage; organic resources; soil fauna; richness; abundance"	"ORGANIC-MATTER DYNAMICS; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; FERTILITY MANAGEMENT; AGGREGATION; MACROFAUNA; TILLAGE; INTENSIFICATION; BIODIVERSITY; QUALITY; CARBON"	Conservation agriculture (CA) (zero tillage + organic inputs as surface residue) is believed to improve soil nutrient status, soil structure, control soil erosion, and also enhance soil fauna diversity. Despite the widespread interest in CA, empirical evidence of the benefits of CA on soil fauna diversity is limited, especially in low-input systems of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Consequently, the magnitude and effect by CA on soil fauna remains unquantified. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of CA and associated management practices on soil fauna richness and abundance. We hypothesized that CA and mixed cropping would positively influence soil fauna richness and abundance. We compared CA with conventional till (CT: with or without residues) in sole maize and maize-bean cropping systems. Soil macrofauna and mesofauna were sampled across the treatments in medium-term (6 years) trials in Embu, Central Kenya, and Kakamega (6 years) and a long-term trial in Nyabeda (15 years) using soil monoliths and core samplers, respectively. In agreement with our hypothesis, higher macrofauna taxonomic richness and mesofauna was recorded in CA than in CT without residues. This study demonstrated that: (1) medium to long-term addition of organic residues enhances soil fauna richness and abundance, (2) CA increases soil fauna taxonomic richness and abundance compared with CT, and (3) CA under maize-bean intercropping, rotation and sole maize cropping systems promote soil fauna richness and abundance compared with sole legume (common beans). We conclude that adoption of CA is important in enhancing richness of soil fauna. Given the numerous challenges faced by smallholder farmers of SSA in the adoption of CA, who in most cases rarely practice all the three CA principles simultaneously, we propose a further study that will determine the effects and interactions between each of the CA components on soil fauna richness and abundance.

It has been studied as a characteristic of plant genotypes grown singly or in monoculture crop stands. However, it is similarly valid as a characteristic of ecosystems, or mixtures / inter-cropping in crops and this paper seeks to evaluate theoretical and practical aspects of tolerance in this context. Focusing on cereals and fungal pathogens, consideration is given to the process of yield formation, the impact of disease on yield, and how tolerance might be assessed in monocultures. Variation in tolerance traits in monocultures and how such plants might interact in mixtures is considered; specifically the expression of tolerance in mixtures and how plants with contrasting tolerance traits in monocultures combine. Having focused on disease, further consideration is given to the impact of and on other microbial species in the crop environment. Finally the practical approaches that could be adopted to identify and assess the main traits responsible for expressing tolerance are addressed. These focus on the dynamic nature of plant-plant and plant-microbe interactions particularly in response to both biotic and abiotic stress out with the range of optimal or normal crop evaluation environments. It is proposed that by using more extreme factor parameter values in mixed crop evaluation environments the key traits affecting tolerance will be identified."

However, it is difficult to disentangle the effects of intensive monoculture (e.g. pesticide use, mechanical ploughing and reduced protective cover), let alone evaluate how far the reduction of crop diversity affects biodiversity. It remains unclear to which extent the consequent decrease in food resources affects farmland biodiversity, and particularly vertebrate species. We therefore designed this study in mesocosms to investigate the effects of monoculture crops (organic wheat or corn seeds) and mixed crops (a combination of organic wheat, corn, sunflower and alfalfa seeds) on (1) the species richness of weeds and invertebrates and (2) the reproductive success of the European hamster (Cricetus cricetus), a critically endangered umbrella species of European farmlands. We found a negative impact of organic monoculture crops on plant and invertebrate species richness, with values respectively 38% and 28% lower than those obtained for mixed organic crops. The reproductive success of hamsters was reduced by 82% in monoculture mesocosms. These results highlight that monoculture per se can be detrimental for farmland biodiversity (i.e. from plants to vertebrates), even before taking into account the use of pesticide and mechanization. We believe that future research should further consider how food reduction in agroecosystems affects farmland wildlife, including vertebrates. Moreover, we argue that conservation actions must focus on restoring plant diversity on farmland to reverse the observed trend in farmland wildlife decline.

The accumulation of total protein and specific protein fractions in the grain of eight Italian durum wheat cultivars grown as sole crop (SC) or intercropped with legume until durum wheat shooting were compared. Gluten quality was also examined. Analysis of variance indicated that gluten quality, total protein concentration, and monomeric and polymeric protein amounts were significantly higher in intercrops than in SCs whereas the grain yield was significantly higher in the SC. Significant cultivarxtreatment interactions were observed for most of the tested parameters. PCA allowed the visualization of the genotypes able to use the higher N availability coming from the temporary intercropping to achieve the grain protein concentration of 14.1% dry matter, the threshold considered suitable by the industry for producing high quality pasta. In addition, one such genotypes also showed good grain yield, with the highest values in the temporary intercrop. The results suggested that the durum wheat-faba bean temporary intercropping could be an agronomic strategy for improving the grain quality of the cereal under organic management and, as a consequence, it may be expected to have a positive impact on the durum wheat end-product quality.

The assessment of species specific root distribution in intercrops was limited so far because of the difficulties to identify roots on a species level. We investigated horizontal and vertical root distribution of eight winter faba bean genotypes (Vicia faba L.) and one winter wheat cultivar (Triticum aestivum L.) grown in sole stands and in 50/50 substitutive row intercrops. Root samples were taken within and between rows with a root auger down to 60 cm soil depth in May 2015 and May 2016 at a field site in central Germany. We used Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for root species identification. Vertical root distribution was described by the equation y = 1 -beta(d) according to Gale and Grigal (1987). Horizontal root distribution did not differ between bean and wheat and between sole stands and intercrops averaged across the eight bean genotypes: Bean and wheat root biomass was on average 65% lower between rows than within rows in sole stands and in intercrops. Both species proliferated into the soil space between the rows and into the intercropping partner's row to a similar extent. Bean developed 36% of its root biomass in 0-10 cm soil depth, while wheat had 51%. Bean and wheat had shallower roots within their own row in intercrops (beta(b)(ean) = 0.933 ; beta(wheat)=0.858) compared to their own row in sole stands (beta(b)(ean)= 0.945; beta(wheat)= 0.902). In the intercrops both species occupied deeper soil layers within their partner's row (beta(b)(ean)= 0.947; beta(wheat) = 0.960) compared to their own row ( beta(b)(ean)= 0.933; beta(wheat) = 0.858). This change in vertical root distribution was more pronounced for wheat than for bean. Bean genotypes grown in sole stands did not differ in their horizontal and vertical root distribution. However, there were significant differences between bean genotypes within wheat rows in the intercrops: bean genotype Vf6 had the largest horizontal spread but the most shallow root growth within the wheat row, while Vf5 showed the lowest horizontal spread and the highest root fractions in deep soil layers within the wheat row.

Based on the plant-soil feedback (PSF) theory and method, we quantified to what extent and how soil microbes contributed to intercropping overyielding. Soils were collected as inocula and sequenced from a unique 10-year field experiment, consisting of monoculture, intercropping and rotation planted with wheat (Triticum aestivum), maize (Zea mays) or faba bean (Vicia faba). A PSF greenhouse study was conducted to test microbial effects on three crops' growth in monoculture or intercropping. In wheat & faba bean (W&F) and maize & faba bean (M&F) systems, soil microbes drove intercropping overyielding compared to monoculture, with 28%-51% of the overyielding contributed by microbial legacies. The overyielding effects resulted from negative PSFs in both systems, as crops, in particular faba bean grew better in soils conditioned by other crops than itself. Moreover, faba bean grew better in soils from intercropping or rotation than from the average of monocultures, indicating a strong positive legacy effect of multispecies cropping systems. However, with positive PSF and negative legacy benefit effect of intercropping/rotation, we did not observe significant overyielding in the W&M system. With more bacterial and fungal dissimilarities by metabarcoding in heterospecific than its own soil, the better it improved faba bean growth. More detailed analysis showed faba bean monoculture soil accumulated more putative pathogens with higher Fusarium relative abundance and more Fusarium oxysporum gene copies by qPCR, while in heterospecific soils, there were less pathogenic effects when cereals were engaged. Further analysis in maize/faba bean intercropping also showed an increase of rhizobia relative abundance. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate a soil microbiome-mediated advantage in intercropping through suppression of the negative PSF of pathogens and increasing beneficial microbes. As microbial mediation of overyielding is context-dependent, we conclude that the dynamics of both beneficial and pathogenic microbes should be considered in designing cropping systems for sustainable agriculture, particularly including combinations of legumes and cereals.

At national level, more than half of the females are either overweight or obese, while children suffer from under-nutrition. Childhood malnutrition starts early in life, with the first two years being the most vulnerable period. Chronic malnutrition (as indicated by the prevalence of stunting) is a bigger problem than acute malnutrition (as indicated by the prevalence of wasting). Stunted children have a higher risk for being overweight. At national level, 33.3% of preschool children are vitamin A deficient, 21.4% are anaemic and 5.0% suffer from iron deficiency anaemia. Prevalence figures for childhood malnutrition differ between and within provinces. South African children consume a maize-based diet that is inadequate in energy and of low nutrient density. Inadequate intake of micronutrients starts during infancy. Strategies to address micronutrient malnutrition include high-dose vitamin A supplementation, food fortification, biofortification and dietary diversification. The availability of a greater variety of nutritious foods at community and household level can be increased through mixed cropping, the introduction of new crops, the promotion of underexploited traditional food crops, and home-gardens. A broad multifaceted comprehensive health intervention programme is needed to address childhood malnutrition.

Banker plant systems are becoming a more common form of biological control for this pest. This system consists of grain banker plants infested with R. padi, an alternative hosts for the parasitoid Aphidius colemani. Thus A. colemani can reproduce on the banker plant when M. persicae populations are low. This system can increase pest suppression; however, like other biological control tools, efficacy is inconsistent. One reason is because several different grain species have been used. Our studies determined if there were benefits to planting interspecific mixture banker plants, similar to when open agricultural systems use mixed cropping. Our study found that although banker plants grow larger when planted as mixtures this added plant growth does not increase in the number of aphids, or mummies an individual banker plant can sustain. Rye banker plants grew larger, and sustained more mummies than the other species we tested, but barley banker plants resulted in a similar number of aphids in a more condensed area. Ultimately, we did not see any differences in pest suppression between monoculture banker plants, mixture banker plants, or our augmentative release treatment. However, using banker plants resulted in more female parasitoids than the augmentative release, a benefit to using banker plant systems."

Relatively little is known regarding R anamictus, R brevitubulus, R. clavicaudatus; R leptus, and R sacchari. Rotylenchulus reniformis and R parvus both appear to have a cosmopolitan distribution in warm latitudes; R. borealis, so far, has been reported primarily from Europe and Africa; R macrodoratus and R. macrosoma have been found primarily in the Mediterranean region. There are clear anatomical differences in the trophic site induced by R macrodoratus (uninucleate giant cell) compared to those induced by R. borealis, R. macrosoma, R parvus, and R reniformis (syncytia). There also are differences in the abilities of these species to parasitize various hosts. Rotylenchulus reniformis appears to have the widest host range and has been reported to reproduce on 86% of 364 plant species examined. Many common weeds are good hosts. However, more than 50 crop or ornamental plants support little or no reproduction by most populations of R reniformis. Examples include barley, maize, onion, rice, several crotalaria species, and resistant cultivars of soybean. Varying levels of resistance also have been found in cotton, olive, papaya, potato, sweet potato, tobacco, tomato, and various legumes.

The traditional knowledge in small scale economy societies as well as the non-academic knowledge in urban-industrial societies might be included in this concept. An ethnoecological approach study was performed here on people living at the communities of Alvinho, Almeida, Cha do Marinho, Floriano, and Cha de Oiti, all located in the municipality of Lagoa Seca, Paraiba state, Northeast Brazil. The general objective pursued here was to study the knowledge that peasant farmers have on management of plant species utilized for pest control. For this, the methodological instruments employed here to investigate the ethnoecological knowledge were: direct observation, structured and semi-structured interviews, and tours conducted by local peasant farmers. We analyzed the data obtained under an emic/etic view and also by comparing the local knowledge with those obtained from the literature. The results showed that people in those communities utilize management alternatives for controlling pests, which are mainly: (i) fallowing; (ii) crop rotation; (iii) destruction of crop remains and fruits attacked by pests; (iv) alternations of crops with repellent plants; and/or (v) mixed cropping; (vi) insect's larvae covered with soil; (vii) crops irrigated abundantly; and (viii) soil preparation. The recovery and comprehension we get about this knowledge as well as the farmers' savoir faire, are extremely important to the revival of ancient agricultural practices, which have been forgotten due to advances in modern agriculture. The data obtained here showed that a huge body of knowledge the farmers have on many forms or strategies of management are generally compatible with scientific knowledge."

Today in China, the spatiotemporal patterns of eWUE and responses to drought across different cropland classes remain poorly quantified. In this study, we characterized the spatial temporal variability in cropland eWUE and response to drought in China from 1982 to 2017 using the satellite-retrieved evapotranspiration (ET), gross primary production (GPP), and self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI), in conjunction with the Global Food Security-support Analysis Data product for Crop Dominance (GFSAD1KCD) data. Results indicated that (1) mean annual cropland eWUE had a spatial range from 0 to 9.94 g C kg(-1) H2O, with higher values (2.06 g C kg(-1) H2O) in class 4 (rainfed: wheat, rice, and soybeans dominant), whereas the lowest eWUE (1.58 g C kg(-1) H2O) occurred in class 2 (irrigated mixed crop 1: wheat, rice, barley, and soybeans). (2) Annual eWUE, GPP, and ET values for croplands in China increased significantly between 1982 and 2017. Class 1 (irrigated wheat and rice) had the highest trend of 0.011 g C kg(-1) H2O yr(-1), and class 6 (rainfed: corn and soybeans) had the lowest of 0.0007 g C kg(-1) H2O yr(-1). Apart from class 4, annual GPP and ET were enhanced in most cropland classes from 1982 to 2017 (p<0.01). (3) Rainfed croplands generally had higher eWUE, GPP, and ET values than irrigated croplands. Except for rainfed cropland eWUE, all other cropland variables increased significantly (p<0.001) from 1982 to 2017. (4) Correlation analysis found that the 19.66% (15.62%) of cropland had significant negative (positive) correlations between eWUE and current-year scPDSI. The legacy effects of drought on cropland eWUE indicated that previous and current-year drought impacts on cropland eWUE were in the same direction. Our results provide insights into variability in cropland eWUE and its response to drought in China, where there is a growing demand for agricultural water resource management.

Notwithstanding a growing body of data, its timing, pace, and pathway of dispersal as well as social impact in China continue to be debated. Here, we present one more line of direct evidence for early occurrence of bread wheat at the coastal site of Sujiacun in the Rizhao area of southeastern Shandong Province, China. Our results by direct dating of a mixed crop cohort consistently show that bread wheat was first introduced into the eastern Chinese coast about 2460-2210 BC. The directly dated wheat grain at Sujiacun is coeval with those found at the Zhaojiazhuang site. Our finding implies that there may have been more than one possible route for wheat transmission to China, including the Eurasian Steppe route. Given the coastal location of the two Shandong sites yielding early wheat remains, however, a trans-Asian dispersal including ocean travel cannot be excluded. Comparison with existing data suggests that, upon arrival on the coast of eastern Shandong, bread wheat quickly dispersed inland and arrived in the Central China Plain and North China Plain by about 2000 BC. It appears that bread wheat was not cultivated extensively in Shandong until hundreds of years later, perhaps due to limitations of climatic, technological, and/or social factors.

We used partial land equivalent ratios (LERs) to assess the mixing ability of a genotype defined as the combination of its ability to maintain its own yield in intercropping (producer effect, LERw) and to let the mixed species produce (associate effect, LERl). Eight wheat genotypes and 5 legume testers (3 pea and 2 faba bean varieties) were grown in sole crop and in all possible binary intercrops in nine contrasting environments. A mixed model was used to evaluate the effects of wheat genotypes, legume testers, environments, and all the interactions among these 3 factors on LERw and LERl. The chosen wheat genotypes presented contrasting mixing ability, either in terms of producer effect (LERw) or associate effect (LERl). A strong negative correlation was observed between these two components of genotype mixing ability, with an increase in producer effect being generally associated with similar decrease in associate effect, except for three genotypes. The impact of environment on the producer and associate effects was limited and similar between genotypes. Legume tester had a significant effect on both LERw and LERl, making the choice of tester a major issue to reveal the producer or associate effects of wheat genotype. Although the 5 testers showed no significant differences in wheat genotype order for both producer or associate effects, they showed different competitiveness and ability to discriminate genotypes: faba bean was very competitive, resulting in low LERt and low capacity to discriminate wheat genotypes for their mixing ability. On the contrary, pea was less competitive, resulting in higher LERt and better capacity to discriminate wheat genotypes. In particular, the Hr varieties (Geronimo and Spencer) discriminated best the wheat genotypes. Consequences on the implementation of breeding programs for wheat varieties adapted to intercropping are discussed.

Influence of growth stage and seed nitrogen on B values and potential contributions to error in estimating biological N-2 fixation using the N-15 natural abundance method	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						"Chickpea; Faba bean; Field pea; Intercropping; Lupin"	"VICIA-FABA L.; ISOTOPIC FRACTIONATION; LEGUMES; SYSTEMS; CHICKPEA; PLANT; SOIL; DYNAMICS; PASTURES; BENEFITS"	Aims The N-15 natural abundance technique is increasingly being used to biological nitrogen (N-2) fixation by legume crops, but requires the determination of a 'B value' which describes the isotopic fractionation for a given plant species and strain of rhizobium. Most B values in the literature are derived for shoot tissue harvested at mid pod filling, when plant N content is generally at its maximum. However, if legumes are grown as green manure inter-crops and growth is terminated at earlier stages, to obtain accurate values for total N-2 fixed growth-stage specific B values and correction for seed N contributions may be necessary. This study aimed to evaluate the magnitude of the impact of different values of the N content and N-15 abundance of seeds and of B values on the estimates of the proportion of legume N derived from N-2 fixation. Methods We investigated whether B values at pod filling differ from those at earlier growth stages by growing chickpea (Cicer arietinum), white lupin (Lupinus albus), field pea (Pisum sativum) and two faba bean (Vicia faba) cultivars, in sand-culture in a glasshouse without N, and quantifying the delta N-15 values of nodules, roots and shoots at five growth stages including mid pod filling as a control. We then used simulations to investigate the degree of error associated with the use of growth stage-inappropriate or B values uncorrected for seed N on estimates of % N derived from atmosphere (%Ndfa). Results While the differences in B values between flowering and pod filling were only statistically significant at P < 0.1 for white lupin, there was a trend of declining B value with plant age for chickpea and faba beans. Simulations using data from large (Aguadulce) and small (Fiesta)-seeded faba bean cultivars indicated that the magnitude of potential errors in estimating %Ndfa using B values derived at inappropriate growth stages or uncorrected for seed N content were around 10% at early flowering in both faba bean cultivars and were negligible by late flowering (69 days after sowing). Conclusions Where legumes are grown until flowering or beyond, the magnitude of potential error in estimation of %Ndfa from the use of B values derived at inappropriate growth stages or uncorrected for seed N content is relatively low compared to other sources of error encountered when employing the N-15 natural abundance technique.

Community-based alternative breeding plans for indigenous sheep breeds in four agro-ecological zones of Ethiopia	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL BREEDING AND GENETICS			English	Article						"Breeding plans; deterministic modelling; Ethiopia; pastoralists; sheep; smallholders"	"AUSTRALIAN BEEF-CATTLE; SELECTION; SCHEMES; REPRODUCTION; POPULATION; PARAMETERS; PROGRAMS; TRAITS; WEIGHT; TRENDS"	Based on the results of participatory approaches to define traits in the breeding objectives, four scenarios of ram selection and ram use were compared via deterministic modelling of breeding plans for community-based sheep breeding programmes in four diverse agro-ecological regions of Ethiopia. The regions (and production systems) were Afar (pastoral/agro-pastoral), Bonga and Horro (both mixed crop-livestock) and Menz (sheep-barley). The schemes or scenarios differed in terms of selection intensity and duration of ram use. The predicted genetic gains per year in yearling weight (kilograms) were comparable across the schemes but differed among the breeds and ranged from 0.399 to 0.440 in Afar, 0.813 to 0.894 in Bonga, 0.850 to 0.940 in Horro, and 0.616 to 0.699 in Menz. The genetic gains per year in number of lambs born per ewe bred ranged from 0.009 to 0.010 in both Bonga and Horro. The predicted genetic gain in the proportion of lambs weaned per ewe joined was nearly comparable in all breeds ranging from 0.008 to 0.011. The genetic gain per year in milk yield of Afar breed was in the order of 0.018 to 0.020 kg, while the genetic gain per generation for greasy fleece weight (kg) ranged from 0.016 to 0.024 in Menz. Generally, strong selection and shorter duration of ram use for breeding were the preferred options. The expected genetic gains are satisfactory but largely rely on accurate and continuous pedigree and performance recording.

ASSESSING LIVESTOCK WATER PRODUCTIVITY IN MIXED FARMING SYSTEMS OF GUMARA WATERSHED, ETHIOPIA	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article							CATTLE	"A monitoring study was carried out in Gumara watershed, upper Blue Nile basin, with the objective of evaluating livestock water productivity (LWP) using a life cycle assessment method. Sixty two smallholder farmers were selected for the study implemented between November 2006 and February 2008. Data on crop and livestock production were collected to allow assessment of livestock water productivity. Study sites were situated in three different rainfed mixed crop/livestock farming systems; barley/potato based system (BPS), tef/finger-millet based system (TMS), and rice/noug based system (RNS). LWP was found to be significantly lower (p < 0.01) in RNS (0.057 USD m(-3) water) than in TMS (0.066 USD in water) or in BPS (0.066 USD m(-3) water). Notably, water requirement per kg live weight of cattle increased towards the lower altitude area (in RNS) mainly because of increased evapo-transpiration. As a result, 20% more water was required per kg live weight of cattle in the low ground RNS compared to BPS situated in the upstream parts of the study area. Cattle herd management that involved early offtake increased LWP by 28% over the practice of late offtake. Crop water productivity expressed in monetary units (0.39 USD m(-3) water) was higher than LWP (0.063 USD m(-3) water) across the mixed farming systems of Gumara watershed. Strategies for improving LWP, from its present low level, could include keeping only the more productive animals, increasing pasture productivity and linking production to marketing. These strategies would also ease the imbalance between the existing high livestock population and the declining carrying capacity of natural pasture."

The objective of this study was to maximize annual dry matter (DM) yield by optimizing sowing and harvest dates. Forage crop options include faba bean, oats and Italian ryegrass. These were sown on five dates in the autumn and winter of 2008 and on three sowing dates in the autumn of 2009. The maximum total DM ranged from 4420 to 26,310 kg ha(-1) across all species and sowing dates for both seasons. Oats yielded the highest maximum total DM in both years. The quality analysis showed oats sown in early March and harvested at the end of August attained herbage metabolisable energy (ME) of 11.5 MJ kg(-1) DM and high total ME per ha which was suitable for the lactation of dairy cows. Thus, oats was the beneficial alternative forage crop for farmers to choose. Faba bean had lowest maximum total DM yield compared with oats and Italian ryegrass in the first season; however, faba bean had higher maximum total DM compared with Italian ryegrass but lower than oats and faba bean-oat intercrop in the second season. Faba bean sown from early March to mid-April and harvested at the end of November attained a herbage nitrogen (N) content of more than 2.4% and had the highest total N uptake per ha compared with oats and Italian ryegrass at 2.4% of herbage N."

Economic analysis of on-farm adaptive research trials for rice-maize intercrops in the Guinea Savannah: Case study of Kwara State, Nigeria	RESEARCH ON CROPS			English	Article						"Ecological zones; marginal rate of returns; partial budget; profitability"		Maize and rice are two important cereals that have been identified by the Food and Agricultural Organisation as crops capable of remedying food insecurity situations in the developing nations, especially in sub-saharan Africa. However, rice and sometimes maize are usually cultivated as sole crops. Though monocropping results in high outputs, the greatest disadvantage of sole cropping is that in instances of pest or disease outbreaks that attacks the sole crop, the farmer usually looses a significant part of his crops and sometimes even looses all his crops. The crop mixture/intercrop form of producing crops is therefore preferred by farmers, as it insures them against total crop losses. However, producing crops under different mixed cropping conditions will definitely have impact on resource use and consequently crops' yields. This study therefore evaluated an on-farm adaptive research trial for the rice-maize intercrops in Kwara state, Nigeria. This was with a view to formulating a profitable intercrop farming practice for these crops. Data for the study were sourced from four treatments of maize-rice intercrops in each of the four ecological zones (A-D) of the Kwara state Agricultural Development Project (KWADP). The four maize-rice treatments were Faro 43 rice-maize at 90 x 80 cm and one plant/stand seed rate as the control (T), Faro 43 rice-maize at 90 x 40 cm and one plant/stand seed rate (T 2), Faro 43 rice-maize at 90 x 50 cm and two plants/stand seed rate (T(3)) and Faro 43 rice-maize at 90 x 40 cm and two plants/stand seed rate (T(4)) The control treatment is the prevalent rice-maize intercrop practice in the study area. The partial budget and marginal rate of return analyses were used in determining the profitability of each treatment. The partial budget result indicated that treatment 3 (T(3)) has the highest average net benefit within and across the KWADP ecological zones. Also the marginal rate of returns showed that treatments 3 has the highest marginal rate of return within and across the zones. The study therefore recommends treatment 3 to farmers in the savannah zones of Nigeria.	"[Fakayode, S. B.; Muhammad-Lawal, A.; Omotesho, A. O.; Solomon, M.

Exploiting phytochemicals for developing a 'push-pull' crop protection strategy for cereal farmers in Africa	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY			English	Review						"Allelochemicals; cereals; push-pull; semiochemicals; stemborer; Striga"	"PENNISETUM-PURPUREUM VARIETIES; STRIGA-HERMONTHICA; CHILO-PARTELLUS; INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT; CHEMICAL ECOLOGY; BUSSEOLA-FUSCA; DESMODIUM SPP.; ROOT EXUDATE; TRAP PLANTS; STEMBORERS"	Lepidopteran stemborers and parasitic weeds in the genus Striga are major constraints to efficient production of cereals, the most important staple food crops in Africa. Smallholder farmers are resource constrained and unable to afford expensive chemicals for crop protection. Development of a push-pull approach for integrated pest and weed management is reviewed here. Appropriate plants were discovered that naturally emit signalling chemicals (semiochemicals). Plants highly attractive for egg laying by stemborer pests were selected and employed as trap crops (pull), to draw pests away from the main crop. Of these, Napier grass, Pennisetum purpureum (Schumach), despite its attractiveness, supported minimal survival of the pests' immature stages. Plants that repelled stemborer pests, notably molasses grass, Melinis minutiflora P. Beauv., and forage legumes in the genus Desmodium, were selected as intercrops (push). Desmodium intercrops suppress Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth. through an allelopathic mechanism. Their root exudates contain novel flavonoid compounds, which stimulate suicidal germination of S. hermonthica seeds and dramatically inhibit its attachment to host roots. The companion crops provide valuable forage for farm animals while the leguminous intercrops also improve soil fertility and moisture retention. The system is appropriate as it is based on locally available plants, not expensive external inputs, and fits well with traditional mixed cropping systems in Africa. To date it has been adopted by more than 30 000 smallholder farmers in East Africa where maize yields have increased from similar to 1 t ha(-1) to 3.5 t ha(-1). Future directions for semiochemical delivery by plants including biotechnological opportunities are discussed.	"[Bruce, Toby J.

Cultivation of traditional hybrid crops in inherently hostile environments forces increased managerial and economic expenditures. Selection of ecologically harmonious crops exploits, rather than opposes natural forces. Based in part on US-AID funded research, we have identified three crops suitable for temperate/tropical cultivation. Amaranthus is recognized in Asia and Central and South America as a food crop that can be grown as a leafy vegetable or as a seed grain in mixed croppings. It does well under a wide variety of conditions using established cultural methods. It is nutritious and highly palatable and, in many areas. is well recognized in the market place. Prosopis species (mesquite) leguminous trees occur worldwide in arid and semi-arid areas. As phreatophytes, they are resistant to drought and high temperature extremes and produce abundant yields of edible beanlike pods. Using the beans from the tree, a variety of attractive, marketable food products have been prepared. We have also identified intermediate wheat-grass, a perennial relative of wheat, as an ecologically and economically attractive alternate crop. It is already a well-established range crop; grown for seed, it becomes a useful grain intercrop. The wholegrain or endosperm mill fractions make excellent tasting, appetizing and attractive baked products. Ongoing agronomic studies indicate it is especially suitable for balancing ecologically unstable areas."

The smallholder farmers are resource constrained and unable to afford expensive chemicals for crop protection. The push-pull technology, a chemical ecology- based cropping system, is developed for integrated pest and weed management in cereal-livestock farming systems. Appropriate plants were selected that naturally emit signaling chemicals (semiochemicals). Plants highly attractive for stemborer egg laying were selected and employed as trap crops (pull), to draw pests away from the main crop. Plants that repelled stemborer females were selected as intercrops (push). The stemborers are attracted to the trap plant, and are repelled from the main cereal crop using a repellent intercrop (push). Root exudates of leguminous repellent intercrops also effectively control the parasitic striga weed through an allelopathic mechanism. Their root exudates contain flavonoid compounds some of which stimulate germination of Striga hermonthica seeds, such as Uncinanone B, and others that dramatically inhibit their attachment to host roots, such as Uncinanone C and a number of di-C-glycosylflavones (di-CGFs), resulting in suicidal germination. The intercrop also improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, natural mulching, improved biomass, and control of erosion. Both companion plants provide high value animal fodder, facilitating milk production and diversifying farmers' income sources. The technology is appropriate to smallholder mixed cropping systems in Africa. Adopted by about 125,000 farmers to date in eastern Africa, it effectively addresses major production constraints, significantly increases maize yields, and is economical as it is based on locally available plants, not expensive external inputs.

They are often over-parameterized, which can give multiple solutions for flow calculations between state variables. This work proposes a modelling method centred on the functioning of living organisms in order to calculate flow parameters using data on N stocks in decomposers, plant organs, symbiotic microorganisms, and the soil compartments. The model was settled via a complex N fixing and intercropping system of durum wheat/faba bean compared to the cropping of pure durum wheat and pure faba bean, all in the context of organic farming invaded by weeds and weeded by hand just before flowering. To avoid perturbation of natural exchanges of C and N, no fertilizer was added from 1997 to 2011. The equation system defined for the association of any number of plants, as well as parameters previously published for C-flow calculations were used, and only a few parameters specific to N flows were added, and are discussed. The results showed the strong link between N and C in the environment. The calculations converge toward an unique set of solutions that is consistent with literature data when available. The labile organic N of microbial origin was modelled as the main potentially available stock. Living microorganisms stored about 1% of total N, which was close to the N stock in faba bean and four times more than stock in durum wheat. Inorganic N was immobilized before flowering in competition with N requirement of durum wheat roots. Net N mineralization, mainly from decomposition of faba bean roots, started too late to improve wheat production. During the cropping period, weeds accounted for losses of 20 kg N ha(-1), while the atmospheric N-2 fixation of 90 kg N ha(-1) was close to the total microbial immobilization. The model associating microbial and plant flows of C and N in complex plant covers, appears as a robust tool to quantify the exchanges of the earth organisms with the soil and atmosphere. It enables to propose essential recommendations to improve as well agro-ecology as predictions of global changes of C and N stocks.

Solute movement through soil is governed by various hydraulic and physical properties that determine water flow. To study such relationships, a pedotransfer function of groundwater pollution was developed in two alluvial irrigated soils under long-term pig slurry applications. Two basins of central Chile, San Pedro (Typic Xerochrepts) and Pichidegua Xerofluvents) were selected, where maize (Zea mays L.) was grown in spring-summer, while during autumn-winter period a ryegrass-barley-oat mixed crop was established in San Pedro and a fallow management applied in Pichidegua. Soils in cultivated and control sites were characterized in physical and hydraulic terms. Nitrogen and water budgets were determined measuring periodically (biweekly) N concentration (N-NO3- and N-NH4+) and monitoring water contents in soil profiles, respectively. Dye tracer tests were performed with brilliant blue (BB) dye and the staining patterns analyzed. To contrast the effect of slurry additions over soil physical properties and over NL, t-Student tests were performed. Some accurate pollution groundwater NL pedotransfer functions were obtained calculated through least square fit models and artificial neural networks. Textural porosity, mean diameter variation, slow drainage porosity, air conductivity at 33 kPa water tension and N-NO3- concentrations were directly related to NL. In terms of preferential flow analysis, stained path width > 200 mm was inversely associated to NL. Finally, dye tracer tests provided a better understanding of the characteristics and pattern of water/solute movement through soil to groundwater.

Our aim was to test this hypothesis for intercropped durum wheat and faba bean along a P-fertilizer gradient. A field experiment was conducted in a long-term P-fertilizer trial with three rates of P-fertilization (No, Low and High P). Microbial biomass was assessed by chloroform fumigation-extraction. Quantitative PCR was applied to evaluate the abundance of relevant microbial groups. Phosphorus availability and microbial biomass systematically increased in the rhizosphere compared to bulk soil. P-fertilization resulted in higher abundance of targeted bacterial phyla, whole bacterial and fungal communities, and depressed mycorrhizal colonization of durum wheat, but not faba bean. Microbial biomass carbon significantly increased in the rhizosphere only in P-fertilized treatments, pointing to P limitation of microbial communities. Intercropping yielded a significant effect on rhizosphere microbial properties only at High P. Microbial biomass P increased in the rhizosphere of intercropped faba bean only at No P level, and was thus the sole finding supporting the stress-gradient hypothesis. P-fertilization was the main driver of microbial communities in this field trial, and P-fertilizer application modulated the species-specific effect in the intercrop. Plant performance did not validate the stress-gradient hypothesis as positive plant-plant interactions occurred regardless of the level of P-fertilization.

Data from a 4-year study were examined to look at the population dynamics of the ricefield rat, Rattus argentiventer (representing 50% of captures), the lesser ricefield rat, Rattus losea (30% of captures), and the black rat, Rattus rattus complex (9% of captures) that inhabit the irrigated mixed-cropping system. We tested the hypothesis that these rodent species were breeding in response to the availability of high-quality food provided by crops rather than in response to rainfall. The abundance of rodents fluctuated annually, with a main peak following the spring rice crop, and a secondary peak following the summer rice crop. There was a strong relationship between the monthly abundance of rats and rainfall, but a weak relationship between monthly rates of increase and rainfall. There were distinct peaks in breeding activity during the reproductive stages of the rice crops suggesting that changes in crop stages were more important than rainfall in this seasonal, but irrigated agroecosystem. The modal litter size for R. argentiventer was 8 (mean of 8.67 +/- 0.20 SE, range 2-16), where the mode for R. losea, was 7 (mean of 7.32 +/- 0.15 SE, range 3-14).

Dual-purpose use of winter wheat in western China: cutting time and nitrogen application effects on phenology, forage production, and grain yield	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE			English	Article						"defoliation; kernels; phenology; nitrogen"	"GROWTH; SYSTEMS; DATE; MANAGEMENT; COMPONENTS; RADIATION; TRITICALE; DYNAMICS; RECOVERY; CEREALS"	Conventional rainfed mixed crop-livestock systems of western China lack high-quality forage and restrict livestock production. This study explored the forage potential from wheat and its effects on subsequent grain yield. Different cutting times were imposed on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) at Qingyang, Gansu Province, in two growing seasons, and the effect of nitrogen (N) topdressing rates (0, 60, and 120 kg N/ha) on grain yield recovery was explored. Results showed the potential to produce 0.8-1.6 t DM/ha of wheat forage with high nutritive value when cut before stem elongation (GS 30). In the wetter year, cutting before stem elongation did not delay crop development significantly (<3 days at anthesis and 5 days at maturity), but grain yields were reduced by 17-28% compared with the uncut crop (5.8 tDM/ha), mainly due to reductions in number of spikes per m(2) and, consequently, number of grains per m2. In both seasons, more forage biomass was available if crops were cut later than GS 32, but this came with large reductions (>62%) in grain yield and delays in crop development (>9 days or 131 degree-days). Crops cut later than GS 30 had greatly reduced harvest index, tillers per m2, and total N uptake but higher grain protein content. There was no significant effect of N topdressing rate on grain yield, although provided the crop was cut before GS 30, higher rates of N increased maturity biomass and crop N uptake by replacing N removed in cut biomass. This study showed that physiological delay of wheat due to cutting was not significant. The forage harvested from winter wheat before stem elongation could be a valuable feed resource to fill the feed gap in western China.	"[Tian, L. H.; Shen, Y.

In field experiments, C. album was planted at two densities in pure and mixed stands with either cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. convar. botrytis var. botrytis) or faba beans (Vicia faba L.), yielding data on plant height, maximum diameter and leaf area. Plant heights of C. album differed significantly between pure stands and mixed plots with an early cauliflower crop. Effects in a summer cauliflower planting were not as marked. Faba beans suppressed C. album, which was unable to overgrow the crop. Assumed to be mainly responsible for plant height modulation due to crowding, the leaf area index around elongating internodes was estimated. In the model, this estimate was related to the stem elongation rate yielding an accurate prediction of potential plant height growth. Because this potential was not realized under low light conditions, a feedback of assimilate shortage on height growth was introduced. Plant diameter was adequately simulated when based on plant density.

J	"Jorgensen, LN; Kudsk, P; Orum, JE"				"Jorgensen, Lise Nistrup; Kudsk, Per; Orum, Jens Erik"			Links between pesticide use pattern and crop production in Denmark with special reference to winter wheat	CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						"Fungicides; Herbicides; Insecticides; Arable crops; Spray intensity"	"MANAGEMENT; INTENSITY; DISEASES"	Pesticides are widely used in European crop production to stabilize yields and mitigate losses from weeds, diseases and insects. Detailed spray records reported per farm and crop have for the first time been collected and analyzed for a whole country, providing good and reliable information on specific spraying patterns in arable crops. Dividing farmers into farm types provided a clear picture on how crops and crop rotations influence pesticide use patterns. On sandy soils, dairy farmers represent the farm type with the least use of pesticides while potato growers had the highest use. On clay soil, mixed crop farms had the lowest and sugar beet growers the highest use of pesticides. Across all farm types, the input of pesticides in winter wheat varies significantly, indicating a differentiated approach to pest control. While all farmers use herbicides and fungicides in winter wheat, the dairy farmers use significantly fewer insecticides and plant growth regulators in winter wheat. Farmers cultivating more than 150 ha had a higher pesticide intensity than farmers with small farms, which was observed for both sandy and clay soil farmers.

Much spatial and temporal variation in the response of different crops to climate change can thus be anticipated. In previous work we showed that a large part of this variation can be explained in terms of temperature and, to a lesser extent, water effects. Here, we summarise simulated yield response in two crops that are widely grown in the region, maize and beans, and investigate how the impacts of climate change might be addressed at two levels: the agricultural system and the household. Regionally, there are substantial between-country and within-system differences in maize and bean production responses projected to 2050. The arid-semiarid mixed crop-livestock systems are projected to see reductions in maize and bean production throughout most of the region to 2050. Yields of these crops in the tropical highland mixed systems are projected to increase, sometimes substantially. The humid-subhumid mixed systems show more varied yield responses through time and across space. Some within-country shifts in cropping away from the arid-semiarid systems to cooler, higher-elevation locations may be possible, but increased regional trade should be able to overcome the country-level production deficits in maize and beans caused by climate change to 2050, all other things being equal. For some places in the tropical highlands, maize and bean yield increases could have beneficial effects on household food security and income levels. In the other mixed systems, moderate yield losses can be expected to be offset by crop breeding and agronomic approaches in the coming decades, while more severe yield losses may necessitate changes in crop types, movement to more livestock-orientated production, or abandonment of cropping altogether. These production responses are indicative only, and their effects will be under-estimated because the methods used here have not accounted for increasing weather variability in the future or changes in the distribution and impacts of biotic and other abiotic stresses. These system-level shifts will take place in a context characterised by high population growth rates; the demand for food is projected to nearly triple by the middle of this century. Systems will have to intensify substantially in response, particularly in the better-endowed mixed systems in the region. For the more marginal areas, the variability in yield response, and the variability in households' ability to adapt, suggest that, even given the limitations of this analysis, adaptation options need to be assessed at the level of the household and the local community, if research for development is to meet its poverty alleviation and food security targets in the face of global change.

Evaluation of lablab and velvet bean fallows in a maize production system for improved livestock feed supply in semiarid tropical Kenya	ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE			English	Article						"cost benefit analysis; legume fallows; maize yield; natural fallow"	"OPPORTUNITY CROPPING SYSTEMS; CENTRAL QUEENSLAND; WEST-AFRICA; LEGUME; NITROGEN; YIELD; CROPS; WHEAT; HIGHLANDS; SAVANNA"	"The mixed crop-livestock farming systems of semiarid tropical Kenya are characterised by low livestock feed supply. The contribution of lablab and velvet bean to fodder production in a maize production system was investigated in the eastern region of Kenya. The experiment was run in three cycles, where each cycle consisted of a short legume fallow phase of similar to 6 months, followed by a maize-cropping phase. At the end of the fallow phase, the legume herbage was incorporated in soil at three levels; 0, 50 and 100% of total DM yield and maize planted. Maize yield from the legume fallow plots was compared with maize grown after natural fallow and maize top-dressed with 40 kg nitrogen/ha and nil nitrogen fertiliser. Overall, herbage DM yield was highest in velvet bean (3.9 t/ha) followed by lablab (3.4 t/ha) and lowest in natural fallow (2.2 t/ha). Mean crude protein from velvet bean was 13.5% of DM, which was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that of lablab (8.4% of DM) and natural weedy fallow (3.5% of DM). Maize grain yield following lablab fallow was 38% (3569 kg/ha) and 27% (1810 kg/ha) in short rains (SR) 2002 and SR 2004, respectively, higher than maize succeeding natural fallow. However, maize planted after velvet bean fallow was 43% (3728 kg/ha) and 29.4% (1828 kg/ha) in SR 2002 and SR 2004, respectively, higher than in maize grown after natural fallow. Generally, the highest maize yield among the fallows was recorded in plots where legumes were incorporated in soil at 50% of total DM implying that the other 50% was available for livestock feed. Maize stovers DM yields were highest at the higher (100%) and middle (50%) level of legume incorporation, and yields were more than those from natural weedy fallow. Maize production under the legume fallow system was more profitable than from natural weedy fallows. It was concluded that if lablab and velvet bean are integrated in cropping systems as fallows, they can provide highly nutritious livestock feeds and improve maize yield and are recommended in the maize production systems within semiarid tropical Kenya."

Carbon dioxide dynamics of combined crops of wheat, cowpea, pinto beans in the Laboratory Biosphere closed ecological system	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH			English	Article						"Closed ecological system; Laboratory Biosphere; Carbon dioxide; Fixation; Fixation rate; Respiration; Evapotranspiration"	"PERFORMANCE; FACILITY"	A mixed crop consisting, of cowpeas, pinto beans and Apogee ultra-dwarf wheat was grown in the Laboratory Biosphere, a 40 m(3) closed life system equipped with 12,000 W of high pressure sodium lamps over planting beds with 5.37 m(2) Of Soil. Similar to earlier reported experiments, the concentration of carbon dioxide initially increased to 7860 ppm at 10 days after planting due to soil respiration Plus CO(2) contributed from researchers breathing while in the chamber for brief periods before plant growth became substantial. Carbon dioxide concentrations then fell rapidly as plant growth increased up to 29 days after planting and subsequently was maintained mostly in the range of about 200-3000 ppm (with a few excursions) by CO(2) injections to feed plant growth. Numerous analyses of rate of change Of CO(2) concentration at many different concentrations and at many different days after planting reveal a strong dependence of fixation rates on CO(2) concentration. In the middle period of growth (days 31-61), fixation rates doubled for CO, at 450 ppm compared to 270 ppm, doubled again at 1000 ppm and increased a further 50% at 2000 ppm. High productivity from these crops and the increase of fixation rates with elevated CO(2) concentration supports the concept that enhanced CO(2) can be a useful strategy for remote life support systems. The data suggests avenues of investigation to understand the response of plant communities to increasing CO(2) concentrations in the Earth's atmosphere. Carbon balance accounting and evapotranspiration rates are included. (C) 2009 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	"[Dempster, William F.; Nelson, M.; Silverstone, S.; Allen, J.

Seasonal time trade-offs and nutrition outcomes for women in agriculture: Evidence from rural India	FOOD POLICY			English	Article						"Time use; Nutrition; Agriculture; Gender; India; Panel data; Opportunity cost"	"FOOD; CONSUMPTION; EMPOWERMENT; ALLOCATION; PATTERNS; DEMAND"	Women in agriculture are involved in agricultural activities and are solely responsible for household-level unpaid work. They face severe time trade-offs between agricultural and household activities across crop seasons. Recent literature suggests that these time trade-offs may negatively impact their nutrition. However, there is no quantitative evidence exploring this relationship within an agricultural context. This paper addresses this research gap by analyzing the relationship between women's time trade-offs and their nutritional outcomes. Using a unique ten-month primary panel data of 960 women from India, our findings show that women are severely time-constrained, as they contribute significantly to agricultural as well as domestic work. Our results show that during peak seasons relative to lean seasons, women's time trade-offs (rising opportunity cost of time) are negatively associated with the intake of calories, proteins, iron,zinc and Vitamin A. We show that this negative relationship is manifested severely among women who are landless and cultivate paddy alone (food crop) or paddy and cotton (mixed crop). This study highlights the gendered role of agricultural activities in rural households and the need to recognize time as a scarce resource when implementing policies and programs involving women in agriculture. We contribute to the literature of agriculture-nutrition linkages by examining the the time use pathway in detail. Besides providing novel metrics, we discuss several policy implications to reduce women's time constraints and enhance their nutrition.

The major cropping systems included potato-groundnut/maize; paddy-potato-maize; paddy-wheat-green manuring; groundnut/maize-potato-maize; maize-mustard-maize and green manuring-early potato-wheat/seed potato. It was observed that summer groundnut was fast replaced by summer maize despite higher water requirement in summer maize (6-7 irrigation) than groundnut (3-4 irrigation) as farmers were getting higher yield (60-70 q/ha) in summer maize than groundnut (Yield: 37-40 q/ha). Summer groundnut was perceived more sustainable than summer maize as the underground water level was fast depleting in these area (declining at the rate of 2 ft. every year). Wheat crop was getting marginalized among small land holders. Major cropping systems followed by such farmers were fallow/dhaincha-potato-maize; maize-potato-maize and maize-early potato-wheat (very less area). Diversification with mixed cropping of minor vegetables likes coriander and kharif onion was also analyzed in these districts. Flower cultivation based crop diversification was documented in this study. It was found that flowers like rose, bela (jasmine) and mehndi (henna) were cultivated by the majority of farmers to address the industrial requirements in the district for making edible products of roses as well as perfumes. Potato+rose was the most frequently utilized cropping pattern as the fertilizer requirements of roses were being met from the residual nutrients of potato. The study recommends that the diversity in cropping systems among the small holders ought to be safeguarded and supported with the appropriate development interventions."	"[Dubey, S. K.; Singh, A.

Budgets of N show that permanent pastures in south-eastern Australia, when growing with no management limitations, can supply more N than is removed in animal products and can eventually lead to excess soil N. For a mixed crop-livestock farm, legume-dominant ley pastures occupying similar to 40% of the land area can maintain a stable N balance. The actual performance of pastures on farms normally falls below the potential. Pastures are being replaced by crops in the wheat-sheep zone and, to a lesser extent, in the high-rainfall zone. Pasture productivity, as indicated by the area topdressed, the mean stocking rate, input of superphosphate and sale of pasture legume seed has decreased in the period 1990-2010. It is therefore likely that N-2 fixation by pastures is falling sharply in the wheat-sheep zone and is static or falling slightly in the high-rainfall zone. Reversing the decrease in N-2 fixation by pastures will become important if the real price of N fertilisers increases, as seems likely because the efficiency of fertiliser synthesis is approaching a maximum and the reserves of natural gas feedstock will eventually be depleted. Increased N-2 fixation by pastures will depend on more profitable grazing industries, improved management methods and genotypes, and re-adoption of ley pastures by farmers. There is evidence that profitability of grazing enterprises is approaching that of crops so investment in pasture science is likely to lead to increased N-2 fixation.	"[Angus, J. F.; Peoples, M.

However, there is circumstantial evidence at best for overyielding as a result of these mechanisms. Overyielding (the outcome) is easily confused with underlying mechanisms because of unclear definitions. We aimed to define a conceptual framework to separate outcome from underlying mechanisms and test it for facilitation and complementarity with respect to P acquisition by three plant species combinations grown on four soils. Our conceptual framework describes both mechanisms of complementarity and facilitation and outcomes (overyielding of mixtures or no overyielding) depending on the competitive ability of the species to uptake the mobilized P. Millet/chickpea mixtures were grown in pots on two calcareous soils mixed with calcium-bound P (CaP) and phytate P (PhyP). Cabbage/faba bean mixtures were grown on both acid and neutral soils mixed with P-coated iron (hydr)oxide (FeP) and PhyP. Wheat/maize mixtures were grown on all four soils. Rhizosphere carboxylate concentration and acid phosphatase activity (mechanisms) as well as plant P uptake and biomass (outcome) were determined for monocultures rhizosphere and species mixtures. Facilitation of P uptake occurred in millet/chickpea mixtures on one calcareous soil. We found no indications for P acquisition from different P sources, neither in millet/chickpea, nor in cabbage/faba bean mixtures. Cabbage and faba bean on the neutral soil differed in rhizosphere acid phosphatase activity and carboxylate concentration, but showed no overyielding. Wheat and maize, with similar root exudates, showed overyielding (the observed P uptake being 22% higher than the expected P uptake) on one calcareous soil. We concluded that although differences in plant physiological traits (root exudates) provide necessary conditions for complementarity and facilitation with respect to P uptake from different P sources, they do not necessarily result in increased P uptake by species mixtures, because of the relative competitive ability of the mixed species.

Intercropping with pulses to concentrate nitrogen and sulphur in wheat	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article							"BARLEY INTERCROPS; WINTER-WHEAT; PEA-BARLEY; QUALITY; SOILS; GRAIN; FERTILIZATION; PROTEINS; DENSITY"	The effects of intercropping wheat with faba bean (Denmark, Germany, Italy and UK) and wheat with pea (France), in additive and replacement designs on grain nitrogen and sulphur concentrations were studied in field experiments in the 2002/03, 2003/04 and 2004/05 growing seasons. Intercropping wheat with grain legumes regularly increased the nitrogen concentration of the cereal grain, irrespective of design or location. Sulphur concentration of the cereal was also increased by intercropping, but less regularly and to a lesser extent compared with effects on nitrogen concentration. Nitrogen concentration (g/kg) in wheat additively intercropped with faba bean was increased by 8% across all sites (weighted for inverse of variance), but sulphur concentration was only increased by 4%, so N:S ratio was also increased by 4%. Intercropping wheat with grain legumes increased sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)-sedimentation volume. The effect of intercropping on wheat nitrogen concentration was greatest when intercropping had the most deleterious effect on wheat yield and the least deleterious effect on pulse yield. Over all sites and seasons, and irrespective of whether the design was additive or replacement, increases in crude protein concentration in the wheat of 10 g/kg by intercropping with faba bean were associated with 25-30% yield reduction of the wheat, compared with sole-cropped wheat. It was concluded that the increase in protein concentration of wheat grain in intercrops could be of economic benefit when selling wheat for breadmaking, but only if the bean crop was also marketed effectively.

A note on the reproductive performance of Damara, Dorper and Merino sheep under optimum management and nutrition for Merino ewes in the eastern wheatbelt of Western Australia	TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION			English	Article						"Damara; Dorper; Merino; Reproduction; Nutrition; Western Australia"		"The reproductive performance of 48 Damara, 42 Dorper and 46 Merino ewes was evaluated under an optimum nutritional regime for Merino ewes that included one annual joining in a mixed (cropping and sheep) farming system in the eastern wheatbelt of Western Australia (W. A.) over a 3-year period. In 2005, when the Damara, Dorper and Merino ewes were aged between 8 and 9 months at joining and weighed 41.2, 42.4 and 33.3 kg with average body condition scores of 2.3, 2.4 and 1.8, respectively, their weaning rates were 71% (Damara), 81% (Dorper) and 13% (Merino). The Merino ewes had significantly lighter body weights and were lower conditioned (p<0.001) resulting in significantly lower weaning rates (p<0.001). In 2006, the Damara, Dorper and Merino ewes weighed 61.9, 69.5 and 61.6 kg at joining, with body condition scores of 2.8, 3.3 and 2.8, respectively, resulting in weaning rates of 52% (Damara), 122% (Dorper) and 117% (Merino). While the Damara and Merino weights and body condition scores were not different (p>0.05), the Damara weaning rates were significantly lower compared with the Dorper and Merino groups (p<0.001). The Dorpers were heavier and greater conditioned (p<0.001); however, the weaning rates between the Dorper and Merino were not different (p>0.05). In 2007, the Damara, Dorper and Merino ewes weighed 71.6, 77.1 and 70.2 kg at joining with body condition scores of 2.8, 2.8 and 2.5, respectively. Again, the Dorper ewes were heavier (p<0.001) than the Damaras and Merinos, which were not different (p>0.05). The Damara and Dorper had the same body condition while the Merino ewes were less and different (p<0.05). However, there were differences in weaning rates between the three breeds (p<0.001), of 64% (Damara), 105% (Dorper) and 134% (Merino). Over the 3-year period, under a nutritional management system optimal for Merino sheep and with one annual joining, with increasing age the Merino ewes weaned more lambs. However, while the Damara and Dorper ewes conceived and weaned relatively high lamb numbers when they were joined as lambs, their reproductive performance decreased over time. This nutritional regime resulted in increased levels of fatness of the Damara and Dorper ewes with no increase in reproduction rates under an annual joining system. A significant factor for the lower conception and weaning rates in the Damara ewes was the enlarged fat tail due to the increased fat levels, which made it difficult for the rams to impregnate the ewes."

J	"Schroder, D; Kopke, U"				"Schroeder, Daniela; Koepke, Ulrich"			Faba bean (Vicia faba L.) intercropped with oil crops - a strategy to enhance rooting density and to optimize nitrogen use and grain production?	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Review						"Root-length density (RLD); Plant-available soil nitrogen; Nitrogen acquisition; Land equivalent ratio; LER-N; Organic farming"	"CARTHAMUS-TINCTORIUS L.; WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; BARLEY INTERCROPS; N-2 FIXATION; FIELD BEANS; PEA-BARLEY; LOW-INPUT; SYSTEMS; YIELD"	Intercropping of faba bean (FB) and oil crops (OC) has two main features: competition in the areal parts and competition as well as facilitation in the underground parts. Root distribution, nitrogen use, and grain yields of faba bean (Vicia faba L) intercropped with safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L) (SAF) or white mustard (Sinapis alba L) (MUS), were investigated in field experiments at two sites in the Rhineland region of Germany. The crop species were grown both as sole crops and as intercrops with reduced sowing densities. In intercropped FB, row spacing was 56 cm with two OC rows in between. This study aimed at optimizing the rooting pattern and therefore enhancing soil space use, nitrogen acquisition, and grain production. Intercropping resulted in a more regular horizontal root distribution compared with sole cropped FB. In comparison to sole cropped FB, intercropping with SAF and MUS enhanced the root-length density in the subsoil, whereas the amount of plant-available soil nitrogen was reduced at all sampling dates. Compared with sole-cropped FB, nitrogen accumulation in FB intercrop shoots was reduced because of reduced sowing density of FB. Total nitrogen accumulation in shoots was ranked as follows: sole-cropped FB > FB intercrops > sole-cropped OC. Regarding the individual FB plant, in intercrops nitrogen acquisition was enhanced at floodplain site 'Wiesengut' where the competiveness of OC was rather low. Compared with sole cropping land equivalent ratios for grain yield dry matter of intercrops were increased at the site 'Klein-Altendorf' but not at 'Wiesengut'. However, land equivalent ratios for total nitrogen accumulation (LER-N) in FB intercropped treatments were generally enhanced by 12% (SAF) to 18% (MUS) when compared with sole cropping. Thus, intercropping greatly influenced yield performance, depending on site specific competition: at the floodplain site 'Wiesengut' OC grain yields were significantly reduced by shoot competition, whereas on the more fertile loessial soil at the site 'Klein-Altendorf' that released higher amounts of soil nitrogen. FB grain yields were significantly reduced by high oil crop competiveness. Consequently, the advantages (reduced plant-available soil nitrogen) and disadvantages (reduced FB grain yield) of growing FB intercropped with OC have to be weighed according to site conditions and the decision regarding which is the most valuable cash crop.

Currently, little is known about the effects of selected cover crops on soil fungal and bacterial communities in no-till systems. In this study, eight cover crops, three mixed crops, and an unmanaged fallow control were evaluated over 2 years for their effects on the soil microbiome. Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was performed to characterize fungal and bacterial communities in the soil during the cover crop growing season, and in the subsequent year. Fungal and bacterial alpha diversity significantly increased over time and were influenced in the subsequent growing season by choice of cover crops. Some fungal and bacterial trophic and functional groups were also affected by crop choice. Fungal pathotroph abundance was positively associated with oilseed radish, alfalfa, and phacelia, but negatively associated with sorghum???sudangrass. Beneficial symbiotrophic fungi and functional nitrification-related bacterial groups were also associated with sorghum???sudangrass and buckwheat. These findings suggest that choice of cover crops influences the soil microbial community composition and may impact plant health in the subsequent crops.

However, its productively in Uttar Pradesh is lower than the average yield of adjoining states. During the course of the present study, a survey of pigeon pea growing agricultural fields was carried out and it was found that 80% of plants were inadequately nodulated. The study was aimed to evaluate the pigeon pea symbiotic compatibility and nodulation efficiency of root nodulating bacteria isolated from various legumes, and to explore the phenetic and genetic diversity of rhizobial population nodulating pigeon pea growing in fields of Uttar Pradesh. Amongst all the 96 isolates, 40 isolates showed nodulation in pigeon pea. These 40 isolates were further characterized by phenotypic, biochemical and physiological tests. Intrinsic antibiotic resistance pattern was taken to generate similarity matrix revealing 10 phenons. The study shows that most of the isolates nodulating pigeon pea in this region were rapid growers. The dendrogram generated using the NTSYSpc software grouped RAPD patterns into 19 clusters. The high degree of phenetic and genetic diversity encountered is probably because of a history of mixed cropping of legumes. The assessment of diversity is a very important tool and can be used to improve the nodulation and quality of pigeon pea crop. It is also concluded that difference between phenetic and RAPD clustering pattern is an indication that rhizobial diversity of pigeon pea is not as yet completely understood and settled.

In this regard 70 livestock farmers were interviewed from different zones of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa including rice-wheat, mixed cropping, low intensity, rainfed and Peri-urban. Results revealed that livestock is the main source of income for 62% of the respondents followed by (21%) crop farming. In the study area, 22% of the famers keep local breed of cattle followed by Sahiwal (18%), Holstein-Friesian (9%). Similarly, in the case of buffalo, Nili Ravi is very common and kept by 38% respondents followed by local breed (22%). In terms of milk production (liters per day) Sahiwal breed of cow is the most productive (9.3 liters per day) followed by Holstein-Friesian (8.7 liters per day), and cross breed (8 liters per day). The area farmers get higher yield of milk from local buffalo (7.9 liters per day) followed by Nili Ravi (7.1 liters per day). Results further revealed that large farmers are more efficient in getting milk. Lack of commercial dairy farms, weak infrastructure, lack of financial facilities etc. is some of the constraints hindering productivity of livestock farmers in the study area.

Field experiments were conducted in 2010 and 2011 to investigate the mechanisms behind overyielding of maize via root length and distribution in intercropping systems and how P application and companion crops may influence the process. The main plots received P applications of 0, 40, and 80 kg ha(-1) and the sub-plots comprised maize (Zea mays L) intercropped with turnip (Brassica campestris L.), faba bean (Vicia faba L), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L), or soybean (Glycine max L), and monocropped maize. At turnip harvest and maize at stem elongation, total root length, growth space and corresponding shoot biomass (on a per plant basis) of maize intercropped with turnip, faba bean and chickpea were suppressed, especially in maize/turnip intercropping. Roots of maize and associated crops can intermingle with each other and the stronger the associated roots, the more depressed will be the corresponding maize root development and shoot biomass. At faba bean and chickpea harvest and maize at tasseling, total root length, growth space and corresponding shoot biomass of intercropped maize recovered to the same values as monocropped maize on a per plant basis. At soybean harvest and maize at grain-filling stage, total root length, growth space and shoot biomass of maize intercropped with turnip, faba bean, chickpea and soybean surpassed those of monocropped maize and showed overyielding and later maturity phenomena until harvest on a per plant basis. Total root length of maize on a per plant basis in the top 100 cm of the soil profile at stem elongation and in the top 30 cm at grain-filling stage and the shoot biomass of maize from stem elongation to grain-filling stage and at harvest were sensitive to P application. There were no interactions between P application rate and cropping system.

Nitrogen fertilizers may influence outbreaks of these wheat diseases where wheat/faba beans are intercropped. To clarify how intercropping and varying nitrogen levels influence wheat powdery mildew and stripe rust and their relationship with crop yield, two consecutive field experiments were conducted from 2015 to 2017. Three cropping regimens (monocropped wheat, monocropped faba beans, and intercropped wheat/faba beans) and four nitrogen levels [N0 (0 kg.ha(-1)), N1 (90 kg.ha(-1)), N2 (180 kg.ha(-1)), and N3 (270 kg.ha(-1))] were evaluated. In two consecutive planting seasons, the incidence and disease index of powdery mildew and stripe rust increased, while the disease index was more affected by nitrogen levels than their incidence. Both diseases were most prevalent at the N3 level. Compared with monocropping, intercropping (N0-N3 levels) reduced the incidence of powdery mildew by 2.8-37.0% and disease index by 15.5-47.4%, increased the relative control effect by 10.7-56.2 and 16.3-47.2%, reduced the incidence of stripe rust by 2.9-42.7% and disease index by 8.3-42.2%, and increased the relative control effect by 5.9-43.7 and 8.8-42.1%. The relative control efficacy of intercropping was most affected by N2 level. Intercropping yield increased with increasing nitrogen by 25.0-46.8%, and overall land equivalent ratio (LER) was 1.30-1.39. The correlation coefficient between disease index and wheat yield for both diseases was -0.7429 to -0.9942, a significant negative correlation, most significant at N1. Nitrogen regulation in intercropped wheat/faba beans can control powdery mildew and stripe rust, and optimize wheat yield. Intercropping at 180 kg ha(-1) N2 resulted in the highest yield.

For the use in the transition period to conservation tillage in organic farming, this study investigated the dry matter production, weed suppression and grain yield of winter and spring faba bean (Vicia faba L.), field pea (Pisum sativum L.) and spring narrow-leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.), monocropped and intercropped with winter wheat (Tritium aestivum L.; winter crops) and oats (Avena sativa L.; spring crops). The different species were grown in no-tillage, reduced tillage and plough tillage systems at three sites in south-eastern Germany. In the no-tillage system the winter field pea grain yields of up to 3.39 Mg ha(-1) were similar to the plough tillage system. For spring faba bean and field pea the yield in the reduced tillage system amounted to 2.92 and 3.29 Mg ha(-1), respectively which was similar to the plough tillage system, but exceeded not 2.15 Mg ha-1 in the no-tillage system. Narrow-leafed lupin displayed consistently yields below 0.65 Mg ha(-1) in the no-tillage system. Normal leafed winter field pea appeared best suited for the transition period to an organic no-tillage system due to the autumn seeding and its high competitive ability Spring faba bean and field pea can be grown successfully in the reduced tillage system. Intercropping can increase the total grain yield and weed competition as long as sufficient soil nitrogen resources are plant available."

Intercropping reduces Mycosphaerella pinodes severity and delays upward progress on the pea plant	CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						"Cultivar mixtures effects; Mycosphaerella blight; lntercropping; Pisum sativum"	"ASCOCHYTA BLIGHT; PISUM-SATIVUM; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; MULTILINE CULTIVARS; SEED INFECTION; DISEASE; DISPERSAL; MIXTURES; BARLEY; YIELD"	Mycosphaerella pinodes is a serious pea disease of worldwide distribution. The increasing interest of sustainable tools for disease control, together with the lack of sufficient levels of genetic resistance has brought our interest in the use of intercropping as a tool for management of this disease. Effect of intercropping on M. pinodes severity was studied in field experiments performed in Spain and Tunisia, in which a susceptible pea cultivar was grown as monocrop and as two species mixed intercrop with either faba bean, barley, oat, triticale or wheat. Disease was significantly reduced in terms of both percent of diseased tissue per plant and vertical progress of lesions when pea was intercropped. Faba bean and triticale intercropped with pea showed the highest suppressive ability with above 60% of disease reduction. Oat, barley and wheat showed low to moderate M. pinodes suppressive effects. Suppressive effects can be ascribed to a combined reduction of host biomass, altered microclimate and physical barrier to spore dispersal. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To clarify the effects of intercropping and the application of nitrogen on the yield of wheat and light within the crop canopy, the relationship between light and yield and their response to nitrogen fertilizer were studied. In a 2-year field experiment, the characteristics of growth, light, biomass, and yield of wheat were measured using three cropping arrangements (monocropped wheat, monocropped faba beans, and intercropped wheat/faba beans) and four levels of applied nitrogen, in groups termed N-0 (0 kg/ha), N-1 (90 kg/ha), N-2 (180 kg/ha), and N-3 (270 kg/ha). The results demonstrated that the application of nitrogen fertilizer increased wheat plant height, spike leaf length and width, and the number of leaves while significantly decreasing wheat canopy light transmittance (LT) and canopy photosynthetic active radiation transmittance (PART), by 7.5-71.1 and 12.7-75.1%, respectively. There was a significantly increased canopy photosynthetic active radiation interception rate (IPAR) of 7.5-97.8% and an increase in biomass of 9.6-38.4%, of which IPAR, biomass, and yield were highest at the N-2 level. Compared with monocropping, intercropping increased parameters of wheat growth to varying degrees. Intercropping decreased LT and PART by 10.8-46.4 and 15.7-58.7%, respectively, but increased IPAR by 0.1-66.0%, wheat biomass and yield by 7.5-17.4 and 27.7-47.2%, respectively. The mean yield of intercropped wheat increased by 35.8% over 2 years, while the mean land equivalent ratio (LER) was 1.36, for which a values greater than 1 indicates that wheat and faba bean intercropping is advantageous. Correlation analysis demonstrated that there was a very significant negative correlation between wheat LT and yield, while simultaneously demonstrating a very significant positive correlation between PART and IPAR with yield, indicating that the efficient interception and utilization of light energy in intercropping was the basis for the higher biomass and yield of wheat. In summary, wheat/faba bean intercropping and the application of nitrogen at 180 kg/ha were effective in increasing wheat yield.

Faba bean-rapeseed silage as substitute for Italian ryegrass silage: effects on performance and milk quality of grazing dairy cows	ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE			English	Article						"dairy fodder; dairy milk production; milk fatty acids; sustainable livestock"	"FATTY-ACID-COMPOSITION; ENTERIC METHANE EMISSIONS; TECHNICAL-NOTE; UREA NITROGEN; CORN-SILAGE; PASTURE; PREDICTION; MANAGEMENT; PROFILE; SYSTEM"	Three trials were conducted to study the effect of including in the ration of dairy cows the intercrop faba bean-rapeseed or Italian ryegrass silages on feed intake, milk quality and enteric methane emissions. Ten lactating Holstein cows, randomly allocated in two groups, were used in each trial in a crossover design. Dry matter intake and milk yield were recorded daily for each data period. Milk was sampled for analyses three times per period. Enteric methane emission was estimated applying a model that includes bodyweight, dry matter intake, nutritional values of feeds and milk composition. Concentrate and grass intake did not differ between treatments, while total mixed ration intake was higher with Italian ryegrass silage. Milk yield and protein concentration also increased with the Italian ryegrass treatment. The milk urea concentration was higher with the faba bean and rapeseed diet. Fatty acid profiles were affected by feeding strategy. Thereby, t11 18:1, c9 18:1 and total unsaturated fatty acid were higher when the intercrop silage was fed. As consequence, atherogenicity index and thrombogenicity index were lower under that treatment. Estimated enteric methane emissions did not differ between treatments. In conclusion, faba bean-rapeseed intercrop can be an alternative to Italian ryegrass to feed dairy cows. The rations formulated with the intercrop silage have potential to improve the milk fatty acid content, and show healthier profiles for consumers. However, it would be useful to study the protein content of these crops to avoid possible excess urea in milk and to maintain sustainable milk yield and milk protein content.	"[Jimenez-Calderon, J.

J	Stika, HP				Stika, Hans-Peter			Early Iron Age and Late Mediaeval malt finds from Germany-attempts at reconstruction of early Celtic brewing and the taste of Celtic beer	ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						"Malted cereals; Experiment; Taste of prehistoric beer; La Tene; Hochdorf; Mediaeval Berlin"		In this paper, we discuss specialised ditch structure from the early Iron Age settlement of Eberdingen-Hochdorf (early La Tene Period, fifth-fourth century BC), that contained large numbers of evenly germinated hulled barley grains. This malt appears to be the result of deliberate germination, given the purity of the finds and the associated unusual archaeological structure, which may have been used for germination and/or as a drying kiln for roasting the malt. The Hochdorf malt most probably was produced for the purpose of beer brewing. To learn more about the morphology of malt and the effects of carbonisation on it, experiments on modern barley grains were undertaken. Their results are compared to the ancient Hochdorf malt. Based on the excavated findings and finds as well as theoretical reflections on the early Iron Age brewing process, attempts at reconstructing the possible taste of early Celtic beer are presented. Additionally, a malt find from late mediaeval Berlin in northeast Germany is presented. A mixture of deliberately sprouted hulled barley as well as rye and oat grains, which were not germinated, was found. The three different cereals could have been used for brewing a typical mediaeval/early modern beer since the use of mixed crops for producing beer has been quite common. Because of a lack of further evidence, it remains unclear whether or not the half-timbered house in the late mediaeval town was a trading place and storehouse for malt or the brewery itself, where the malt was processed to make beer.

Multi-stage sampling technique was used to select 384 respondents for the study. Data were collected using structured questionnaire and interview schedule and analysed using mean, frequency count, percentages and multinomial logit regression analysis. Findings showed that respondents were mainly women (67%), married (92%) and between the ages of 41 and 60 (52%) with a mean household size of six ( 6) persons. Mean number of years spent in school was 10 years. The majority (40%) earned monthly income of. 20,000 and below. The average farming experience was 21 years with mixed cropping (71%) as the major cropping system while combination of livestock and crop production (48%) was the major farming activity done. Farm size was mainly one hectare and below (64%) which was accessed mainly through inheritance (76%) and farm labour sourced through hired labour (50%). Major crops cultivated was cassava followed by maize and yam. Major adaptation strategies used by the cocoyam farmers in the study area included increased use of organic manure (42%), frequent weeding (10%), application of indigenous knowledge (20%), use of information from extension agents (16%), use of fallowing (9%) and application of multiple cropping (3%). Choice of adaptation strategies used by cocoyam farmers was influenced by age, gender, location of farmer, monthly income and labour. Based on the result of the study, it was recommended that sex and location specific adaptation strategies that are within the financial status of the farmers should be emphasized.	"[Ifeanyi-obi, C.

J	"Tesfaye, K; Jaleta, M; Jena, P; Mutenje, M"				"Tesfaye, Kindie; Jaleta, Moti; Jena, Pradyot; Mutenje, Munyaradzi"			Identifying Potential Recommendation Domains for Conservation Agriculture in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Malawi	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						"Conservation agriculture; Targeting; Recommendation domain; Ethiopia; Kenya; Malawi"	"CROP-LIVESTOCK SYSTEMS; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; SOUTHERN AFRICA; SOIL-EROSION; RESOURCE USE; PRODUCTIVITY; ADOPTION; MANAGEMENT; SLOPE; CHALLENGES"	Conservation agriculture (CA) is being promoted as an option for reducing soil degradation, conserving water, enhancing crop productivity, and maintaining yield stability. However, CA is a knowledge- and technology-intensive practice, and may not be feasible or may not perform better than conventional agriculture under all conditions and farming systems. Using high resolution (a parts per thousand 1 km(2)) biophysical and socioeconomic geospatial data, this study identified potential recommendation domains (RDs) for CA in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Malawi. The biophysical variables used were soil texture, surface slope, and rainfall while the socioeconomic variables were market access and human and livestock population densities. Based on feasibility and comparative performance of CA over conventional agriculture, the biophysical and socioeconomic factors were first used to classify cultivated areas into three biophysical and three socioeconomic potential domains, respectively. Combinations of biophysical and socioeconomic domains were then used to develop potential RDs for CA based on adoption potential within the cultivated areas. About 39, 12, and 5 % of the cultivated areas showed high biophysical and socioeconomic potential while 50, 39, and 21 % of the cultivated areas showed high biophysical and medium socioeconomic potential for CA in Malawi, Kenya, and Ethiopia, respectively. The results indicate considerable acreages of land with high CA adoption potential in the mixed crop-livestock systems of the studied countries. However, there are large differences among countries depending on biophysical and socio-economic conditions. The information generated in this study could be used for targeting CA and prioritizing CA-related agricultural research and investment priorities in the three countries.

Effect of sowing date and variety on yield and weed populations in a lentil-barley mixture	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article							"SEEDING RATE; ADAPTATION; GROWTH"	The present study examined variation in sowing date on lentils (Lens culinaris) in a standard lentil-barley (Hordeum vulgare) mixed cropping system in the temperate climate of central Europe to determine the effect on crop yield and weed control. A 2-year (2009/10) field experiment was carried out at the organic research station Kleinhohenheim (KH) and at the conventional research station Oberer Lindenhof (OLI) of the University Hohenheim, southwest Germany. The crop was sown at three dates in the period from March to May. Grain yield was significantly higher at the earliest sowing both for lentils (3.0 t/ha at KH, 2.4 t/ha at OLI) and barley (1.2 t/ha at KH, 2.6 t/ha at OLI). Weed biomass at KH increased significantly with delayed sowing and was independent of lentil genotype, whereas sowing date had no significant effect on overall weed biomass production at OLI. Unlike weed biomass, weed density generally decreased significantly with delayed sowing at OLI. The results indicate that early sowing can increase the yield of lentils, and can be used as an indirect method of weed control in some organic farming systems.

L. meyenii; Phenotypes; Peru; China"	"ANTIOXIDANT; MACAMIDES; PLANT; ROOT"	HPLC glucosinolate (GCSN) profiles and concentration levels were examined in hypocotyls of the four prime Maca phenotypes (Lepidium peruvianum synonym L. meyenii) labelled as Yellow, Black, Red and Purple, grown in Peru (Pe) and/or China (Cn). In Trial I, glucotropaeolin (GLCT) and m-methoxyglucotropaeolin (MGLCT) content, and their ratios, was determined in commercial Maca products of Pe origin and compared with similar products declared as of Cn origin. In Trial II, Maca was propagated and cultivated either in Ancash - Peru, according to a traditional single stage planting system, or in Shangri-La - Cn, applying a two-stage Maca planting procedure adopted by Maca growers in Yunnan. Irrespective of the phenotype, in the Pe cultivation system, cylindrical elongated and pointed Maca hypocotyls (H) were harvested in the mixed crop, while disfigured Maca tubers resembling ginseng-type root (G) were predominant in the crop harvested in Cn. Two peaks of GLCT and MGLCT were detected in all analysed hypocotyls of the four Maca phenotypes grown in Pe, but only one peak (GLCT) was detected in the Maca phenotypes grown in Shangri-La, Cn. Significantly higher GLCT values were detected in all the Maca phenotypes grown in Cn than in Pe (P < 0.05), with the highest content recorded in the Black and Purple H-shaped while MGLCT was the highest in Yellow G-shaped Cn Maca tubers. Cn-made Chinese Maca tablets contained both GLCT and MGLCT. This indicates that Maca imported from Pe could have been used in the formulation - a fact which was subsequently confirmed by the manufacturer.

It remains unclear whether and to what extent the benefits of intercropping on crop yield and land-use efficiency vary between the two regions. This meta-analysis compared the performance of intercropping maize with six annual grain legumes (soybean, common bean, groundnut, cowpea, pea, and faba bean) commonly grown in China and Africa. Data extracted from 73 publications were used to analyze land equivalent ratio (LER), yield gain, nitrogen, and phosphorus fertilizer equivalent ratio. The overall values of LER, nitrogen, and phosphorus fertilizer equivalent ratio were significantly >1 for both China and Africa. The overall yield gain was 1.45 +/- 0.07 t ha(-1), with China having a higher mean (2.3 +/- 0.13 t ha(-1)) than Africa (0.90 +/- 0.07 t ha(-1)). Relay-strip intercropping had the highest LER and yield gain in China, while Africa's yield gain was lower in both strip and alternate row intercropping compared with that of China. Maize/common bean intercrop had the highest yield gain in Africa, while maize/faba bean produced high yield gain in China. The yield gain for maize/peanut and maize/soybean was higher in China than in Africa. Increasing nitrogen and phosphorus rates reduced LER in both regions. Here, we show for the first time that while additional phosphorus increases yield gain for Africa it can reduce absolute yields in China. Therefore, the African farmers are recommended to adopt strip or relay-strip intercropping, common bean insertion into intercropping or moderate phosphorus fertilizer application to substantially improve yield gain and income. For China, minimizing fertilizer use by including intercropping with more legume diversity may contribute to reduced environmental problems while achieving high yield gain.

This study therefore aimed to investigate the profitability of 15 mixed cropping farms with a total of 42 farm plots that were selected from a survey of 100 households (HHs). The sample represented the three dominant farm types: cereal producers (15 plots), vegetable farmers (15 plots) and grape producers (12 plots). A cost-revenue analysis of all inputs and outputs (costs of tillage, seed where applicable, weeding, harvesting, casual labour, machinery use, pruning, pesticides and of revenue from produce sold) over two years showed major differences in net HH income. Differences were largely due to production type and crops grown and reflected differences in market prices for produce. Cereal production yielded a total bi-annual revenue of 9630 US$ ha(-1), and a gross margin and a net profit of 8770 US$ ha(-1). Vegetable farming gave an average bi-annual revenue of 27 900 US$ ha(-1), a gross margin of 26 330 US$ ha(-1) and a net profit of 25 530 US$ ha(-1). Surprisingly, vineyards generated the lowest returns with a revenue of 5400 US$ ha(-1), and a gross margin and a net profit of 4480 US$ ha(-1). The results suggest that among the production systems studied vegetable cultivation was most profitable given its direct linkage to city market demands, rather stable prices and much shorter growing season than for cereals and grapes. In addition, the inflow of wheat and grapes from rural areas into the city negatively affects local producer revenues. If vineyards are to be maintained in the city surroundings, incentives such as subsidized credit may need to be made available to producers.

Hence, two field experiments were carried out with factorial arrangement based on a randomized complete block design with three replications, to evaluate the effects of fertility and cropping systems on quality of safflower in 2015 and 2016. Treatments included nutrient levels (100% chemical fertilizers, 60% and 30% chemical + biological fertilizers and no fertilizer) and safflower and faba bean sole cropping, intercropping systems of them with ratios of 1:1 and 2:1. Results revealed that the integrated use of chemical and biofertilizers in intercropped plants caused to increasing yield components of safflower for both years. The highest unsaturated fatty acids, protein and oil content were achieved in 60% chemical plus biofertilizers. Also, between intercropping systems, ratio of 1:1 and the combinative application of chemical and biofertilizers had the highest land equivalent ratio. Values of actual yield loss showed an advantage of 20 to 98 % from intercropping due to recovery made by intercrops. Therefore, it was concluded that intercropping (safflower / faba bean) with integrated use of the reduced chemical and biological fertilizers, improved growth and quality of safflower.

In a cotton and corn growing region. early and late planted Corn provided Suitable refugia for the third and fourth generations of H armigera, but not for the second generation. In a cotton and soybean/peanut mix system, noncotton crops provided a natural refugia from the second- to fourth-generation H, armigera, but function of the refuge would closely depend on the proportion of Bt cotton. Consequently. it may be necessary to compensate the original mixed cropping patterns in different areas for delaying resistance development of H. armigera to Bt cotton.

However, due to multiple other uses, small landholders in these countries are faced with trade-offs in managing crop residues. This article reviews crop residue management practices, mainly surface retention, incorporation or removal, describing their advantages and limitations in cereal-based agroecosystems in developing countries. The benefits of residue retention are regionally variable and depend on both agroclimatic and socioeconomic factors. Most studies from developing countries in Asia, Latin America, and Africa show positive effects of retaining crop residues on soil quality, soil organic matter and carbon storage, soil moisture retention, enhanced nutrient cycling, and decreased soil loss, among other environmental and soil health benefits. Variation was observed in the effect of surface retention vs. incorporation on various soil properties indicating the importance of taking into account abiotic factors such as climate, soil texture, study duration, sampling methods, and agronomic practices when assessing the impact of these practices. Negative effects of residue retention on crop performance attributed to nitrogen immobilization, waterlogging and decreased soil temperature have also been reported in some environments. Residue trade-offs in mixed crop-livestock systems in developing countries can limit the amount of residue retained. However, interventions such as intensification, partial retention, improved return of nutrients from manures, and the provision of substitutes to the current functions of livestock (e.g. mechanization, insurance) could reduce these residue trade-offs in favour of promoting long-term soil health.

The effect of organic fertilization and liming of soil on yielding of celeriac 'Odrzanski' cv., was analysed. The following types of organic fertilizers were applied: farmyard manure 60 t.ha(-1), rye straw 6 t.ha(-1), and green manures in the form of summer intercrops (phacelia, rye, winter vetch, faba bean). The soil was limed with 2 t.ha(-1) of the common calcium carbonate fertilizer. Celeriac was cultivated just before organic fertilizers were ploughed in. Analysis of the results indicates the dependence of yield on climatic conditions also. The greatest yields of celeriac were obtained after farmyard manure. Faba bean and phacelia were characterized by a very similar yield-forming effect to that of farmyard manure. The highest yields were obtained on limed soil.

The field experiment was conducted in 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 on the paddy fields of the North of Iran (Rasht, Guilan Province) as a factorial analysis in randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. The experimental treatments included bed planting at 2 levels (1. rice bran with bed planting and 2. without bed planting as control) and crop mixing at 6 levels (1. Sole vetch, 2. Sole barley, 3. 20% vetch to 80% of barley, 4. 40% vetch to 60% of barley, 5. 60% vetch to 40 % of barley, 6.25% vetch to75% barley as replacement ratio of crop mixing). The recorded data were the followings: forage yield, crude protein yield and quality traits like crude protein (CP), dry matter digestibility (DMD), and acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF). Mixed cropping indices were calculated by means of land equivalent ratio (LER) and Money advantages index (MAI). Results showed that rice bran with bed planting affects some quantity and quality traits of forage. Among mixing ratios, planting of 40% barley and 60% additive vetch had highest forage yield. Additive mixing ratios had the highest crude protein yield among mixing ratios. According to the results, in the North of Iran the highest LER and forage yield was obtained from rice bran with bed planting and 40% additive of vetch to barley.

Quantifying ecosystem services trade-offs from agricultural practices	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						"Agriculture; Best management practices; Ecosystem services; Trade-offs"	"APSIM-WHEAT MODEL; WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; FARMING SYSTEMS; BENEFITS; YIELD; WATER; CONSERVATION; PERFORMANCE; SIMULATION; INDICATORS"	The concept of ecosystem services (ESS) is widely used to highlight the interdependencies between agricultural and environmental systems. However, few studies have attempted to quantify the potential of agriculture to produce multiple ESS, and to estimate the possibilities for joint production of marketed and non-marketed ESS. A quantification of the trade-offs between non-marketed ESS and production of farm commodities (marketed ESS) may help to better target agricultural policies. We use a well-established biophysical farm-systems model (APSIM) to estimate how alternative farm management practices affect the joint production of ESS on mixed crop-livestock farms in the wheatbelt of Western Australia. Our analysis quantifies the trade-offs between the supply of agricultural commodities (crop yields and livestock weight gain) and non-marketed ESS (groundcover, soil carbon, nitrogen supply, and water regulation). Win-win trade-offs between marketed and non-marketed ESS become apparent when the value of agricultural commodity production is monetised. This study shows that, in our study regions, increasing crop residue retention can jointly increase production value and improve ESS provision of groundcover, soil carbon and nitrogen supply. Conversely, increasing the use of perennial pastures in the farming mix results in negative trade-offs between production values and non-marketed ESS. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ossom, EM				Ossom, Ekpo M.			Influence of groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) population density on weed infestation and yield of sweetpotato [Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.]	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							"CROP YIELD; MAIZE"	"The commonest cropping system used by small-scale farmers in tropical Africa is mixed cropping in which various crops are planted in combinations on the same field, and in the same cropping season. The farmers use a range of populations that could lead to variability in yield; it would be expedient to determine the plant populations of groundmit (Arachis hypogaea L.) that could be planted with sweetpotato [Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.] to achieve effective weed control and yield benefits. A field investigation was conducted in Swaziland in 2006/2007 cropping season, to determine the effects of different populations of groundmit on weed density, weed species distribution and crop yields, under a fixed population of sweetpotato. Five cropping system treatments [(I), pure sweetpotato at 33,333 plants ha(-1); (2), monocropped groundmit at 100,000 plants ha(-1); (3), sweetpotato (33,333 plants ha(-1)) + groundnut at 100,000 plants ha(-1); (4), sweetpotato (33,333 plants ha') + groundmit at 66,667 plants ha(-1); and (5), sweetpotato (33,333 plants ha(-1)) + groundnut at 33,333 plants ha(-1)] were compared in a randomized complete block design, replicated six times. Pure sweetpotato yielded not significantly higher (11.2 t ha(-1)) than under intercropping (mean yield, 6.8 t ha(-1)). A variation of 21.8% in marketable tuber yields (correlation coefficient, r = -0.4267; r(2) = 0.218 1; n = 24) could be associated with weed density at harvest. Intercropped sweetpotato with the lowest groundnut population (33,333 plants ha(-1)) had the lowest number (14) of weed species, whereas the highest number of weed species (17) was observed when the highest groundnut population (100,000 plants ha(-1)) was intercropped with sweetpotato. Interspecies weed competition might have contributed to reduced tuber yields. It is recommended that small-scale farmers plant sweetpotato (33,333 plants ha(-1)) with 66,667 plants ha(-1) of groundnut."

Marginal costs of abating greenhouse gases in the global ruminant livestock sector	MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE			English	Article						"Carbon sequestration; Grazing; Climate change mitigation; Feed additives"	"ENTERIC METHANE EMISSIONS; SOIL ORGANIC-CARBON; UREA-TREATED STRAW; WHEAT-STRAW; RUMEN FERMENTATION; DRY SEASON; RICE STRAW; PASTURE; CATTLE; PERFORMANCE"	Livestock [inclusive of ruminant species, namely cattle (Bos Taurus and Bos indicus), sheep (Ovis aries), goats (Capra hircus), and buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis), and non-ruminant species, namely pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) and chickens (Gallus domesticus)] are both affected by climate change and contribute as much as 14.5 % of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, most of which is from ruminant animals (Gerber et al. 2013). This study aims to estimate the marginal costs of reducing GHG emissions for a selection of practices in the ruminant livestock sector (inclusive of the major ruminant species-cattle, sheep, and goats) globally. It advances on previous assessments by calculating marginal costs rather than commonly reported average costs of abatement and can thus provide insights about abatement responses at different carbon prices. We selected the most promising abatement options based on their effectiveness and feasibility. Improved grazing management and legume sowing are the main practices assessed in grazing systems. The urea (CO(NH2)(2)) treatment of crop straws is the main practice applied in mixed crop-livestock systems, while the feeding of dietary lipids and nitrates are confined to more intensive production systems. These practices were estimated to reduce emissions by up to 379 metric megatons of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent emissions per year (MtCO(2)-eq yr(-1)). Two thirds of this reduction was estimated to be possible at a carbon price of 20 US dollars per metric ton of CO2 equivalent emissions ($20 tCO(2)-eq(-1)). This study also provides strategic guidance as to where abatement efforts could be most cost effectively targeted. For example, improved grazing management was particularly cost effective in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, while legume sowing appeared to work best in Western Europe and Latin America.

J	"Zheng, XH; Han, SH"				"Zheng Xunhua; Han Shenghui"			A generic methodological framework for accurately quantifying greenhouse gas footprints of crop cultivation systems	ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Review						"Climate change impact potential; greenhouse gas footprint; crop cultivation system; life cycle assessment; emission factor; ecosystem carbon stock; soil organic carbon"	"CARBON FOOTPRINT; MAIZE PRODUCTION; NITROGEN-FERTILIZER; N2O EMISSIONS; TRADE-OFFS; CHINA; WHEAT; MANAGEMENT; YIELD; GRAIN"	The greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint of an agricultural system is a measure of the climate change impact potential (CCIP) exerted by the formation of its product(s). Its accurate quantification is essential for determining the green value added tax of agricultural products for food markets, which in turn may drastically change the current patterns of food consumption and production towards a product life cycle oriented economy. This paper reviews the literature regarding GHG footprints of crop cultivation systems. The review concludes that few studies have fully considered the categories/items of net GHG emissions from an investigated crop cultivation system, and thus probably led to biases in footprint estimation. Most studies to date have even neglected changes in the soil organic carbon stocks of ecosystems with annual crops, while process-oriented biogeochemical models so far have seldom been involved in GHG footprint quantification. To help with solving these problems or drawbacks, the authors propose a generic methodological framework for quantifying GHG footprints of crop cultivation systems free from grazing, which takes into account all direct/indirect GHG contributors within a 'cradle-to-gate' life cycle. The authors then provide example values of some GHG emission factors, such as those from machinery operations and other agricultural inputs, extracted from the literature. In addition, direct measurements or model simulations of other major on-farm emission factors are emphasized. The need to further update this methodological framework in future studies, especially by adapting it to mixed crop-livestock production systems, is also indicated.

Pitfall captures of carabids and disappearance rate of experimentally placed fly pupae were similar across the intercrop of peas and barley and monocultures of faba bean and barley, but pupal disappearance was lower in plots of fescue grass than in the crops. In habitat choice experiments, the intercrop attracted significantly more individuals of Pterostichus melanarius Illiger than did the three monocultures. Our results show that carabids can be affected by vegetation structure associated with differences in agronomic practice and that such effects have potential implication for rates of predation in agricultural systems.

For this reason, temporal and spatial determination of LAI are required to improve the understanding of several land surface processes related to vegetation dynamics and crop growth. Despite the large number of retrieved LAI products and the efforts to develop new and updated algorithms for LAI estimation, the available products are not yet capable of capturing site-specific variability, as requested in many agricultural applications. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of non-parametric approaches for multi-temporal LAI retrieval by Sentinel-2 multispectral data, in comparison with a VI-based parametric approach. For this purpose, we built a large database combining a multispectral satellite data set and ground LAI measurements collected over two growing seasons (2018 and 2019), including three crops (i.e., winter wheat, maize, and alfalfa) characterized by different growing cycles and canopy structures, and considering different agronomic conditions (i.e., at three farms in three different sites). The accuracy of parametric and non-parametric methods for LAI estimation was assessed by cross-validation (CV) at both the pixel and field levels over mixed-crop (MC) and crop-specific (CS) data sets. Overall, the non-parametric approach showed a higher accuracy of prediction at pixel level than parametric methods, and it was also observed that Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) did not provide any significant difference (p-value > 0.05) between the predicted values of LAI in the MC and CS data sets, regardless of the crop.

Changes under a range of cropping and grazing farming systems in eastern Australia	GEODERMA			English	Article						"Carbon-accounting; Carbon stocks; Simulation; Stubble incorporation; Stocking rate; Crop pasture rotation"	"LAND-USE CHANGE; CONSERVATION TILLAGE; MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE; WHEAT; NITROGEN; PASTURE; SEQUESTRATION; STUBBLE; MATTER"	The level of soil organic carbon (SOC) that is attained under agriculture largely depends upon rates of carbon input and its decomposition under various agronomic practises such as stubble (crop residue) management and fertiliser application. In this study, we used the APSIM-Wheat and APSIM-Agpasture models to simulate changes in SOC in a range of crop and pasture management systems across nine locations in eastern Australia. We explored the extent to which various crop and pasture management options affect changes in SOC from a sub-tropical to a temperate environment. Specifically, we examined how nitrogen fertilisation, stubble management and stocking rate affect SOC and what strategies might be employed by farmers to increase SOC sequestration across eastern Australia. We modelled a continuous cropping regime, a continuously grazed pasture and a mixed cropping and pasture rotation. Under continuous cropping higher nitrogen application and higher amounts of stubble incorporation increased the SOC levels at all locations. At Roma, the northern-most site, there was little additional gain in SOC from increasing N above 70 kg N ha(-1) whereas most other sites showed benefits above 70 kg N ha(-1). The biggest factor in boosting SOC under cropping was the level of stubble incorporation. At all but one site, continuously grazed pasture generally resulted in SOC increases over the 60 years. However, increasing stocking rate decreased the rates of SOC changes at all sites. Crop-pasture rotations show that the impacts of even 4 years of pasture is likely to be significant in reducing declining SOC at low nitrogen application during cropping phases. N fertilisation and stubble incorporation reduced the impact of stocking rate by reducing the decline in SOC. The difference in SOC changes between nine sites across eastern Australia was largely described by mean temperature and rainfall but high temperature strongly interacted with management practises (stocking rate, N application and residue incorporation) to reduce the sequestration of C despite favourable rainfall. Our results indicate that a mean annual temperature higher than about 20 degrees C can switch a soil from net sink into a net source of atmospheric CO2 if other factors affecting soil carbon changes such as stubble incorporation, stocking rate and site rainfall are constant.

Nutritional potential,in vitroruminal fermentation kinetics and methanogenesis of stover from newer cultivars of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) in buffalo	ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE			English	Article						fermentation pattern	"VITRO GAS-PRODUCTION; NEUTRAL DETERGENT FIBER; IN-VITRO; METHANE PRODUCTION; PEARL-MILLET; FEED; DIGESTIBILITY; YIELD; DEGRADATION; PREDICTION"	Context In developing countries of south Asia and Africa, cereal crop residues provide important fodder resources for ruminants. Genetic improvement through plant breeding for high-quality crop residues as well as for grain yield is gaining in demand among mixed crop-livestock farmers. Aims The present study investigated the potential nutritional quality,in vitroruminal fermentation kinetics, gas production, enzyme activities and methane production of stover of newly developed brown midrib cultivars of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor(L.) Moench) compared with other cultivars in buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). Methods Stover from seven sorghum cultivars - brown midrib sorghum (SPV-2017, SPV-2018), normal grain sorghum (CSV-27), forage sorghum (SSG-59-3, CSV-32F) and sweet sorghum (CSH 22SS, CSV 24SS) - was analysed for chemical composition. Stover samples (200 +/- 5 mg dry matter) from each cultivar were incubated with buffered rumen fluid (30 mL) in 100-mL calibrated glass syringes at 39 degrees C for 72 h following a standardin vitrogas-production protocol for gas production and fermentation kinetics. Key results Stover chemical composition varied significantly (P< 0.05) among cultivars, with highest organic matter in forage sorghum SSG-59-3 and lowest in sweet sorghum CSV-24SS. Acid detergent lignin was lowest in stover of the brown midrib cultivars (1.27% in SPV-2018 and 1.67% in SPV-2017) and highest in forage sorghum SSG-59-3 (9.42%). The brown midrib cultivars showed highest (P< 0.001) total gas production, truly degradable dry matter, organic matter digestibility and metabolisable energy content. The brown midrib cultivars and forage sorghum CSV-32F had highest (P< 0.05) production of volatile fatty acids (acetate, propionate and butyrate) and activity of ruminal enzymes (carboxymethyl cellulase and xylanase) during fermentation. Conclusions This study demonstrates that stover from brown midrib sorghum cultivars (SPV-2017 and SPV-2018) and forage sorghum CSV-32F could be preferred over stover of other cultivars for animal feed owing to their potential for enhanced utilisation. Implications This study provides information on nutritional quality of stover from newly developed sorghum cultivars for large-scale utilisation as animal feed in smallholder production systems of developing countries.

Seeds of Hungarian vetch (cv. 2670), smooth vetch (cv. Maragheh), and local varieties of grass pea and field pea were mixed with barley (cv. Abidar) in a 1: 1 ratio and were tested, along with related monoculture. All legumes in the mixture survived winter while legumes alone, except Hungarian vetch, did not survive in the cold areas. The maximum fresh and dry forage yields (56 and 15 ton ha(-1) respectively) were obtained from a mixture of smooth vetch and barley in provinces with mild winter and more than 400 mm of rainfall. The mixture of barley and smooth vetch resulted in the highest mean crude protein content (17%). Autumn seeding of smooth vetch and barley in a 1: 1 ratio produced more than 2 ton ha(-1) of dry biomass with good quality in all studied areas and thus could serve as an alternative cropping system after wheat/barley in cold and semicold dry land.

Traditional monoculture cereal cropping systems, which rely on frequent summer-fallowing and use of mechanical tillage, are being replaced by extended and diversified crop rotations together with the use of conservation tillage (minimum and zero-tillage) practices. This paper reviews the findings of western Canadian empirical studies that have examined the economic forces behind these land use and soil tillage changes. The evidence suggests that including oilseed and pulse crops in the rotation with cereal grains contributes to higher and more stable net farm income in most soil-climatic regions, despite a requirement for increased expenditures on purchased inputs. In the very dry Brown soil zone and drier regions of the Dark Brown soil zone where the production risk with stubble cropping is high, the elimination of summer fallow from the cropping system may not be economically feasible under present and near-future economic conditions. The use of conservation tillage practices in the management of mixed cropping systems is highly profitable in the more moist Black and Gray soil zones (compared with conventional mechanical tillage methods) because of significant yield advantages and substantial resource savings that can be obtained by substituting herbicides for the large amount of tillage that is normally used. However, in the Brown soil zone and parts of the Dark Brown soil zone, the short-term economic benefits of using conservation tillage practices are more marginal and often less profitable than comparable conventional tillage practices.

Thirty percent of the compound fields contained Striga seeds (on average 0.4 seeds in 100 g dried soil) but emergence of the parasite was rare (0.1-6% of the planting holes). The bush fields were contaminated with 11 Striga seeds/100 g soil on average and Striga plants were observed at 45.5% (10-81%) of the planting holes. Maize in the compound fields is continuously monocropped whereas mixed cropping is common in the bush fields (e.g. maize/sorghum, maize/groundnut). Fallow periods lasted 2 years on average in bush fields and the introduction of fallow was rather exceptional and linked to local practice in compound fields. Two-year fallows were too short to maintain soil productivity in the bush fields. In the compound fields organic manure (e.g. cattle dung, in addition to continuously dispersed human faeces and compound waste) was applied in 8 out of 10 years on average. The bush fields received organic manure or mineral fertilizer in 4 out of 10 years. Due to long-term application of organic manure the contents of phosphorus, nitrogen and organic carbon were significantly higher in compound field soils. The availability of nutrients (NH4, NO3, P-bray 1, K, Ca, Mg), the microbial biomass and the microbial activity benefited significantly from the manure treatment compared to bush fields. The results indicated that the Striga infestation is negatively related to the total nitrogen content and microbial biomass. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to evaluate common vetch varietal differences in stover nutritive value, ruminal fermentation properties, nutrient digestibility, nitrogen retention, and animal performance in fattening lambs consuming a diet comprising 20% common vetch. The results showed that the substitution of alfalfa hay by varieties Lanjian No. 1 and Lanjian No. 2 stovers in ruminant diets could be advantageous in reducing dependence on imported alfalfa hay, thereby enhancing sustainability of small holder farmers on the Tibetan Plateau. Abstract This study evaluated common vetch stover as a feed in mixed rations for growing lambs. Four common vetch varieties were compared with alfalfa (control) for their effects on growth performance, ruminal fermentation, nutrient digestibility, and nitrogen retention. Male Hu lambs (n = 50) aged 3 months, with a mean body weight of 17.5 +/- 0.34 kg were allocated randomly to one of the five dietary treatments, making 10 lambs per treatment. The experiment lasted 67 days with a 10-day adaptation period and a 50-day fattening period, and with the final 7 days used for a nutrient digestibility and nitrogen balance trial. All diets contained 30.0% maize straw and 50.0% concentrate, with different forage sources (on a fed basis): 20.0% alfalfa hay (control), 20.0% local common vetch variety 333A (C333A) stover, or 20.0% stover of one of three improved common vetch varieties: Lanjian No. 1 (CLJ1), Lanjian No. 2 (CLJ2), or Lanjian No. 3 (CLJ3). For stover quality, CLJ1 stover had the greatest crude protein (CP), in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD), and metabolizable energy (ME) content and the least cell wall contents, while C333A stover had the least CP, IVOMD, and ME contents and the greatest cell wall contents. Sheep fed the control diet had a greater average daily gain (ADG), apparent digestibility of organic matter (DOM), neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and nitrogen retention, and greater ruminal total volatile fatty acids concentration than lambs fed the C333A or CLJ3 diet, but similar performance to lambs fed the CLJ1 and CLJ2 diets. The feed conversion ratio and predicted CH4 emission per unit of DOM intake and ADG of the control, CLJ1, and CLJ2 diets was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than for the other diets. Based on these results, stovers of varieties CLJ1 and CLJ2 can be recommended as an alternative to alfalfa hay and for use in a legume crop rotation with cereals on the Tibetan plateau.

Typically sown in late summer and grown throughout winter and spring, it allows for interesting cultural practices, such as frost-sensitive intercropping with companion plants. This practice not only provides nitrogen resources much needed by the crop in the spring, but companion plants can also prevent weed growth in autumn, thereby reducing common herbicide use. Additionally, intercropping has the potential to protect the crop from insect pests. During winter 2019-2020, B. napus was grown alone (i.e., as a control) or intercropped with a mixture of faba bean (Vicia faba) and grass pea (Lathyrus sativus); because of the unusually clement weather conditions, the faba bean did not freeze, which allowed for the evaluation of the impact of these companion plants on the insect pest complex in spring. Insect damage by the beetles Psylliodes chrysocephala, Ceutorhynchus napi, and Brassicogethes aeneus was assessed in both treatments. The larval density of P. chrysocephala was significantly lower in the crop grown with service plants. Egg laying and damage by C. napi were significantly reduced when B. napus was intercropped, and the number of B. aeneus captured was significantly lower in the presence of service plants than in the control. Moreover, the yield from oilseed rape was significantly higher in the part of the field with service plants than in the pure crop control. The underlying mechanisms are only partially understood, but intercropping winter oilseed rape with frost-resistant service plants seems to be an ecologically sound practice with a very high level of potential to reduce insect pest pressure and increase crop yield. This may eventually reduce our reliance on chemical inputs in one of the most treated crops."

Similarly, populations in which genotypes with different pathogen resistance are mixed may have lower pathogen levels and thus higher productivity than genetically uniform populations. We used genetically modified (GM) wheat as a model system to test this prediction, because it allowed us to use genotypes that differed only in the trait pathogen resistance but were otherwise identical. We grew three such genotypes or lines in monocultures or two-line mixtures. Phenotypic measurements were taken at the level of individual plants and of entire plots (population level). We found that resistance to mildew increased with both GM richness (0, 1 or 2 Pm3 transgenes with different resistance specificities per plot) and GM concentration (0%, 50%, or 100% of all plants in a plot with a Pm3 transgene). Plots with two transgenes had 34.6% less mildew infection and as a consequence 7.3% higher seed yield than plots with one transgene. We conclude that combining genetic modification with mixed cropping techniques could be a promising approach to increase sustainability and productivity in agricultural systems, as the fitness cost of stacking transgenes within individuals may thus be avoided.

We hypothesized that insoluble P fractions may be more available to non-legume plants in alkaline soils due to increased dissolution of the dominant calcium(Ca)-P pool into depleted labile P pools, whereas non-legumes may have limited access to insoluble P fractions in iron(Fe)- and aluminium(Al)-P dominated acid soils. Four crop species (faba bean, chickpea, wheat and canola) were grown on two acid and one alkaline soil under glasshouse conditions to examine rhizosphere processes and soil P fractions accessed. While all species generally depleted the H2O-soluble inorganic P (water Pi) pool in all soils, there was no net depletion of the labile NaHCO3-extractable inorganic P fraction (NaHCO3 Pi) by any species in any soil. The NaOH-extractable P fraction (NaOH Pi) in the alkaline soil was the only non-labile Pi fraction depleted by all crops (particularly canola), possibly due to increases in rhizosphere pH. Chickpea mobilized the insoluble HCl Pi and residual P fractions; however, rhizosphere pH and carboxylate exudation could not fully explain all of the observed Pi depletion in each soil. All organic P fractions appeared highly recalcitrant, with the exception of some depletion of the NaHCO3 Po fraction by faba bean in the acid soils. Chickpea and faba bean did not show a higher capacity than wheat or canola to mobilize insoluble P pools across all soil types, and the availability of various P fractions to legume and non-legume crops differed in soils with contrasting P dynamics."

In order to evaluate the effects of chemical fertilizer (CF), bio-fertilizer (BF) and vermicompost (VC) on essential oil content, yield and chemical compositions of Moldavian balm (MB) in sole crop and intercropping with faba bean (FB) a field study was carried out in Iran in two growth seasons. Results indicated that the interaction effect of cropping pattern x fertilizer was significant on dry herbage yield of Moldavian balm (P <= 0.05) and among the intercropping patterns the highest values were obtained in FB:MB 2:2 intercropping. Essential oil content affected by fertilizer treatment and the highest value (0.57%) was observed in CF treatment. The effects of year, cropping pattern and fertilizer were significant (P <= 0.01) on essential oil yield and among the intercropping patterns the F:M 2:2 had the greatest value (19.26 kg ha(-1)). The major chemical components of Moldavian balm essential oil were geraniol, geranyl acetate, geranial and neral. The contents of major components were affected differently by cropping pattern and fertilizer. In intercropping patterns the contents of geraniol increased in BF and VC treatments but the content of geranyl acetate increased in CF treatment compared with sole crop. In both years and all treatments the land equivalent ratios (LER) were greater than one and the greatest LER (1.38) was obtained in FB:MB 2:2 under BF treatment. Generally we can conclude that intercropping and application of bio-fertilizer and vermicompost increased the yield of Moldavian balm and faba bean and also enhanced the contents of major components of essential oil. Therefore these strategies could be considered as alternatives for chemical fertilizer in order to recommend in sustainable production of Moldavian balm. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Advantages of bi-cropping field beans (Vicia faba) and wheat(Triticum aestivum) on cereal forage yield and quality	BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE & HORTICULTURE			English	Article						"Bi-cropping; chlorophyll; crude protein; forage yield; N availability; organic farming"	"WHEAT TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; DRY-MATTER YIELD; NITROGEN-FIXATION; NUTRITIVE-VALUE; COMMON VETCH; GROWTH; BARLEY; PEA; COMPETITION; INTERCROPS"	In organic production systems, penalties in cereal forage yield and low crude protein (CP) concentration are mainly caused by limited soil nitrogen (N) availability, which can be addressed by using cereal/grain legume bi-cropping systems. To confirm this, a bi-cropping experiment with spring wheat cv. Paragon and faba beans cvs. Fuego and Maris Bead were conducted in 2 years, using a randomised complete block design and sowing the crops in a replacement design series. In 2016, the wheat forage yield in sole cropping exceeded that in bi-cropping by 58%. In 2015, the wheat forage harvest index (HI) in bi-cropping was 14% higher than that in sole cropping, but in 2016 it was 7% lower. In both years, bi-cropping increased the CP and the grain N uptake in the wheat compared with that sole cropping, by 25% and 17%, respectively. The chlorophyll concentration index (CCI) in the wheat was 2.2 times higher in bi-cropping than in sole cropping and 34% higher in the alternate rows systems compared with the broadcast system. In 2015, the efficiency of N use (NLER) in bi-cropping was 50.7% higher than that in sole cropping. Alternate row bi-cropping improved NLER over broadcast by 37.9%. Faba bean rust disease was more severe in Fuego than in Maris Bead. In conclusion, bi-cropping in uniform alternate row spacing can improve productivity and nutritional quality of wheat forage, compared with sole cropping. The bi-crop bean cultivars Fuego and Maris Bead can, improve wheat straw CP and reduce rust disease severity, respectively.	"[Kamalongo, Donwell M.

Millsp.] and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. Compared with sole cropping, intercropping of either in alternate (60 cm row spacing) or paired rows (30 cm + 90 cm) with soybean significantly reduced the weed density, dry weight of weeds and N uptake by weeds, and increased the pigeonpea-equivalent yield (2 580 and 2 430 kg/ha respectively) and net return (Rs 8 074 and Rs 7 319 respectively). Manual weeding (20, 30 and 40 days after sowing) proved significantly superior to chemical methods in suppressing weeds by reducing the density, dry weight and N uptake by weeds and resulting in significantly higher pigeonpea-equivalent yield (3 730 kg/ha). However, in terms of net return it was at par with pre-plant incorporation of fluchloralin (1.5 kg ai/ha). Weed infestation decreased both by intercropping (64 - 71%) and weed-control methods (32 - 66%). Paired row of pigeonpea + soybean at 30 cm + 90 cm row spacing caused maximum reduction in weed infestation (71.3%). However, its weed-control efficiency was 13.1% lower than of manual weeding (20, 30 and 40 days after sowing).

Dual-purpose utilization may increase their value in these cropping systems, but no information is available on the suitability of ancient wheat species to this type of utilization. To fill this gap, Khorasan, einkorn, and emmer wheats, clipped at the terminal spikelet stage or left unclipped, were compared in a two-year field trial. The grains were sown in the month of October, in Sardinia (41 degrees N, 80 m asl), Italy, on low-fertility soils and with low-medium fertilization rates. Einkorn cultivars produced the highest biomass yield (2-3 t ha(-1)), reflecting the longer time to the onset of the terminal spikelet stage (119-138 days). After clipping, all species recovered their ability to intercept radiation to the levels of the unclipped crops, but clipping lowered their radiation use-efficiency. Grain yield was not penalized by clipping: the increase in the harvest index compensated for the decrease in biomass. Here we show for the first time that ancient wheat species are suitable for dual-purpose utilization (herbage plus grain in the same season) rendering them valuable for marginal areas; this was because the early sowing adopted for dual-purpose utilization allowed them to take full advantage of their lateness in terms of herbage yield, and to bring flowering forward (i.e. make it earlier) so that a satisfactory grain yield was obtained, even under severe water stress. Dual-purpose utilization of ancient wheats increases the sustainability of mixed cropping systems, by making herbage available to animals in a critical period, without decreasing the grain yield attainable after grazing in the same season."

A recent transition occurred here between mixed crop and livestock farming to a more specialized system, dominated by transgenic soybean combined with glyphosate. According to the ethnographic fieldwork, farmers ranked drought first and flood second as the main adverse climate factors in both districts. Overall, the farmers' representations fit rather well with the observed relationships between interannual variability of yields and rainfall, especially in Junin. The adverse impact of long-lasting dry spells, especially during the first half of the crop cycle, is usually combined with the more linear impact of large rainfall amounts (anomalously positive/negative rainfall amounts associated with anomalously positive/negative yields) during the second half of the crop cycle. This relationship is strong for soybeans, similarly large for maize, far weaker for wheat, and reversed for sunflower, which is the only crop that benefits, on average, from anomalously low rainfall amounts at a specific stage of the crop cycle. The adverse effect of flood on soybeans and maize seems less phase-locked and more diluted across the crop cycle. This paper presents the argument that climate and society have a complex relationship, requiring an integrated analysis of the social context, people's perceptions of climate, and scientific climate knowledge. The concept of climate social significance is proposed in order to highlight the strategies implemented by different socioproductive groups to address adverse climate events.

Nitrate leaching and residual effect in dairy crop rotations with grass-clover leys as influenced by sward age, grazing, cutting and fertilizer regimes	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"Cutting; Grazing; Grass-clover; Crop rotation; Nitrate leaching"	"NITROGEN-FIXATION; NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT; MANURE TYPE; URINE; SOIL; PASTURES; N-2-FIXATION; PERSPECTIVES; STRATEGY; INPUT"	Intensive dairy farming, with grass-arable crop rotations is challenged by low N use efficiency that may have adverse environmental consequences. We investigated nitrate leaching and N fertility effects of grass-clover leys for five years in two organic crop rotations with different grassland proportions (33 and 67%) and five grassland managements in terms of cutting, grazing, fertilization and combinations thereof. In grass-clover, the combination of fertilization and grazing caused excessive leaching (average 60 kg N ha(-1)) but leaving out either fertilization or full-time grazing substantially reduced leaching losses to on average 23 kg N ha(-1). There was no linear relationship between sward age and nitrate leaching. The annual N surplus of the grasslands was only weakly related to nitrate leaching (R-2 = 0.05, P < 0.01). The residual effect of grassland cultivation was highest following grazing and fertilization and lowest without fertilization or cutting-only management and was not influenced by grassland age. The arable part of the mixed crop rotation was nitrate leaky where crop coverage in autumn was insufficient. Nitrate leaching following the crops may roughly be divided into four groups: (1) low leaching (<10 kg N ha(-1)) consisting of the barley wholecrop undersown with Italian ryegrass, (2) medium-low leaching (10-20 kg N ha(-1)) consisting of barley with grass-clover undersown and the 1-yr-old grasslands, (3) medium leaching (25-50 kg N ha(-1)) consisting of barley-pea and 2-4-yr-old grasslands with the 2-yr-old leaching the most (36-46 kg N ha(-1)), and (4) high leaching (>50 kg N ha(-1)) with lupin and maize, where especially maize was consistently high in all five years (average 81 kg N ha(-1)). Great care should be taken during all phases of the dairy crop rotation where grasslands cause considerable build-up of fertility. With due care and the best management practice, nitrate leaching losses may be reduced to low levels. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The remains include stone terraces and conduits in 12 wadis (ephemeral stream channels). Other agriculture-related stone-made infrastructures included a rounded threshing floor and many livestock enclosures. Additionally, many farming-related hand tools and pottery fragments were also found. The pottery and tools were dated to a chronological sequence, ranging between the Late Neolithic (6450-4550 BCE) and recent Bedouin (until the mid-20th century) ages. Some of the archaeological findings suggest that barley and wheat were the dominant crops. This highlights the importance of runoff farming for the subsistence economy of ancient populations, playing a central role in the smallholder, mixed crop-livestock system's adaptation strategy. Agro-hydrological assessment of runoff harvesting potential under the current climatic conditions was conducted for selected six terraced fields. For conducting this, data on precipitation for a 16-year period (1999/00 to 2015/16) was obtained from two meteorological stations. Then, modeling of both alluvial- and fluvial- runoff processes was performed for each of the six terraced fields. Combining the alluvial and fluvial processes revealed that either 6-mm rainstorms, which occur on an average of once every year, or 10 mm rainstorms, which take place on an average of once every 1.8-3.2 years, would allow cereal production in only one of the terraced fields. Rainstorms of 20 mm, which took place only once during the 16-year period, would allow successful cropping in five of the terraced fields. Insights of this study concur with other studies, which revealed the considerably drier regional conditions at present compared to those in ancient times, and even compared to those in the mid-20th century.

The adoption of conservation tillage practices in Oklahoma: Findings from a producer survey	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						"adoption; conventional; conservation; tillage; Tobit"	"LONG-TERM TILLAGE; NO-TILL; ORGANIC-CARBON; WEED-CONTROL; WHEAT PRODUCTION; REDUCED TILLAGE; CROP-ROTATION; SOIL; ECONOMICS; SYSTEMS"	Conservation tillage had initial roots in the Great Plains, but the current adoption of conservation tillage, especially no-till, lags behind in the rest of the United States. This paper documents the results of a recent survey of Oklahoma producers, which was conducted to assess the current status of conservation tillage in the state. Based on responses from 1,703 producers, econometric analysis was conducted to identify factors explaining the observed use of conservation tillage practices in Oklahoma. The survey found that conventional tillage remains the most common tillage practice among Oklahoma producers. According to the survey conventional tillage is used on 43.2% of the state's total acreage, conservation tillage on 26.7% of the total acreage, and reduced tillage on the remaining 30.1% of the crop acreage. A Tobit model was developed to explain patterns of tillage use based on producer characteristics and their perceptions on how conservation tillage performs relative to conventional tillage according to various economic and agronomic factors. The Tobit model identified operator age, farm size, crop rotation, knowledge, and erosion control as highly significant factors explaining the observed use of conservation tillage. The model results also identified potential constraints to conservation tillage adoption and use in the Southern Plains, suggesting that the unique needs of mixed crop-livestock farming systems, and the dominant winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) monoculture, hinder further diffusion of conservation tillage. Future policy should consider addressing the needs of Oklahoma producers, particularly crop producers heavily engaged in livestock activities, as well as finding viable rotation crops to provide alternatives for the winter wheat monoculture.

Low soil fertility, high intra and inter annual rainfall variability together with limited ability to invest in new technologies are among the major constraints to the predominantly smallholder, rainfed crop production in the region's mixed crop-livestock systems. We evaluated the effect of tillage practices (contour and reduced tillage), nitrogen fertilizer rates (no nitrogen -NO, recommended nitrogen -NREC and high nitrogen-N2REC) and residue management (improved and standard) on the yield of maize, cotton and sorghum for two landscape positions (upslope and footslope) for four growing seasons in three locations in the Sudan Savanna region of Burkina-Faso (Dano), Ghana (Vea) and Republic of Benin (Dassari). The studies aimed at assessing the potential of residue retention, tillage practices and nitrogen fertilization to (1) increase average yields and (2) stabilize yields under sub-humid conditions. Over the 4 year study period, across the 3 locations recommended N produced 17% higher crop yields than the NO treatment. It was not worthwhile to double the recommended N as there was no yield benefit of applying more fertilizer. The results revealed no consistent interactions across sites except crop type and nitrogen fertilization. Stability analysis revealed that contour ridging was superior in stabilizing yield. Evaluation of the relative maize yield stability on different levels of nitrogen depicts variation and there is a tendency for an inverse relationship between mean yield of nitrogen levels and its relative yield stability since nitrogen application did not increase yield stability. The outcome of cost benefit analysis revealed that, return per cash invested favored non-degraded sites with cotton production and in years with favorable rainfall conditions. Thus, in the Sudan savanna of West Africa, it is economically risky to invest in mineral N fertilizers when cropping on degraded soils or when rainfall is expected to be erratic.

J	"Descheemaeker, K; Llewellyn, R; Moore, A; Whitbread, A"				"Descheemaeker, Katrien; Llewellyn, Rick; Moore, Andrew; Whitbread, Anthony"			Summer-growing perennial grasses are a potential new feed source in the low rainfall environment of southern Australia	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE			English	Article						"cereal-sheep systems; GRAZPLAN model; on-farm trials; panic grass; Rhodes grass"	"DECISION-SUPPORT TOOL; MIXED-FARMING ZONE; PRODUCTION SYSTEMS; VICTORIAN MALLEE; SHEEP PRODUCTION; FIELD-EVALUATION; PASTURE LEGUMES; UNITED-STATES; CROP; SIMULATION"	In the Mallee region of southern Australia, the dry and variable climate results in frequent summer-autumn feed gaps, restricting the profitability of farms that combine livestock and crop enterprises. To assess the suitability of summer-growing perennial grasses to fill such feed gaps, two replicated field experiments comparing the persistence and productivity of several cultivars were conducted at Hopetoun and Karoonda. The data from these experiments also served to validate a C4 grass model, which was then used in a simulation experiment comparing productivity on two different soil types at three locations. Most grass cultivars established well except on sandy, non-wetting soils. At Hopetoun, four of five cultivars persisted over 6 years, demonstrating the tolerance of the selected cultivars to the typical long, dry summers and cold, wet winters of the region. Biomass production showed little difference between cultivars and a strong response to the amount of summer rainfall, ranging from 1500 to 3000 kg ha(-1) under average seasonal conditions and peaking at 9000 kg ha(-1) in the very wet summer of 2010-2011. Model performance was satisfactory (R-2 0.85-0.93, RMSE 476-1673 kg ha(-1), depending on the cultivar), in terms of predicting both the magnitude and the timing of biomass production. Simulation outputs indicated that biomass production closely followed seasonal trends in temperature and moisture availability. Grazing potential was highest from early summer to autumn, which coincides with the period of feed shortages and highest marginal value of forage. In areas with warm-season (October-April) rainfall averages of 175 and 225 mm, the grazing of C4 grass pastures on marginal soils would be possible in at least 40% of the years for 2 and 3 months, respectively. It was concluded that summer-growing perennials are a promising option to alleviate feed gaps on mixed crop-livestock farms in areas with at least 150mm of rainfall from October to April.

The parasitic habits of these two so-called false root-knot nematode species include similarities to both root lesion and root-knot nematodes. The migratory and vermiform juveniles and immature adults behave like lesion nematodes, causing cavities and lesions inside the root tissues, whereas the mature females are sedentary and obese and induce root galls and specialized feeding sites as do true root-knot nematodes. Limited information is available on the less well-known species X dorsalis, which is present only in California where it has negligible economic importance and parasitizes only a few non-cultivated plants without evidence of attack on agricultural crops. In contrast, many studies have examined the biology, economic impact, and management of the more economically important N. aberrans, which occurs in temperate and subtropical latitudes of North and South America. This false root-knot (or potato rosary) nematode has a wide host range, which includes at least 84 plant species. Many common weeds are good hosts. The results of host and field studies conducted in North and South America indicate that N. aberrans populations can be separated into bean, potato and sugarbeet groups. The populations of each group have distinct host preferences and do not reproduce on graminaceous species or on leguminous species of the genera Medicago and Lupinus. The yield losses reported on staple and industrial crops infected by N. aberrans average 65% for potato in the Andean region of Latin America, 55% and 36% for tomato and bean in Mexico, respectively, and 10-20% for sugarbeet in the United States (Nebraska). Different levels of resistance, varying according to the nematode population, have been found in bean, chilli pepper, potato, and tomato. Most research on crop rotation, mixed cropping, and chemical and non-chemical strategies for management of N. aberrans has been conducted on bean, chilli pepper, and tomato in Mexico, potato in Argentina, Bolivia and Peru, and sugarbeet in the United States.

[de Barros, I., Williams, J.R., Gaiser, T. Modeling soil nutrient limitations to crop production in semiarid NE of Brazil with a modified EPIC version. I - Changes in the source code of the model. Ecol. Modell., submitted for publication] was tested against the results of 3 years, field experiment with nutrient omission using intercropping between maize and cowpea. The plant biomass production, grain yield, N, P, and K uptake by both crops were measured during the period of 1998-2000 and compared with simulated values. Reasonably good agreement and accuracy was obtained between the measured and simulated values for all evaluated parameters. Slight overestimation of grain yield by the simulations was attributed to high rates of floral abortion caused by dry spells during the flowering periods of 1998 and 1999, since this factor is not considered in the model yet. Improvements of the accuracy of the model may also be obtained by more comprehensive understanding of soil resource use by component plants in mixed cropping systems. Therefore, it is necessary to generate more knowledge about the partitioning of the resources by the crops before being incorporated into modeling approaches. The model was sensitive to climate variations and changes in soil chemical properties due to the application of fertilizers and/or lime under the tropical semiarid conditions of the NE of Brazil. Once calibrated and validated for different crops and soil types of this region, the model will be appropriate as tool for regional planning. (C) 2004, Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

G522DR) or tall (cv. 102F) sorghum. SMV-induced seed mottling, averaged over rows outside the inoculated area, was 4.01% in the soybean monoculture, compared with 2.02 and 2.07% in plots with dwarf and tall sorghum, respectively. Seed mottling decreased rapidly with increasing distance from the inoculum source. Gradients were similar in different treatments, but the intercept was highest in the soybean monoculture. Mean soybean yield per plant was most severely reduced in the tall sorghum mixture, presumably due to competition effects. To minimize competition and protect soybean from aphid-borne virus spread, legumes might, in some circumstances, best be intercropped with cereals of similar height.

Gone and forgotten: facilitative effects of intercropping combinations did not carry over to affect barley performance in a follow-up crop rotation	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						"Soil legacies; Plant-soil feedback effects; Arbuscular mycorrhiza colonization; Enzyme activities; Microbial biomass; Belowground interactions"	"SOIL-PHOSPHORUS AVAILABILITY; EXTRACTION METHOD; PLANT DIVERSITY; CHLOROFORM-FUMIGATION; ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; NITROGEN; MAIZE; YIELD; FEEDBACK; WHEAT"	Aim Intercropping often leads to improved productivity of individual species compared to monocultures. We have practically little knowledge of facilitation effects in different intercropping systems and their importance in creating soil legacies that can indirectly affect the succeeding crop in a crop rotation through plant-soil feedback (PSF) effects. Methods To test this, we used a two-phased field experiment where we combined intercropping and crop rotation. During intercropping, we grew maize, faba bean, and lupine in monocultures or two-species crop combinations. The following season, we grew winter barley on the soil previously used for intercropping to test PSF effects under field conditions. Results We found evidence for facilitative effects on aboveground biomass production that were species-specific with faba bean and maize biomass benefitting when intercropped compared to their expected biomasses in monocultures. Lupine, in contrast, performed best in monocultures. After the intercropping phase, total soil mineral nitrogen was higher in legume monocultures creating soil legacies but this did not affect soil microbial parameters and barley biomass production in the follow-up rotation phase. Conclusions We found support for species-specific positive and negative interactions in intercropping. Our results also demonstrated that soil legacies play no significant role under moderately high nutrient environments.

Effect of Strip-Management on the Population of the Aphid, Aphis craccivora Koch and its Associated Predators by Intercropping Faba bean, Vicia faba L. with Coriander, Coriandrum sativum L.	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL			English	Article						"Vicia faba; Coriandrum sativum; Aphis craccivora; intercropping; predators; strip management"	"BENEFICIAL ARTHROPODS; SYRPHIDAE; INSECTS; PLANTS; FIELD"	Experiments were conducted at the experimental farm of the Environmental Studies and Research Institute, Minufiya University, El Sadat Branch, Minufiya Governorate, Egypt to investigate the effect of strip-management and intercropping system with Coriander, Coriandrum sativum on infestation with the cowpea aphid's (Aphis craccivora Koch) and its associated predators, on five faba bean varieties, during the two successive seasons 2007/08 and 2008/09. Susceptibility of the five faba bean varieties to the aphid's infestation was also estimated. Results showed a significant positive effect of C. sativum intercropping with the faba bean varieties, as it caused significant decreases in aphid's population, significant increases in the numbers of associated predators and increases in the seed yields in both seasons. The lowest mean numbers of aphid (263.77 and 254.97 individuals/tiller) were scored in the plot of Giza-843 variety, intercropped and surrounded by the strip management of coriander, while the highest ones (597.37 and 523.57 individuals/tiller) were recorded in the plot of Giza-3 imp. without intercropping in both seasons, respectively. Highest mean number of predators (24.8 and 24.07) were recorded in the plots of Giza-3 imp. intercropped with coriander. However, the lowest means (3.10 and 3.03 individuals) were recorded in the plots of Giza-843 variety alone in the two seasons, respectively. Highest seed yields (1.87 and 1.90 ton/fed.) were recorded in the plots of Nubaria-1 and Giza-843 varieties, intercropped with coriander, while the lowest ones (1.17 and 1.20 0 ton/ fed.) were found in Giza-3 imp. plots alone in both seasons, respectively. Results showed significant positive correlation coefficient between mean number of predators and seed yield/ plant in the two seasons and a significant negative correlation between seed yield/ plant and mean number of aphid /tiller.

Water use efficiency and root distribution	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						"barley; mixed cropping; roots distribution; soil moisture; vetch; water use efficiency"	"FIXED NITROGEN; FIELD; SYSTEMS; SOILS; N-15"	Water consumption and root distribution of vetch (Avena sativa L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) in a monoculture and a mixed culture were studied at Jillin station in South-west Syria in a semi-arid region under rainfed conditions. The experiment was conducted in two consecutive years during the 1991/92 and 1992/93 seasons, using a factorial complete block design. There were altogether four blocks, one of which was harvested at the physiological maturity while the remaining three blocks were subjected to three successive harvests per season. The soil had a silty clay texture with EC(e) ranging from 0.3 to 0.6 dS m(-1). The moisture content at 15 cm intervals was determined using an ''in situ'' calibrated neutron scattering probe. The dry weight of the roots was determined three times at 15 cm depth intervals during each of the successive harvests. The dry weights of the roots were in harmony with the harvested above ground dry matter under the different treatments. The WUE of all treatments in the second season were higher than those of the first. Their values ranged from 1.62 to 2.37 times of the first. This is due to the high water content at the beginning of the second season (47.82 cm in 165 cm soil depth) compared to the first (37.32 cm in 165 cm soil depth). Good rainfall distribution during the second growing season might be another factor.			Arslan, A (corresponding author), ATOM ENERGY COMMISS, DEPT RADIAT AGR, POB 6091, DAMASCUS, SYRIA.

We conducted a field and a rhizobox experiment with the same soil. Maize (Zea mays L.) was grown alone or intercropped with the companions faba bean (Vicia faba L.), soy (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), blue lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.), or white mustard (Sinapis alba L.). We determined the isotopic N signature (delta N-15) of maize as well as soil parameters (pH, phosphatase activity, nitrate) in the field experiment. We analyzed phosphatase activities and rhizosphere pH by soil zymography and pH imaging in the rhizobox experiment. Maize N and P contents were larger in intercropping than monocropping, especially with soy and lupin in the field, indicating intercropping advantages for maize N and P acquisition. Intercropping with legumes decreased maize delta N-15 in the field, suggesting that 11-20% of maize aboveground biomass N was transferred from legumes to maize. Soil zymography revealed high phosphatase activities in the rhizosphere of lupin and faba bean. pH imaging showed a rhizosphere alkalinization by mustard, and a rhizosphere acidification by faba bean. These changes in the companions' rhizosphere likely mobilized P and were also beneficial for maize in intercropping. Taken together, our study provides evidence that the companions' ability to mobilize N and P in the rhizosphere promotes increases in maize nutrient contents and causes maize overyielding in intercropping and thus can contribute to fertilizer savings.

Insects being the largest group of arthropods have a major role in designing various management strategies against different crop pests. Theoretically, these interactions influence the structure and dynamics of an agro-ecosystem and the present project is a good example of this. A mathematical model was proposed and analyzed to study the dynamics, of autonomous predator- prey model with a logistic abundance ratio. The major coleopteran predators; Coccinella septempunctata, Coccinella undecimpunctata, Cheilomenes sexmaculata Hippodamia variegata and Calosoma maderae and important hemipteran prey/pests; Schizaphis graminum, Aphis maidis, Macrosiphum miscanthi, Aphis gossypii and Diuraphis noxia were sampled from mixed crop agro-ecosystems of Central Punjab. The study was conducted to find the monthly abundance ratios of each predator species with all of the prey species in wheat, fodder and brassica crops. A graphed horizontal straight line was taken as constant predator-prey relationship. Chi-square test was applied on the relative abundance of a predator with selected prey species. Accordingly, most of the predators in different crops (wheat fodder and brassica) depicted a straight line showing least changes in nearly all monthly samples with S. graminum.

The current AES regime allows for both holistic measures, such as organic farming, that broadly target the agricultural environment and biodiversity-specific measures, such as flowering fields, but little is known of their relative efficacies. To address this gap, we studied carabids in 48 arable fields that presented four crop types under different management practices along a gradient of landscape complexity: (a) conventionally managed crop (winter wheat), (b) biodiversity-specific AES under conventional management (sown flowering field), (c) organically managed mono-crop (winter spelt) and (d) organically managed lentil-mixedcrop (lentil intercropped with cereal or camelina). For these crop-use types, we compared functional diversity of carabid assemblages at the edge and center of the fields. Using pitfall traps, we collected more than 55,000 carabids of 95 species over two years. We characterized diversity using community weighted means and functional divergence of three ecological traits - body size, feeding type, and flight ability. Conventional flowering fields and organic winter spelt, but not organic spring sown lentil-mixed-crop, increased the proportion of plant-feeding carabids; moreover, trait characteristics and their divergences were most affected by field edges, with smaller, less carnivorous and more flight-enabled carabid assemblages found there than in the center. Divergence of body size and feeding type but not of flight ability was larger at the field edges than centres. Surrounding landscape complexity did not affect carabid traits. We conclude that future AES policy should avoid strict decisions between biodiversity specific- and holistic measures. Instead, priority should be given to a diversity of different measures, targeting the enhancement of edge habitats as well as productive and non-productive measures."

Whitefly populations on tomato, eggplant, zucchini, cucumber; and pepper were monitored weekly by beat-pan sampling and biweekly by visual counts, and parasitism was determined by rearing parasitoids from whitefly infested tomato and eggplant foliage, Analysis of the sampling data identified tomato and eggplant as the most attractive whitely host plants followed by cucumber, zucchini, and pepper. Parasitism of whiteflies on tomato and eggplant reached 80% during the study. Two peaks in population numbers were observed on tomato and eggplant planted by late September, whereas only 1 peak occurred when the same crops were planted later. The suitability of a spatially explicit population model as a tool for investigating insect dynamics was demonstrated on whiteflies at the farm. Simulation experiments conducted to explain the trends in whitefly population numbers observed on early and late tomato indicated that these population peaks likely resulted from the interaction of planting date and temperature and not from the spatial heterogeneity of the crop system at the farm. Other simulation experiments showed that whitely population levels could be lowered by grouping similar crops and maintaining barriers to whitefly movement between crops.

Changes in a range of soil physical and chemical properties, earthworm populations and crop yields were compared under conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT). Trials were conducted for 9 consecutive years at two sites. The Lismore site had been under long-term pasture prior to initiation of the experiment, whilst the Wakanui site had been under long-term arable cropping. At the Lismore site, organic C and total N contents in the top 150 mm of soil declined under both treatments during the trial, although the decrease was relatively greater under CT. Tillage treatment had little effect on soil organic matter content at the Wakanui site. At both sites, organic matter was more evenly distributed in the top 150 mm of soil under CT than NT. Bulk density was largely unaffected by tillage treatment on the Lismore soil, but on the Wakanui soil it was greater under NT at 0-150 mm depth throughout most of the trial. For both the Lismore and Wakanui soils, macroporosity was generally less in the surface (0-75 mm) layers of uncultivated soil. At both sites, earthworm populations were greater under NT than CT. Yields of wheat tended to be greater under NT at both sites, with crops grown under CT requiring an additional 15-45 kg N ha-1 to obtain yields similar to those under NT. At the Wakanui site, by contrast, spring barley yields were greater under CT with an additional 10-20 kg N ha-1 required under NT to provide yields similar to those under CT. Under CT there is a flush of mineralization following cultivation, whilst under NT mineralization is more evenly distributed over the growing season. Crops grown following cultivation in autumn/winter have a more adequate N supply during the growing season under NT than CT, as much of the N which is mineralized after cultivation of CT soil is susceptible to leaching before the spring. Crops grown following cultivation in the spring have a more adequate N-supply than those under NT, as the flush of N mineralization under CT occurs immediately prior to the onset of rapid crop growth.

We also assessed the consequences of the cropping system for maize yield. The main insect pests recorded were Diabrotica spp. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), Carpophilus sp. (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) and Pagiocerus frontalis (Coleoptera: Scolytidae), and their overall abundance did not differ among crop diversity treatments. However, there was a significant adverse effect of crop diversity on the maximum abundance of both Carpophilus and Pagiocerus. The main beneficial arthropods were Paraniphleps sp. (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), ladybirds and spiders, and their density did not differ among treatments. Maize yield did not decrease with increasing plant diversity. The reported benefits of intercropping, together with the associated efficiency in land use, make this traditional agricultural practice a valuable alternative to the use of pesticides, particularly for resource-poor Andean farmers.

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of intercropping on the concentrations of micronutrients in maize grain and their acquisition via the shoot. We conducted field experiments to investigate the effects of intercropping with turnip (Brassica campestris L.), faba bean (Vicia faba L.), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), and soybean (Glycine max L.) on the iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) concentrations in the grain and their acquisition via the above-ground shoots of maize (Zea mays L.). Compared with monocropped maize grain, the grain of maize intercropped with legumes showed lower concentrations of Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn and lower values of their corresponding harvest indexes. The micronutrient concentrations and harvest indexes in grain of maize intercropped with turnip were the same as those in monocropped maize grain. Intercropping stimulated the above-ground maize shoot acquisition of Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn, when averaged over different phosphorus (P) application rates. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the effects of intercropping on micronutrient concentrations in maize grain and on micronutrients acquisition via maize shoots (straw+grain). The maize grain Fe and Cu concentrations, but not Mn and Zn concentrations, were negatively correlated with maize grain yields. The concentrations of Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn in maize grain were positively correlated with their corresponding harvest indexes. The decreased Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn concentrations in grain of maize intercropped with legumes were attributed to reduced translocation of Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn from vegetative tissues to grains. This may also be related to the delayed senescence of maize plants intercropped with legumes. We conclude that turnip/maize intercropping is beneficial to obtain high maize grain yield without decreased concentrations of Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn in the grain. Further research is required to clarify the mechanisms underlying the changes in micronutrient concentrations in grain of intercropped maize.

Three years of field experiments with different rates of P fertilizer (0, 40 and 80 kg ha(-1)) as main effects and maize (Zea mays L) intercropping with oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), turnip (Brassica campestris L), faba bean (Vicia faba L.), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L) and soybean (Glycine max L.) with the respective monocultures as subplot effects were carried out to study the influence of fertilizer P application on productivity, shoot P content, apparent recovery of fertilizer P and soil Olsen-P in intercrops and monocultures. Average total grain yields and shoot P contents of maize/turnip, maize/faba bean, maize/chickpea and maize/soybean intercropping increased by 30.7%, 24.8%, 24.4%, and 25.3% and by 44.6%, 30.7%, 39.1%, and 28.6%, respectively, compared with the weighted means of the corresponding monocultures, and were highest at 40 kg Pha(-1). Moreover, the average apparent recovery of fertilizer P of the intercropping systems increased from 6.1% to 30.6% at 40 kg Pha(-1) and from 4.8% to 14.5% at 80 kg Pha(-1) compared with overall monoculture systems on average over three years. The results indicate that intercropping and a rational P application rate (e.g. 40 kg Pha(-1)) maintained maximum total grain production and shoot P content, P balance of inputs/outputs and soil Olsen-P at an appropriate level (21.3 mg kg(-1)), and maximum apparent recovery of fertilizer P (30.6%) through exploitation of the biological potential for efficient acquisition of P and other resources by interspecific interactions toward a sustainable and productive agricultural system.

It hit the Vendee and Charente-Maritime departments hardest, as storm surge flooded up to 23,000ha of coastal agricultural areas (i.e. polders), causing severe damage to farming operations. However, farm-level damage in the aftermath of seawater flooding is an issue that has rarely been explored in the literature. Here we investigated the effects of storm Xynthia on agriculture at the farm scale. We focused on the case study of Saint Laurent de la Pree research farm, a mixed crop-livestock system that was severely hit. All damages were described and economic losses were quantified for the years 2010 and 2011. The results show numerous consequences of the storm in terms of crop and fodder production losses, but also farm infrastructure repairs, crop restoration and animal health problems. Economic damage costs were high, reaching Euro71,720 in 2010 (Euro500/ha flooded) and Euro56,195 (Euro390/ha) in 2011 for the case study farm. The discussion highlights the farm-level impacts of seawater flooding and the crucial factors that can explain the damage caused to agriculture by storm events in coastal areas. The results are also discussed in the wider context of global warming which is expected to cause sea level rise and more frequent storm events in the future. The vulnerability of coastal agricultural areas to storms thus exposes broader issues of coastal flooding risk management and specifically the allied protection-remediation-adaptation measures. The conclusions underline the need for future research to address prospective scenarios and subsequent adaptive strategies.

Optimum time of harvest and planting date relative to the maize crop were determined. In addition to growing the legumes as sole crops, their performance as in-row intercrops with a long-season maize cultivar was investigated, to determine whether the nutritive value of the maize biomass could be increased with little compromising of yield, and with a view to decreasing harvesting and mixing procedures and machinery requirements. High yields of biomass of high digestibility and crude protein content were produced by sole crops of soyabean, forage soya and lablab. Maximum digestible dry matter (DDM) yields of grain and forage soyabean were 4840 and 6140 kg/ha (at mid and late green pod), respectively, whilst the highest DDM yield measured for lablab of 5243 kg/ha at early green pod indicated that this legume had not reached its peak. Though sunnhemp was very productive as a sole crop, its stemminess and poor quality restricted its use to being harvested at very early flowering. To ensure synchronization of harvesting between these legumes and maize cut for silage at 16-17 weeks after planting, based on quality and yield of biomass, grain soya should be planted 1-2 weeks later than, and forage soya and lablab at approximately the same time as, the maize. The legumes showing potential for intercropping with maize were the soyabeans, lablab and velvet bean and possibly sunnhemp and cowpea. In-row intercropping with long-season maize did not prove to be a viable system: the proportion of legume in the biomass was only 15% or less, except with velvet bean which comprised nearly 30% of the biomass but depressed maize yield unacceptably.

We therefore investigated the factors that may possibly control the release of N compounds from the roots of soybean (Glycine max L, Merr, cv, Bragg). Treatment consisted of shoot detachment at the vegetative growth stage. In addition we compared the release of N compounds from roots of plants with detached shoots and intact plants. Shoot detachment resulted in the increase of the release of N compounds, but decrease in nitrogen fixation, root respiration, sugar and ATP concentrations, The rates of decrease in nitrogen fixation, root respiration, and ATP concentration mere rapid within 2 h after treatment, while the rate of decrease in the sugar concentration was slower. Both root ATP concentration and the release of N compounds from plants with detached shoots were the largest around 8 and 24 h after treatment, Shoot detachment resulted in the increase in the amounts of ureides and amino acids in nodules, The release of N compounds was more closely related to the root ATP concentration than to the sugar concentration, It is suggested that the decrease in root ATP concentration may be involved in the release of N compounds from roots of legumes.

The main objective of the present work was to test this hypothesis. First a method has been developed which allows the quantification of organic anion exudation from individual cluster roots formed by P-deficient white lupin (Lupinus albus L.). Lupin plants were grown in nutrient solution at 1 mu M P and in a low P loess in small rhizotrons. Organic anions exuded from intact plants grown in nutrient solution were collected from individual cluster roots and root tips sealed in small compartments by an anion-exchange resin placed in nylon bags (resin-bags). Succinate was the dominant organic anion exuded followed by citrate and malate. The mean of citrate exudation-rate was 0.06 pmol mm(-1) s(-1) with exudation highly dependent on the citrate concentration and on the age of the cluster roots. Exudates from cluster roots and root tips grown at the soil surface (rhizotron-grown plants) were collected using overlayered resin-agar (resin mixed with agar). Citrate exudation from cluster roots was 10 times higher than that from root tips. Fractionation of P in the cluster root rhizosphere-soil indicates that white lupin can mobilize P not only from the available and acid-soluble P, but also from the stable residual soil P fractions. In pot experiments with an acid luvisol derived from loess low in available P, growth of wheat was significantly improved when mixed-cropped with white lupin due to improved P uptake. Both in mixed culture and in rotation wheat could benefit from the P mobilization capacity of white lupin, supporting the hypothesis above. Nine tropical leguminous cover crops and maize were grown in a pot experiment using a luvisol from Northern Nigeria low in available P. All plant species derived most of their P from the resin and bicarbonate-extractable inorganic P. Organic P (P-o) accumulated particularly in the rhizosphere of all plant species. There was a significant negative correlation between the species-specific rhizosphere acid phosphatase activity and P-o accumulation. Growth and P uptake of maize grown in rotation after legumes were enhanced indicating that improved P nutrition was a contributing factor.

J	"Zhang, FS; Li, L"				"Zhang, FS; Li, L"			Using competitive and facilitative interactions in intercropping systems enhances crop productivity and nutrient-use efficiency	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						"intercropping; interspecific competition; interspecific facilitation; recovery; yield advantage"	"GRAIN-YIELD; MAIZE; CORN; WHEAT/MAIZE; RECOVERY"	This paper reviews recent research on the processes involved in the yield advantage in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/maize (Zea mays L.), wheat/soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], faba bean (Vicia faba L.)/maize, peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.)/maize and water convolvulus (Ipomoea aquatica Forsk.)/maize intercropping. In wheat/maize and wheat/soybean intercropping systems, a significant yield increase of intercropped wheat over sole wheat was observed, which resulted from positive effects of the border row and inner rows of intercropped wheat. The border row effect was due to interspecific competition for nutrients as wheat had a higher competitive ability than either maize or soybean had. There was also compensatory growth, or a recovery process, of subordinate species such as maize and soybean, offsetting the impairment of early growth of the subordinate species. Finally, both dominant and subordinate species in intercropping obtain higher yields than that in corresponding sole wheat, maize or soybean. We summarized these processes as the 'competition-recovery production principle'. We observed interspecific facilitation, where maize improves iron nutrition in intercropped peanut, faba bean enhances nitrogen and phosphorus uptake by intercropped maize, and chickpea facilitates P uptake by associated wheat from phytate-P. Furthermore, intercropping reduced the nitrate content in the soil profile as intercropping uses soil nutrients more efficiently than sole cropping.

Barley, fescue, faba (field) bean and a barley/field pea intercrop were grown continuously on different soils at Ellerslie and Breton using two distinct tillage methods. The agronomic performance, weed-crop interactions and below-ground productivity of these cropping systems were examined. The main findings were as follows: different soil properties did not affect yields of barley, barley/field pea and fescue fertilized with N and P; silage yield of faba bean at Breton was greater than at Ellerslie; barley/field pea and faba bean could be grown without tillage at Ellerslie; barley/field pea plots had the lowest weed counts; fescue root biomass was greatest at all depths followed by faba bean and barley, and soil properties appeared not to induce differences in root production of a cereal, an annual forage legume and a perennial grass. Increasing the use of annual legumes into rotations, either as sole crops or as intercrops with cereals, may be a viable alternative to continuous cereal cropping because annual legumes contribute N through biological N fixation, reduce weed competition and increase the input of root mass in soil."

Assessing the potential of dual-purpose maize in southern Africa: A multi-level approach	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Feed resources; Maize cultivars; Crop-livestock systems; GIS; Southern Africa"	"CROP-LIVESTOCK SYSTEMS; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; WATER PRODUCTIVITY; AGRICULTURE; BENEFITS; MARKET"	"This paper explores the potential and challenges of increasing production of food and feed on existing maize fields in mixed crop-livestock systems in the semi-arid areas of southern Africa. It integrates results from different sources of data and analysis: 1. Spatial stratification using secondary data for GIS layers: Maize mega-environments combined with recommendation domains for dual-purpose maize were constructed for Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, stratifying the countries by demand factors (livestock densities and human population densities) and feed availability. Relative biomass contributions to feed resources from rangelands were compared to those from croplands to explore the usefulness of global datasets for feed supply estimations. 2. Verification through farming systems analysis: the potential demand for maize residues as feed (maize cropping patterns, maize yields and uses, feed deficits) was compared at contrasting sites, based on household survey data collected on 480 households in 2010. 3. Maize cultivar analysis: Genotypic variability of maize cultivars was compared to evaluate the potential contribution (stover quantity and quality) of dual-purpose maize to reduce feed deficits. The study results illustrate high spatial variability in the demand for and supply of maize residues. Northern Malawi is characterized by high livestock density, high human population density and high feed availability. Farmers achieve maize yields of more than 2 t/ha resulting in surplus of residues. Although livestock is important, southwest Zimbabwe has low livestock densities, low human populations and low feed availability; farming systems are more integrated and farmers make greater use of maize residues to address feed shortages. Central Mozambique also has low cattle densities, low human populations and low feed availability. More rangelands are available but maize yields are very low and livestock face severe feed shortages. The investigation of 14 advanced CIMMYT maize landraces cultivars and 15 advanced hybrids revealed significant variations in grain and stover yield and fodder quality traits. Where livestock densities are high and alternative feed resources are insufficient, maize cultivars with superior residue yield and fodder quality can have substantial impact on livestock productivity. Cultivars at the higher end of the quality range can provide sufficient energy for providing livestock maintenance requirements and support about 200g of live weight gain daily. Maize cultivars can be targeted according to primary constraints of demand domains for either stover quantity or stover fodder quality and the paper proposes an approach for this based on voluntary feed intake estimates for maize stover.

Cattle were fed a range of diets to investigate the effects on partitioning of nitrogen between urine and faeces and on the chemical composition of the manures produced. The trade-offs in efficiency between using the feed resources as a direct soil amendment for crop production compared with feeding to livestock and use of the manure as a fertiliser are discussed. Increased dry matter (DM) and nitrogen intake of a poor quality basal diet (barley straw) was achieved by supplementation with 15 and 30% of DM offered as Calliandra calothyrsus, Macrotyloma axillare or poultry manure. Urinary-N excretion for the basal diet (0.5 mg kg(-1) liveweight (W) per day) was similar to C, calothyusus at 15 and 30% supplementation (1.3 and 0.8 mg kg(-1) W per day, respectively) and M, axillare at 15 and 30% supplementation (0.4 and 0.6 mg kg(-1) W per day, respectively). In contrast, feeding poultry manure, a supplement containing highly degradable N, resulted in larger excretions of excess rumen ammonia as N in the urine, 17.5 and 23.2 mg kg(-1) W per day for 15 and 30% supplementation, respectively. Diets containing the largest rate of C, calothyrsus supplementation had the lowest digestibility of N in the acid detergent fibre (ADF) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) fractions. This was reflected in faeces from cattle fed diets supplemented with C. calothyrsus, which had substantially greater amounts of N bound to fibre (ADF and NDF) fractions than faeces from the other diets. When incubated in leaching tubes prunings of C, calothyusus showed net N mineralisation from week 2, whereas barley straw, M, axillare and poultry manure immobilised N for > 28, 24 and > 28 weeks, respectively. Faeces derived from supplementation with C. calothyrsus and M, axillare resulted in shorter nitrogen immobilisation in leaching tubes (16 weeks) than supplementation with poultry manure (24 weeks) when compared with faeces derived from animals fed straw only (28 weeks). Similarly, reduced N uptake from 10-week-old maize plants was observed in pots to which faeces had been added compared with the control treatment. A second crop of maize had increased N uptake. Feeding poor quality crop residues like barley straw to animals produces manures with a decreased capacity to immobilise mineral N in the soil. This was shown with faeces derived from feeding ruminants a diet of only barley straw which had a faster N mineralisation rate than fresh barley straw, a shorter and smaller N immobilisation stage in leaching tubes and gave greater N uptake in maize grown in pots. These results indicate that N losses in urine from livestock may be less important than previously thought. Most of the N is excreted in the faeces, which must be conserved and managed to maximise nutrient cycling. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Inter- and intraspecific diversity were evaluated in combination using 15 wheat (Triticum aestivum) entries, including line cultivars and heterogeneous populations (HPs), from central Europe and Hungary and one winter pea cultivar under organic conditions. Monocultures and wheat mixtures were evaluated multi-functionally for yield, quality, land use efficiency, crop protection, and wheat entry traits. Mixtures increased cereal grain quality, weed suppression, resource use efficiency, yield gain, and reduced lodging. Effects were stronger in 2018/19, which were characterized by dry and nutrient-poor conditions than in 2019/20 when nutrient levels were higher. Wheat entries varied considerably in protein content and yield in both mixtures and monocultures. Under higher nutrient availability, entry-based variation was reduced in both systems, and peas were suppressed. Because of low disease pressure, the wheat entries varied little in terms of disease protection services, and mixture effects on the disease were low. The multi-criteria framework identified stability of yield, yield gains, and quality under high environmental variability of mixtures as clear agronomic advantages with HPs being considerably more stable than line cultivars. Some line cultivars outperformed the HPs in either protein content or yield across environments but not both simultaneously. Trait analysis revealed a possible link between harvest index and reduced competition in mixtures, which can increase yield performance in specific line cultivars. System cultivar interactions were generally very low and highly dependent on environmental conditions. We conclude that while cultivar breeding for mixtures can be successful in monocultures, high environmental variation highlights the necessity of evaluating cultivars in mixtures. In addition, use of intraspecific diversity within interspecific mixed cropping systems can be a valuable addition to further improve mixture performance and its stability under increasing environmental stresses due to climate change.

Water requirements for livestock production: a global perspective	REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES			English	Article						"Livestock production; Protein, biological value; Virtual water; Water; Water efficiency; Water pricing; Water quality; Water usage"	"LACTATING DAIRY-COWS; HOLSTEIN COWS; GROWING-PIGS; CATTLE; CONSUMPTION; SHEEP; METABOLISM; FOOD; NUTRITION; EXCRETION"	Water is a vital but poorly studied component of livestock production. It is estimated that livestock industries consume 8% of the global water supply, with most of that water being used for intensive, feed-based production. This study takes a broad perspective of livestock production as a component of the human food chain, and considers the efficiency of its water use. Global models are in the early stages of development and do not distinguish between developing and developed countries, or the production systems within them. However, preliminary indications are that, when protein production is adjusted for biological value in the human diet, no plant protein is significantly more efficient at using water than protein produced from eggs, and only soybean is more water efficient than milk and goat and chicken meat. In some regions, especially developing countries, animals are not used solely for food production but also provide draught power, fibre and fertiliser for crops. In addition, animals make use of crop by-products that would otherwise go to waste. The livestock sector is the fastest-growing agricultural sector, which has led to increasing industrialisation and, in some cases, reduced environmental constraints. In emerging economies, increasing involvement in livestock is related to improving rural wealth and increasing consumption of animal protein. Water usage for livestock production should be considered an integral part of agricultural water resource management, taking into account the type of production system (e.g. grain-fed or mixed crop livestock) and scale (intensive or extensive), the species and breeds of livestock, and the social and cultural aspects of livestock farming in various countries.

Performance of groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) cultivars for higher productivity in hilly ecosystem	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						"Agronomical traits; Jhum; North East India; Physiological traits; Rainfed groundnut"	"EASTERN HIMALAYAN REGION; L.; QUALITY; GROWTH; YIELD"	Low productive cereals (rice and maize/mixed cropping) in the Jhum degraded abiotic stressed soils (from acidity and moisture deficit) of rainfed hilly ecosystem of Northeast India (NEI) restrict jhumias socio-economic upliftment. Shift in cropping pattern to stress-tolerant groundnut cultivars may provide an option in such a situation. We evaluated the performance of 26 improved cultivars of groundnut for four consecutive years (2013-2016) in terms of suitable agronomic and physiological traits for higher productivity in such soils under rainfed hilly ecosystem of NEI (Manipur) and compared their performances with one popular local check (JL-24). Few improved cultivars (GG-21, TG 37-A, GG-11, TKG-19-A, ICGV-86590 and ICGS-76) yielded significantly (P<0.05) higher (2.72 to 3.35 t/ha) than the local check (2.09 t/ha), primarily because of their better agronomic (leaf area and root dry weight) and physiological (nodulation, chlorophyll and proline contents) traits. Higher agronomical and physiological attributes also led higher production of biomass (above and below ground) than other cultivars. More carbon addition from higher biomass of these cultivars will help in restoration of soil health while higher pod productivity will improve socio-economy of the jhumias. These few selected, sensitive agronomic and physiological traits, thus, can be explored for selection of suitable groundnut cultivars, highly productive yet adaptive and restorative to Jhum degraded acid soils in the rainfed hilly ecosystem of NEI as well as in other such similar agro-ecological regions.

The Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) has been used successfully for accurate estimations of ETa in different river basins throughout the world. In this study, we examined the application of SEBS using publically available remote sensing data to assess spatial variations in water consumption and to map water stress from daily to annual scales in the IBIS. Ground-based ETa was calculated by the advection-aridity method, from nine meteorological sites, and used to evaluate the intra-annual seasonality in the hydrological year 2009-2010. In comparison with the advection-aridity, SEBS computed daily ETa was slightly underestimated with a bias of -0.15mmday(-1) during the kharif (wet; April-September) season, and it was overestimated with a bias of 0.23mmday(-1) in the rabi (dry; October-March) season. Monthly values of the ETa estimated by SEBS were significantly (P<0.05) controlled by mean air temperature and rainfall, among other climatological variables (relative humidity, sunshine hours and wind speed). Because of the seasonal (kharif and rabi) differences in the water and energy budget in the huge canal command areas of the IBIS, ETa and rainfall were positively correlated in the kharif season and were negatively correlated during the rabi season. In addition, analysis of the evaporation process showed that mixed-cropping and rice-wheat dominated areas had lower and higher water consumption rates, respectively, in comparison with other cropping systems in the basin. Basin areas under water stress were identified by means of spatial variations in the relative evapotranspiration, which had an average value of 0.59 and 0.42 during the kharif and the rabi seasons, respectively. The hydrological parameters used in this study provide useful information for understanding hydrological processes at different spatial and temporal scales. Results of this study further suggest that the SEBS is useful for evaluation of water resources in semi-arid to arid regions over longer periods, if the data inputs are carefully handled.

The collected data were analyzed using SPSS (2013, version 21) statistical software procedures. The study area is characterized by mixed crop-livestock farming system with high interaction between crop and livestock. Livestock are the mainstay for the farm community with many benefits as sources of draught, meat, milk, income, and manures. Cattle are kept primarily for the purpose of draught power with meat and milk as secondary products, whereas shoats are kept mainly for cash income, manure, meat, and milk. The land holding size per HH was 1.44 ha while the herd size was 4.93 tropical livestock unit (TLU). Almost all the land holding (97 %) is allocated for crop cultivation with lesser for forage production (< 1 %) indicating poor attention for fodder harvesting. The cattle herd is composed of local breeds (99 %) with less exotic/crossbred (1 %), indicating that the livestock rearing is practiced using local breed. Crop residues, natural pastures, stubble grazing, hay, and browsing are the main feed resources for animals. The availability and contribution of each feed vary with season and areas. Sorghum stover is the main feed source in the area and followed by maize stover, Eragrostis tef straw, and pulse straws. Crop residues are fed as basal diet with no or less supplementation using local concentrates like Attela and mill by-products. Industrial by-products are rarely used in the livestock feeding system for their high price and less availability. Likewise, improved forages are not widely utilized as feed sources.

Around the third millennium BC in the Zhengluo region of China, settlement hierarchies with two or three-tiered settlements were established. However, the detailed economic dynamics of settlement stratification in this area have not yet been clearly illustrated. In this paper, we report the new human isotopic data and archaeobotanical evidences with radiocarbon dates from archaeological sites of different scales in the Zhengluo region. The primary objective is to further assess the manner in which human populations among different scales of settlements in the Zhengluo region organized their subsistence strategies during the late Yangshao period (around 3500BC-2600BCE) by combining these new data with pre-vious archaeological studies.Mixed crop cultivation including millet crops and non-millet crops (rice and/or soybean) was a stable agri-cultural pattern in center settlements, and pure millet agricultural only appeared in ordinary settlements. Meanwhile, human dietary patterns from center settlements were more diversified compared with the homog-enous diets among inhabitants of the ordinary settlements. The distinct human dietary patterns at these two different types of sites results from and reflect their different responses of subsistence strategies to social dy-namics. As settlements expanded and populations increased, stable millet cultivation guaranteed the essential food supply, and that the popularization of rice (a crop from the South) and the adoption of a new crop, soy-beans, could diversify the agricultural patterns, expand the food supply and reduce the risks associated with food production in center settlements. Meanwhile, ordinary settlements still persisted with a more conservative subsistence strategy focused on millet agriculture. The different and successful coping strategies by late Yangshao inhabitants in Zhengluo region were the driving force in the emergence of the episode of peak social development in this area and likely important for populations and settlements in the following revolutionary periods Longshan-Erlitou in the same area.

Vegetation index-based crop coefficients to estimate evapotranspiration by remote sensing in agricultural and natural ecosystems	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						"MODIS; Landsat; reflectance-based crop coefficients; irrigation scheduling; hydrological cycle; climate change studies"	"LOWER COLORADO RIVER; RIPARIAN EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; POTENTIAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; EDDY COVARIANCE; EMPIRICAL ALGORITHM; GROUND MEASUREMENTS; LEAF-AREA; WATER-USE; SAP FLUX; MODIS"	Crop coefficients were developed to determine crop water needs based on the evapotranspiration (ET) of a reference crop under a given set of meteorological conditions. Starting in the 1980s, crop coefficients developed through lysimeter studies or set by expert opinion began to be supplemented by remotely sensed vegetation indices (VI) that measured the actual status of the crop on a field-by-field basis. VIs measure the density of green foliage based on the reflectance of visible and near infrared (NIR) light from the canopy, and are highly correlated with plant physiological processes that depend on light absorption by a canopy such as ET and photosynthesis. Reflectance-based crop coefficients have now been developed for numerous individual crops, including corn, wheat, alfalfa, cotton, potato, sugar beet, vegetables, grapes and orchard crops. Other research has shown that VIs can be used to predict ET over fields of mixed crops, allowing them to be used to monitor ET over entire irrigation districts. VI-based crop coefficients can help reduce agricultural water use by matching irrigation rates to the actual water needs of a crop as it grows instead of to a modeled crop growing under optimal conditions. Recently, the concept has been applied to natural ecosystems at the local, regional and continental scales of measurement, using time-series satellite data from the MODIS sensors on the Terra satellite. VIs or other visible-NIR band algorithms are combined with meteorological data to predict ET in numerous biome types, from deserts, to arctic tundra, to tropical rainforests. These methods often closely match ET measured on the ground at the global FluxNet array of eddy covariance moisture and carbon flux towers. The primary advantage of VI methods for estimating ET is that transpiration is closely related to radiation absorbed by the plant canopy, which is closely related to VIs. The primary disadvantage is that they cannot capture stress effects or soil evaporation. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The results show important behavior variations among the different legumes. The amount of aerial biomass built from August until the first frost achieve between 0.4 and 5.9 t DM/ha. From 377 to 850 degrees-days are necessary to reach 50 % of soil cover. The nitrogen accumulated by the legumes is mainly due to symbiotic nitrogen fixation and vary from a few kg to 150 kg N/ha. The ability of legumes to compete with weeds is closely correlated with the amount of biomass produced (R-2 = 0.93). It is analogous to the aptitude of association tested on legumes in mixtures with oat and phacelia. Five species (grass pea, faba bean, hairy vetch, common vetch and pea) are found to be very dominant and reach more than 80 % of biomass in mixture with phacelia and about 70 % with oat. These species are also those producing the highest biomass, covering soil most rapidly, and fixing high quantity of nitrogen. Many other legumes (fenugreek, lentil, white lupin, soybean, berseem clover, persian clover, crimson clover, hungarian vetch) show less competitive performance and offer a good complement for species associations.

However, there are limited quantitative data on the effect of cereal-legume intercropping on weed species diversity. A study was conducted in the Guinea savanna zone of Ghana to evaluate the effect of maize-soybean intercropping on yield productivity and weed species control. The treatments used include three maize maturity types (extra-early: Abontem, early: Sammaz 27 and medium: Obatanpa) intercropped with soybean at three intraspacing (10, 20 and 30 cm), and their sole crop treatments were laid in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Results showed that the land equivalent ratio (LER) for the intercrops was above 1, indicating better intercrop productivity than the sole crops. An average of 40% land was saved for the intercrops compared with the sole crops. Intercropping Sammaz 27 maize with soybean significantly increased LER by 9% compared to the other types. Intercropping maize with soybean significantly reduced weed biomass at 6 and 9 weeks after planting (WAP) and at harvest relative to the sole maize. The weed biomass at 6 and 9 WAP and harvest increased (p < .05) with increasing soybean intraspacing. The grass and broadleaf weed species count at 6 WAP and harvest from the sole crops were significantly higher than that of the intercrops. The results suggest that intercropping early maize maturity type with soybean at 10 cm intraspacing could be used to increase grain yield, LER and control of grass and broadleaf weeds in a maize-based cropping system in the Guinea savanna zones of West Africa.

It is important to assess such impacts to devise effective management plans. A field survey study was carried out to assess the socio-economic effects of a highly invasive plant species, parthenium weed (Parthenium hysterophorus L.) across the three different cropping regions in Punjab province of Pakistan. The farming communities of different cropping regions reported significant effects of parthenium weed on their crop and livestock production, health and social well-being. The mixed cropping region was heavily infested and most affected region, whereas the cotton-wheat region was least affected. Farmers were well-aware of parthenium weed presence, its biology, habitat, and mode of dispersal across the landscape. All the major crops cultivated were infested by varying degrees of weed densities with potato, sugarcane and maize being the most infested crops. Farmers were generally good at managing the weed in crops which cost them significant amounts of money (ca. $205 per household). Parthenium weed also infested the fodder collection and grazing sites affecting the livestock production negatively. Each farmer lost an additional ca. $935 annually due to the weed infestations on fodder collection sites. A significant proportion of farmers also reported negative effects of the weed on animal health (22-36%) and human health (14-24%). The average annual costs associated with animal health and human health were ca. $2031 and $73 per household, respectively. Despite acknowledging the value of weed management in non-cropped areas, fewer farmers managed it practically in such areas. Most farmers reported parthenium weed as a very difficult-to-manage weed. About 37% of farmers were willing while 60% were likely to participate in a potential management program in future. A comprehensive management strategy is urgently needed to address the looming crisis of parthenium weed invasion across the province and similar approach must be implemented at the national and international level.

(Ostro, Altgold, KR 489-11-15, Oberkulmer, Ostroschwarzer, Lueg, H 9227, H 9228, Rouquin, Hercule), and common wheat Triticum aestivum L. (variety Samara) were cultivated in Ceske Budejovice during the years 1996 to 1998 in the low-input system. The forecrop was mixed crops and no N fertilization was applied after forecrop harvesting. Chemical composition was analyzed in wheat and spelt grains: content of N compounds was determined according to Kjeldahl, fat content according to Soxhlet, fibre content according to Scharrer and Kurschner, P content according to Lorenc, and contents of ash compounds and metals ions (Cu, Zn, Mg, Ca, K, Na, Fe) were determined using AAS. Spelt wheat had in low-input system better resorption ability than common wheat. Statistically significant differences were detected in ash content, and Zn and P contents. Average content of N compounds in spelt grain was about 0.5% higher than in common wheat grain. Old Swiss varieties Ostro and Oberkulmer, and also new breeding material KR 489-11-15 had a little bit higher content of N compounds. Also fibre content was in spelt wheat 0.35% higher than in common wheat. Generally it is possible to recommend spelt wheat for growing in low-input system according to its better utilization of nutrients and higher content of minerals. Older spelt varieties (Ostro, Oberkulmer) and new breeding material KR 489-11-15 have higher contents of fat and N compounds, and are therefore more suitable for low-input system.

A major constraint to the adoption of CA is crop residue management in mixed crop-livestock systems. Farmers have competing uses of crop residues - for soil cover, as fodder or as additional income source - which may explain low CA adoption rates in some countries. This paper describes the social and income trade-offs of different crop residue uses in Mexico at regional, community and household level associated with the introduction of CA. We first spatially analyze the importance of crop residues for fodder supply and identify municipalities with fodder surplus at national and regional level. Second, we assess the likely social trade-offs and implications for farming communities of changing a typical farm households' residue allocation. Third, we identify the effects of crop residue uses on gross margins of maize and barley and assess the economic optimal crop residue allocation at the farm level with short planning horizons. The paper focuses on maize and barley producers in the central Mexican highlands and combines primary quantitative and qualitative data with secondary data. Analysis shows that at a national level, Mexico has a fodder surplus while the central highlands have a deficit. Crop residues are a major fodder source in Mexico, contributing up to 40% of fodder availability. Crop residues are also an important income source which implies costs for introducing CA in the central highlands. Our analysis indicates that retaining crop residues in-situ influences gross margins and that retention of roughly 45% of residues maximizes gross margins in situations where opportunity costs for the use of crop residues exist. Partial residue retention, sequential introduction and combination of technologies may facilitate CA uptake but CA remains a challenge for resource-poor farmers given their limited liquidity, risky production environment and difficulty to forego current income for future benefits. More interdisciplinary research is needed around economic optimal residue retention levels under different farming and production conditions, to identify the ecological needed minimum cover of crop residues for CA and to develop alternative low-cost sustainable technologies with short-term benefits.

Integration of legumes into maize-based cropping systems is advocated as a means to increase production of diverse nutrient-dense grains and improve soil fertility. It is difficult to achieve both aims simultaneously, however. Short-duration grain legumes rarely produce enough biomass to appreciatively improve soils, and long duration pigeonpea, commonly grown in Malawi as a dual purpose crop, produces little or no edible grain as a consequence of grain-filling into the dry season. A novel technology is the doubled-up legume rotation (DLR) system in which two legumes with complementary phenology are intercropped and grown in rotation with maize. Initial performance from on-farm research is favorable; however, it is crucial to understand competition for resources in mixed cropping systems under variable soil and climate conditions. We used soil and crop yield data from farmer participatory trials to parameterize the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and evaluate its performance in simulating observed treatments at three locations in central Malawi. We used the calibrated APSIM model to investigate the performance of DLR and other maize-based systems across 26 growing seasons (1979-2005) in the three agroecologies. We simulated two DLR systems (maize rotated with a groundnut/pigeonpea or soybean/pigeonpea intercrop), maize rotated with groundnut or soybean, maize intercropped with pigeonpea, and continuous maize under a range of N fertilizer inputs. We extended findings to the household level by determining calorie and protein yields of these systems, and calculating the chance that an average household could meet their food requirements by dedicating all available farmland to a given system. Simulated maize grain yields in DLR and maize-grain legume rotations were essentially equivalent, and exceeded yields in maize/pigeonpea intercrop and sole cropped maize receiving comparable fertility inputs. All rotation systems were more likely to meet household calorie and protein needs than other systems receiving equivalent inputs. DLR systems accumulated higher total soil C and N over time than traditional rotation systems in areas where pigeonpea performed well. However, the effects of improved soil fertility on maize yields were counterbalanced by factors including N immobilization and water availability. We conclude that where growing conditions allow, DLR can harness the complementary phenology of pigeonpea to build soil quality for the future without reducing maize yields or compromising household food production in the immediate term.

The crop residues were amended with animal dung; and three types of vermibeds were prepared: (i) millet straw (S. vulgare+Pennisenum typhoides in equal quantity)+sheep manure (1:2 ratio) (MS), (ii) pulse bran (Vigna radiata)+wheat straw (Triticum aestivum)+cow dung (1:1:2 ratio) (PWC), and (iii) mixed crop residues (mixing of all types crop residues, used in this study) +cow dung in 1:1 ratio (MCR+CD). The fourth treatment was cattle shed manure (CSM). At the end, ready vermicompost showed lower organic C content and higher concentrations of other important plant nutrients. Organic C content decreased in the order: MCR+CD (27.6%) > PWC (22.8%) > CMS (22.6%) > MS (19.4%). The ready vermicompost obtained from MCR+CD vermibed showed the maximum increase (% of initial level) in content of total N (143.4%), available P (111.1%) and exchangeable K (100.0%). The end product showed reduction in C:N ration between the ranges of 60.7% (CSM) and 70.3% (MCR+CD), at the end. The composting earthworm E. eugeniae exhibited the highest values of biological parameters: maximum mean individual biomass (1261.25 +/- 7.0 mg), biomass gain (955.84 +/- 11.03 mg), growth rate (10.62 +/- 0.10 mgwt. worm(-1) day(-1)), cocoon numbers (87.67 +/- 6.51), and reproduction rate (0.66 +/- 0.01 cocoons worm(-1) day(-1)) in CSM container, while MS vermibeds showed the lowest values of these parameters. During experimentation, the maximum mortality for E. eugeniae was recorded in MS (16.67 +/- 7.63%) followed by CSM > PWC > MCR+CD. Results indicated that the C:N ratio of the substrate drastically influenced the growth parameters of E. eugeniae, and it showed the close relations with maximum individual biomass gain (R-2 = 0.96), individual growth rate (R-2 = 0.82), and reproduction rate (cocoon worm(-1) day(-1)) (R-2 = 0.72), in different treatments. This study clearly indicates that vermicomposting of crop residues and cattle shed wastes can not only produce a value-added product (vermicomposting) but at the same time acts as best culture medium for large-scale production of earthworms.

The term agrarian refers to a respondent who has formal education in agricultural sciences (agronomy, soil science, agricultrual economics, and horticulture etc.), otherwise known as non-agrarian. In 2009 the Punjab government allotted agricultural plots to agrarians. A multistage sampling technique was used to collect data of 384 crop growers by using well-structured questionnaire from two main cop zones of Punjab province of Pakistan. From July to September 2017, the data of rice and sugarcane were collected from mixed crop zone, and cotton and wheat from cotton-wheat crop zone. Various econometric methods were used to approach study objectives. Results found that compared to non-agrarians, crop productivity of wheat, rice, cotton, and sugarcane was 28.9, 23.4, 19.8, and 8.3%, higher at agrarians' farms, respectively. Agricultural education and recommended use of farm inputs were main factors of getting higher crop yield at agrarians' farms. Artificial neural network (ANN) reported that at agrarian plots, farm inputs, particularly Pure N, Pure P, Pure K, and seed rate were used at recommended level for wheat, cotton, rice, and sugarcane crop. The overuse of Pure N and seed rate and underuse of Pure P, Pure K and farmyard manure (FYM) were found the main reasons for getting lower crop yield at non-agrarians' farms. Moreover, Cobb-Douglas (CD) production function evident that, although the farming experience of non-agrarians significantly increased the crop productivity, excessive use of Pure N and seed rate and non-agricultural education have no significant impact on crop yield. On the other hand, propensity score matching (PSM) method confirmed that public policy of land allotment to agrarians has significanity increased the yield of wheat, rice, cotton, and sugarcane by 16.5, 14.2, 12.3, and 23.2%, respectively. The study results suggested that besides of land allotment to agrarians, the government should also focus on the provision of formal and informal agricultural education and training to non-agrarians. More specifically, it is necessary to provide knowledge of basic crop production technology to non-agrarians. Furthermore, to exploit maxim crop yield it is highly suggested to apply fertilizers at the recommend level estimated by the ANN method.

Field experiments showed that pastures ploughed in early autumn (March) and left fallow accumulated 107-142 kg ha(-1) N of mineral-N in the soil profile by the start of winter, with 72-106 kg ha(-1) N lost through leaching in the first winter. Delaying the ploughing of pasture until late autumn (May) reduced the accumulation of mineral-N to 42-120 kg ha(-1) N and the leaching loss to 8-52 kg ha(-1) N. In situations where early cultivation cannot be avoided, growing winter cover crops or using the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) both have the potential to reduce leaching compared with fallow soil. DCD increased the amount of mineral-N present in the soil as ammonium and reduced leaching losses by 25-50% without affecting the yield of the following spring wheat crop. Cover crops only reduced leaching losses (by up to 60%) when they were sown early in the autumn and they had taken up considerable amounts of soil mineral-N before drainage occurred. When cover crops were grazed before incorporation in spring, there was an increased risk of leaching from urine patch areas. If residues were incorporated without grazing, however, the yield of the following spring wheat crop was depressed by 20-30% due to extensive net N immobilization during decomposition of the residues. In Canterbury conditions, the most reliable way to minimise N leaching losses is to delay the ploughing of pasture for as long as possible in autumn or winter. Where pastures are ploughed early, the relative effectiveness of using DCD or growing winter cover crops varies mainly in relation to rainfall distribution.

However, little attention has been paid to rhizosphere effects at an agro-ecosystem level. This paper presents recent research on the rhizosphere processes in relation to plant nutrition in main cropping systems in China. In the peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.)/maize (Zea mays L.) intercropping system, maize was found to improve the Fe nutrition of peanut through influencing its rhizosphere processes, suggesting an important role of phytosiderophores released from Fe-deficient maize. Intercropping between maize and faba bean (Vicia faba L.) was found to improve nitrogen and phosphorus uptake in the two crops compared with corresponding sole crop. There was a higher land equivalent ratio (LER) in the intercropping system of maize and faba bean than the treatment of no root interactions between the two crops. The increased yield of maize intercropped with faba bean resulted from an interspecific facilitation in nutrient uptake, depending on interspecific root interactions of the two crops. In the rotation system of rice (Oryza sativa L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crops, Mn deficiency in wheat was caused by excessive Mn uptake by rice and Mn leaching from topsoil to subsoil due to periodic cycles of flooding and drying. However, wheat genotypes tolerant to Mn deficiency tended to distribute more roots to deeper soil layer and thus expand their rhizosphere zones in the Mn-deficient soils and utilize Mn from the subsoil. Deep ploughing also helped root penetration into subsoil and was propitious to correcting Mn deficiency in wheat rotated with rice. In comparison, oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) took up more Mn than wheat through mobilizing sparingly soluble soil Mn due to acidification and reduction processes in the rhizosphere. Thus, oilseed rape was tolerant to the Mn-deficient conditions in the rice-oilseed rape rotation. Oxidation reactions on root surface of rice also resulted in the formation of Fe plaque in the rice rhizosphere. Large amounts of Zn were accumulated on the Fe plaque. Zinc uptake by rice plants increased as Fe plaque formed, but decreased at high amounts of Fe plaque. It is suggested that to fine-tune cropping patterns and optimize nutrient management based on a better understanding of rhizosphere processes at an agro-ecosystem level is crucial for increasing nutrient use efficiency and developing sustainable agriculture in China.

Currently, the local seed system is limited to landraces and hybrids that are primarily used for domestic grain and fodder purposes. This study aimed to understand the farmers' needs and context, and use this knowledge to deliver relevant, adoptable climate-smart sorghum crop technologies through farmer-participatory approaches (FPAs). We conducted an ex-ante survey with 103 farmer households to understand their preferences and constraints concerning sorghum, their staple food-crop. Farmers expressed taste as the most important characteristic, followed by stover yield, grain yield, drought adaptation, and pest resistance. They identified fodder deficit, loss of seed purity in landraces, and lack of diverse sorghum seed options as critical constraints. Therefore, we chose dual-purpose, open-pollinated sorghum varieties suitable for postrainy/rabi cultivation as the study site's entry point. Accordingly, sixteen popular rabi sorghum varieties were tested at ICRISAT station (2017-18 and 2018-19) for agronomic performance in field conditions under a range of treatments (irrigation and fertilization). The standing crop was also scored by farmer representatives. Additionally, the detailed lysifield study elucidated the plant functions underlying the crop agronomic performance under water stress (plant water use and stay-green score) and an important trait of farmer's interest (relation between stay-green score and in-vitro stover digestibility and relation between grain fat and protein content) The selected varieties- Phule Chitra, CSV22, M35-1 and preferred landrace (Sevata jonna)-were further tested with 21 farmers at Adilabad (2018-20). Participating farmers from both the trials and focus group discussions voiced their preference and willingness to adopt Phule Chitra and CSV22. This article summarizes how system-relevant crop options were selected for subsistence farmers of Adilabad and deployed using participatory approaches. While varieties are developed for wider adoption, farmers adopt only those suitable for their farm, household, and accessible market. Therefore, we strongly advocate FPA for developing and delivering farmer relevant crop technologies as a vehicle to systematically break crop adoption barriers and create a positive impact on household diets, well-being, and livelihoods, especially for smallholder subsistence farmers.

The cycling of biomass through ruminant livestock into dung (faeces) and urine that fertilize the soil has long been an important factor in the nutrient cycling processes of these integrated, mixed crop/livestock systems. While dung greatly improves soil properties and crop yields, little is known about the effects of urine on soil chemical properties and the impact of dung and urine on crop production. An average voiding of sheep urine applied to a sandy, siliceous soil in the Republic of Niger increased soil pH, available phosphorus and ammonium levels dramatically in the upper 10-15 cm of soil, especially during the first week following application. Losses of applied urine nitrogen via volatilization were in the order of 30-50%. A four-year field trial was conducted on the same soil type to evaluate the effects on pearl millet and weed yields of corralling cattle or sheep overnight on cropland (dung plus urine application) for one, two or three nights, every one, two or three years versus the effects of applying only dung at the same application rates and intervals achieved with corralling. The main results of this field trial were that (1) urine had large positive effects on millet grain, threshed panicle, leaf, stem and weed yields, (2) sheep dung was more effective than cattle dung in increasing yield, (3) two nights of dung application was adequate for maximum yield and (4) the positive effects of dung and urine on yield lasted two to three cropping seasons after application.

To address this hypothesis, we assessed the grain yield stability of various barley-pea and wheat-faba bean mixtures grown in seven experimental field trials (locations) across Europe during two years with contrasting weather (2017 and 2018). Three different yield stability measures were used, all based on the expected yield variability of the mixture components grown as sole crops, and the corresponding observed yield variability of the same components grown in 50:50 mixtures in a replacement design. Stability indices were calculated as ratios between the expected and observed variabilities, with values > 1 indicating greater stability of the intercrops. Mean grain yields tended to be higher in intercrops than sole crops. However, in contrast to our hypothesis, the observed (intercrop) yield stability was similar or lower than the expected (sole crop) stability in most locations except one. Furthermore, yield stability significantly increased with increasing mean yields when assessed across differentially productive locations. The results are relevant for the designing of intercropping systems as a means to increase yield stability and the resilience of cropping systems.

With expansion of arable land and resultant decline in grazing resources, crop residues are becoming an increasingly important component of livestock feeds. This demand for livestock feeds has implications for the long-term sustainability of such systems since failure to return biomass to soils has implications for soil quality and the capacity of soils to support long-term productivity. Biomass allocation patterns are likely to vary with overall level of productivity and hence availability. In this study we used a household survey to quantify crop residue allocation patterns across a gradient of productivity in Eastern Africa focusing on two sites in Ethiopia and one in Kenya. We assessed the underlying determinants of crop residue allocation patterns with a view to understanding how productivity increases through intensification will influence biomass allocation in Eastern Africa and how livelihood and natural resource management objectives could be optimized. Results showed that farmers strongly favour allocation of residues to livestock feeding but that allocation to soil increases along the productivity gradient. This reduced feeding to livestock and increased allocation to soil fertility is associated with smaller farm sizes leading to reduced animal traction needs for tillage, increased overall livestock productivity, increased use of inputs and a reduced reliance on farm-based activities in overall livelihood strategies. The implications of these trends are that productivity increases in smallholder systems are likely to reduce pressure on biomass in the long term and that measures that enhance the prospects for farmers to intensify their production systems are likely to increase soil health and sustainability objectives in general. A key conclusion of the work is that intensification of livestock production could reduce crop residue allocation to soils with long term implications for soil productivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Maris Bead), sugar beet (Beta vulgaris, cv. Monoire), forage maize (Zea mays, cv. Leader), forage peas (Pisum sativum, cv. Poneka) and white turnip (Brassica campestris, cv. Barkant) to topsoil compaction was investigated in a three year trial. Soil compaction was induced by tractor wheeling after crop sowing. Compaction reduced leaf area and dry matter accumulation in all crops in every season. Yield of barley was reduced by 29%, 27% and 40% in 1984, 1986 and 1987 respectively. Yield of maize, peas and turnip decreased by 33%, 14% and 13% in 1986 and 25%, 16% and 19% in 1987. Yields of beans and sugar beet were decreased by 34% and 35% respectively in 1984. Light interception was decreased in all crops in all three years of study but, with the exception of maize in 1987, the efficiency of conversion of radiant energy to dry matter was not significantly affected by soil compaction. It is concluded that reduced dry matter production and yield due to soil compaction was more a consequence of reduced light interception because of restricted leaf area development rather than as a result of an impaired ability of crops to utilise intercepted radiant energy.

A model simulation analysis of soil nitrate concentrations - Does soil organic matter pool structure or catch crop growth parameters matter most?	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						"daisy; soil organic matter; modelling; catch crop modelling"	"TERM CARBON; CN-SIM; TURNOVER; DAISY; DYNAMICS; SYSTEM"	Three different soil organic matter (SOM) submodels were tested within the framework of the soil-plant-atmosphere model Daisy The three submodels were: the original Daisy SOM module (OLD) with relatively non-dynamic humus pools, a recalibrated Daisy SOM module (STD) with the same pool structure as the original, but with a more rapid turnover of the active humus pool, and a newly developed SOM model structure (CNSIM), with inclusion of a soil microbial residuals pool of relatively rapid turnover, and a relatively recalcitrant added organic matter pool, producing a larger and more sustained residual N mineralisation. Furthermore, two different parameterisations of the catch crop submodules, differing in grass growth and N assimilation dynamics, were tested and the relative influence of SOM module or catch crop growth module on the simulated variables assessed. The simulations were carried out with data from a field experiment with four mixed cropping systems and compared to measured results of crop production, N uptake and soil nitrate concentration. The cropping sequence was 3 years of grassland (cut or grazed) followed by 3 years of spring cereals with ryegrass as a catch crop and two levels of fertiliser application. Independently of the SOM module, plant production and nitrogen uptake for cereals were simulated well. The dynamics of the added organic matter (AOM) and SOM of the two Daisy submodules were nearly identical, whereas the CNSIM submodule built much more nitrogen into the AOM pools, especially during the pasture years. During the period with spring barley, the CNSIM module simulated similar amounts of AOM as the other modules. In general, the simulated nitrate concentrations at 100 cm depth were higher than the measured values, but the changed dynamics in the CNSIM simulations resulted in even higher overestimation of the nitrate concentration than the two other modules. T he choice of catch crop submodule had a considerable effect on nitrate concentration and therefore the potential for nitrate leaching, possibly overshading more futile differences produced by the different SOM submodules. The simulations show the importance of applying appropriate intercrop submodels when the model is used for simulating rotations with intercropping of grass-clover or undersown catch crops.

In order to cut back these P losses over the long term, soil P stocks need to be drastically reduced. Greenhouse experiments have shown that a rapid reduction of the plant available P pool is attained by reducing the P fertilizer input to zero while cropping, but field trials confirming these findings are rare. Moreover, important additional questions arise in any P mining strategy: (i) to what extent will crop performance be affected in high P soils under 0 P fertilization, (ii) which crops reduce soil P stocks most efficiently and (iii) how can soil organic carbon (SOC) levels be maintained when organic fertilizers are no longer applied. In order to address these questions we set up two 0 P fertilization field trials at sites with a very high initial soil P status (i.e. a P saturation degree > 30%). On each site, we compared the effect of 0 P fertilization on crop yield, soil P status and SOC level to a business as usual scenario, for two crop rotations. At the first site, a comparison was made between a mixed crop rotation with or without the inclusion of a catch crop. At the second site, a comparison was made between an arable/grass and a vegetable crop rotation. Four consecutive years of 0 P fertilization had no effect on neither the crop yield nor the crop P uptake. Further, English ryegrass, silage maize, celeriac and Chinese cabbage made the largest contribution to P removal. Although 0 P fertilization reduced the P balance at field level with 102-121 kg P ha(-1) over four years, this had no significant (measurable) effect yet on the soil P stocks. Continuation of these experiments over a longer time will thus be needed to allow to see any such effects. Simulations of the evolution of the SOC levels over a thirty-year period showed that the use of grass as green manure or as main crop only allows to partially maintain the SOC levels in the absence of any organic fertilizers. These results indicate that P mining is a challenging task, that will take a long time to reduce the soil P stocks and that will come at a cost for the farmer.

However, there are few published reports on soil fertility in intercropping relative to monocultures. A field experiment was therefore established in 2009 in Gansu province, northwest China. The treatments comprised maize/faba bean, maize/soybean, maize/chickpea and maize/turnip intercropping, and their correspoding monocropping. In 2011 (the 3rd year) and 2012 (the 4th year) the yields and some soil chemical properties and enzyme activities were examined after all crop species were harvested or at later growth stages. Both grain yields and nutrient acquisition were significantly greater in all four intercropping systems than corresponding monocropping over two years. Generally, soil organic matter (OM) did not differ significantly from monocropping but did increase in maize/chickpea in 2012 and maize/turnip in both years. Soil total N (TN) did not differ between intercropping and monocropping in either year with the sole exception of maize/faba bean intercropping receiving 80 kg P ha(-1) in 2011. Intercropping significantly reduced soil Olsen-P only in 2012, soil exchangeable K in both years, soil cation exchangeable capacity (CEC) in 2012, and soil pH in 2012. In the majority of cases soil enzyme activities did not differ across all the cropping systems at different P application rates compared to monocrops, with the exception of soil acid phosphatase activity which was higher in maize/legume intercropping than in the corresponding monocrops at 40 kg ha(-1) P in 2011. P fertilization can alleviate the decline in soil Olsen-P and in soil CEC to some extent. In summary, intercropping enhanced productivity and maintained the majority of soil fertility properties for at least three to four years, especially at suitable P application rates.The results indicate that maize-based intercropping may be an efficient cropping system for sustainable agriculture with carefully managed fertilizer inputs.

The use of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) strains to boost the yield of intercrops constitutes a promising tool in agricultural practice. This study investigated the impact of single inoculation and co-inoculation with PGPR on plant biomass and phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) concentrations under different cropping systems. Two PGPR strains with different traits were selected: PGP13 (Rahnella aquatilis) and PS11 (Pseudomonas sp.). A greenhouse experiment was designed using durum wheat (Triticum durum L.) and faba bean (Vicia faba L.), sole cropped or intercropped, including four inoculation treatments: (i) uninoculated, (ii) inoculated with PS11 (iii) inoculated with PGP13, and (iv) co-inoculated with PS11 + PGP13. Co-inoculation under the intercropping system improved plant dry matter and enhanced bean pod and wheat spike weights to 685.83% and 385.83%, respectively, of the values for uninoculated, intercropped plants. Higher P and N concentrations were detected in intercropped, co-inoculated plants and in bean pods and wheat spikes. The results were then submitted to principal component analysis, showing that treatments with higher biomass and nutrient concentrations were strongly correlated with intercropped, co-inoculated plants.

Fertilizers, hybrids, and the sustainable intensification of maize systems in the rainfed mid-hills of Nepal	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"Yield gap; Precision nutrient management; Sustainable intensification; Domain-specific recommendation"	"SOIL FERTILITY; CROPPING SYSTEMS; YIELD GAPS; NUTRIENT; RICE; WATER; PRODUCTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; FARMERS"	In the rainfed mid-hill region of Nepal, most fields receive 2-3 t ha(-1) of organic compost application every year. Despite efficient recovery and use of organics in the mixed crop-animal systems that predominant in the mid-hills, depleted soil fertility is widely understood to be a significant constraint to crop productivity, with most farmers achieving maize grain yields below 2 t ha(-1). Increased use of fertilizer may arrest and even reverse long-term soil quality degradation, but few farmers in the mid-hills use them at present and existing recommendations are insufficiently responsive to site, varietal, and management factors that influence the productivity and profitability of increased fertilizer use. Moreover, policy makers and development practitioners often hold the perception that returns to fertilizer use in the mid-hills are too low to merit investment. In this study, on-farm experiments were conducted at 16 sites in the Palpa district, Nepal to assess the responsiveness of a maize hybrid (DKC 9081) and an 'improved' open pollinated maize variety ('OPV', Manakamana-3) to four nitrogen (N) rates, i.e., 0, 60,120 and 180 kg ha(-1), with each N rate response evaluated at 30:30 and 60:60 kg ha(-1) rates of phosphorus (P2O5) and potassium (K2O), respectively. With sound agronomy and high rates of fertilizer (180:60:60 kg N:P2O5:K2O ha(-1)), grain yields observed in the field experiments exceeded 8 t ha(-1) with hybrids and 6 t ha(-1) with OPV. Yield levels were lower for OPV than hybrid at every level of applied N, but both genotypes responded linearly to N with partial factor productivity for N (PFPN) ranging from 14 to 19 for OPV versus 26-30 for hybrid, with improved N efficiencies obtained when P and K rates were significantly higher. Averaged across phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) levels, a $ I incremental investment in fertilizer increased the gross margin (GM) by $ 1.70 ha(-1) in OPV and by $ 1.83 ha(-1) in the hybrid. For the full response of N, requires higher rate of P2O5:K2O and vice-versa and full response to P2O5:1(20 does not occur if N is absent. These results suggest that, i) degraded soils in the mid-hills of Nepal respond favorably to macronutrient fertilizers - even at high rates, ii) balanced fertilization is necessary to optimize returns on investments in N but must be weighed against additional costs, iii) OPVs benefit from investments in fertilizer, albeit at a PFPN that is 36-47% lower than for hybrids, and, consequently iv) hybrids are an effective mechanism for achieving a higher return on fertilizer investments, even when modest rates are applied. To extend these findings across years and sites in the mid-hills, crop growth simulations using the CERES-maize model (DSSAT) were conducted for 11 districts with historical weather and representative soils data. Average simulated (hybrid) maize yields with high fertilizer rate (180:60:60 kg N:P2O5:K2O ha(-1)) ranged from 3.9 t ha(-1) to 7.5 t ha(-1) across districts, indicating a high disparity in attainable yield potential. By using these values to estimate district-specific attainable yield targets, recommended N fertilizer rates vary between 65 and 208 kg N ha(-1), highlighting the importance of developing domain-specific recommendations. Simulations also suggest the potential utility of using weather forecasts in tandem with site and planting date information to adjust fertilizer recommendations on a seasonal basis.

A mixed forage (timothy-red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and monocrop timothy (Phleum pratense L.) sward I I were fertilized annually with ammonium nitrate (AN) at up to 150kg and 300 N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, from 1998-2001. Organic amendments, applied at up to 600 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in the first two years only, included composts derived from crop residue (CSC), dairy manure (DMC) or sewage sludge (SSLC), plus liquid dairy manure (DM), and supplied C to soil at 4.6 and 9.2 (CSC), 10.9 (SSLC), 10.0 (DMC) 2.9 (DM) Mg C ha-1. Soil samples (0-5cm; 5-10cm; 10-15cm) were recovered in 2000 and 2001. Improvements in soil physical properties (soil bulk density and water content) were obtained for compost treatments alone. Composts alone influenced soil C:N ratio and substantially increased soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration and mass (+ 5.2 to + 9.7 Mg C ha(-1)). Gains in SOC with AN of 2.7 Mg C ha(-1) were detectable by the third crop production year (2001). The lower C inputs, and more labile C, supplied by manure (DM) was reflected in reduced SOC gains (+ 2.5 Mg C ha(-1)) compared to composts. The distribution of C in densiometric light fraction, LF; > 1.7 g cm(-3)) and particulate organic matter (POM; litter (> 2000 mu m); coarse-sand (250-2000 mu m); fine-sand (53-250 mu m) fractions varied with compost and combining fractionation by size and density improved interpretation of compost dynamics in soil. Combined POM accounted for 82.6% of SOC gains with composts. Estimated compost turnover rates (k) ranged from 0.06 (CSC) to 0.09 yr-1 (DMC). Composts alone increased soil microbial biomass carbon (SMB-C) concentration (mu g C g(-1) soil). Soil available C (C-ext) decreased significantly as compost maturity increased. For some composts (CSC), timothy yields matched those obtained with AN, and SOC gains were derived from both applied-C and increased crop residue-C returns to soil. A trend towards improved C returns across all treatments was apparent for the mixed crop. Matching composts of varying quality with the appropriate (legume/non-legume) target crop will be critical to promoting soil C gains from compost use."

In the conventional tillage system a mouldboard plough (CT) was used and in the minimum tillage system it rotary harrow (MT) was employed. The effect of crop density and tillage system on the grain dry matter and grain N yields, N, fixation and soil N uptake were determined to address the following questions: (i) which mixture compositions exhibit the highest grain yields compared to the sole crops, (ii) which mixture compositions also fix a high level of N-2 and leave low levels of residual inorganic soil N after harvest, and (iii) whether the intercrop advantage is influenced by the tillage system. For (i) the result in 2002 showed that the highest grain yields of both sole cropped pea and oat and intercropped pea and oat were achieved at the highest densities. In 2003, when the inorgartic soil N content was higher and weather conditions were warmer and drier, grain yields were significantly higher than in 2002, but sole as well as intercropped pea and oat gave their highest grain yields at lower densities. For both years and tillage systems, the highest intercrop advantages were achieved in mixtures with densities above the optimal sole crop densities. The result for (ii) was that a distinctly higher proportion of nitrogen wits derived from the atmosphere (Ndfa) by intercropped pea than by sole cropped pea. However, the uptake of soil N by intercropped pea and oat was not reduced in comparison with that of sole cropped oat as the decrease in the uptake of N from the soil by oat at lower oat densities in the mixture was compensated for by the soil N uptake of pea. Additionally, the N-min-N content of the soil following the mixtures and sole cropped oat did not differ, especially in the deeper soil layers because oat in mixture was forced to take up more soil N from deeper layers. Therefore, the risk of soil N losses through leaching after mixtures was lower compared to sole cropped pea. The tillage system (iii) had no significant influence on grain yield and soil N uptake, but N, fixation and the competitive ability of intercropped pea were higher under CT than with MT. An additional result was that intercropping led to a significantly increased grain N content of both pea and oat compared to the sole crops. The increase in grain N content from sole to intercrop was from 3.30 to 3.42% for pea and from 1.73 to 1.96% for oat as a mean for both years and tillage systems. The present study confirms that growing pea and oat as intercrops highlights potential economic and environmental benefits which still need to be understood in more detail in order to exploit intercropping to a greater extent.

We developed and implemented a test for this hypothesis.MethodsTwo pot experiments were conducted with quartz sands. In Experiment 1, the ability of the crop species to acquire P from sparingly soluble sources (Ca phosphate (CaP), phytate (PhyP) and P-coated Fe (hydr)oxide (FeP)) was tested. In accordance with the species performances in Experiment 1, combinations of millet/chickpea and cabbage/faba bean (which have dissimilar P acquisition traits) and wheat/maize (which have similar traits) were selected for Experiment 2. The biomass production and P uptake were compared between the sole crops and species combinations as well as between the single and mixed P sources.ResultsA dissimilarity in P acquisition traits enhanced P uptake by millet/chickpea on CaP/PhyP (as expected) but not by cabbage/faba bean on FeP/PhyP. Despite their similar P acquisition traits, we found enhanced P uptake by wheat/maize on CaP/PhyP.ConclusionsBecause of complicating factors such as unstable P acquisition traits and competitive inequality between species, the conditions under which the P resource partitioning hypothesis can be tested are limited. This challenge complicates designing for complementarity in soil P pools by intercrops.

Results showed that proportion of complementary components had significant effect on hay (leaf and stem). The highest leaf dry weight was related to sole cropping of triticale and rough pea (349.8 and 612.3 kg/ha), respectively. Also, stem dry weight by these two treatments (1751 and 715.1 kg/ha). The maximum of biological yield in triticale and rough pea obtained from sole cropping of triticale and combination 40 : 60 was equal to 6492 and 2919 kg/ha, respectively. The results in study treatments showed that under efficacy of different seed combinations, changed dry matter (DM) and its quality, the highest total hay yield (3101 kg/ha) was related to combination 60 : 40. Thus, this treatment was higher than other treatments in quality and total LER (TLER). Therefore, this combination was found the most suitable for forage produce and exploitation of resources.

Systems dynamics and the spatial distribution of methane emissions from African domestic ruminants to 2030	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"methane; livestock systems; livestock populations; climate change; IPCC; Africa; cattle; sheep; goats"	"LIVESTOCK; PREDICTION; OPTIONS; CATTLE; MAIZE"	Livestock production systems in Africa are experiencing rapid changes in structure and function due to increased demands for livestock products from a more prosperous and ever-increasing human population. Some of these changes could lead to increased emissions of greenhouse gases. This paper explores the magnitudes of changes in production systems as a function of increased population densities and climate change. This paper also quantifies the methane emissions from African cattle, goats and sheep from 2000 to 2030. The study integrates methodologies from different disciplines to derive spatially explicit distributions of methane emissions from domestic ruminants and their changes as livestock production systems evolve. A livestock systems classification framework was used to differentiate pastoral and crop-livestock systems using agro-ecological thresholds based on temperature and length of growing period (hyper-arid, arid, humid and temperate regions), the extent of irrigation and human population densities. Livestock numbers (tropical livestock units, TLU) were estimated from FAO data for each country and production system defined. Projections of livestock populations were derived from analysis of demand shifts in livestock products, and livestock systems changes estimated on the basis of potential climate change and population density change to 2030. For the estimation of diets for ruminants, Africa was split into regions (East, West, Southern, Central and North Africa, and The Horn of Africa) and diets for both the rainy and the dry seasons were estimated from literature reviews for each livestock species in each production system in each region. Feed intake, livestock production and the computation of methane emissions were obtained using a previously validated and widely used mechanistic model of digestion and metabolism in ruminants. Results suggest that (1) Africa produced around 7.8 million tonnes of methane/year in 2000. This figure is likely to increase to 11.1 million tonnes/year by 2030. (2) Methane emissions per tropical livestock unit (TLU, 250 kg bodyweight) can vary from 21 to 40 kg/(TLU year), depending on the production system and the region. (3) The highest emissions per animal come, and will continue to come, from ruminants in mixed crop-livestock systems. (4) The regions producing the highest concentrations of methane, now and in the future, are in general terms, The Horn of Africa, West and East Africa. (5) The average emission factors obtained in this study (31.1 kg/methane (TLU year))) are in close agreement with the emission factors used by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for African ruminants (32 kg methane per animal per year). (6) The methodology employed in this study permits the disaggregation of methane emissions by country and production system, thus allows us to quantify changes in emissions as climate changes and production systems evolve. The results of the study are compared with those obtained in other studies around the world and its implications are discussed in relation to how systems are likely to evolve in Africa.

Both experiments comprising three cropping patterns (wheat intercropped with faba bean, monocropped wheat, and monocropped faba bean) and three N supply levels (deficient, adequate, and excessive) with three replicates in a randomized complete block design. Across two experiments, intercropping increased but N fertilization decreased flavonoids of wheat roots frequently. Intercropping variably increased secretion of naringenin from 0.5 to 1.9 folds (P < 0.5) in wheat roots at all three N levels, but rarely increased secretion of genistein and hesperetin in wheat at the deficient N level. Intercropped wheat secreted more flavonoids than monocropped wheat at its tillering (60(th)d) and flowering (95(th)d) stages; after the flowering stage, however, the differences between intercropping and monocropping were not significant at any N level. Secretion of flavonoids in wheat roots decreased with increased N supply. Interspecies and N supply altered the contents and proportions of flavonoids in wheat root exudations under wheat and faba bean intercropping.

J	"Carof, M; Godinot, O; Ridier, A"				"Carof, Matthieu; Godinot, Olivier; Ridier, Aude"			Diversity of protein-crop management in western France	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						"Protein crops; Faba bean; Field pea; Lupins; Crop management systems; Innovation; Farm survey"	"LEGUME; INTERCROPS; PRODUCTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; BENEFITS; SYSTEMS; EUROPE; YIELD; PEA"	In the European Union (EU), local production of protein crops (faba bean, field pea, lupins) is of primary interest to help farmers depend less on purchased feed, provide agronomic benefits to cropping systems, and increase the EU's protein self-sufficiency. Nonetheless, farmers rarely grow protein crops, which currently represent less than 1% of the EU's arable land. We assumed that exploration of farmers' practices will bring focus on (i) their motivations for growing protein crops, so that extension programs can be improved based on these motivations, and (ii) the diversity of their crop management so that promising ones can be disseminated. In western France, a two-step survey was conducted among farmers who grew protein crops. The first step was an online survey of 127 farmers that aimed to characterize their farming systems. The second step was a face-to-face survey (69 volunteers from the 127 farmers) that aimed to collect precise data on management of protein crops. The main motivations of surveyed farmers for growing protein crops were related to (i) replacing imported soybean with farm-grown protein crops and (ii) pre-crop values of protein crops (i.e., benefits of protein crops for subsequent crops). Based on conventional farmers' answers, we estimated a pre-crop value of 118 Euroha(-1), which notably contributes to gross profit at the crop-rotation scale. Moreover, in our study, yields of protein crops did not differ significantly between conventional and organic systems. This offers an interesting opportunity for conventional systems to integrate organic practices, such as complex intercropping, to reduce variable costs (costs of seeds, pesticides, regulators, and chemical fertilizers) and increase gross profits. This study shows for the first time that, in western France, pre-crop values of protein crops and their suitability for low-input systems are undervalued and could be emphasized more strongly to encourage their adoption.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term (up to nine years) impacts of nutrient management strategies and their local feasibility on crop productivity, soil fertility status and rainfall infiltration on two contrasting soil types and different prior management regimes in Murehwa, Zimbabwe. The nutrient management strategies employed in the study were: a control with no fertiliser, amendments of 100 kg N ha(-1), 100 kg N + lime, three rates of manure application (5,15 and 25 t ha(-1)) in combination with 100 kg N ha(-1), and three rates of P fertiliser (10, 30 and 50 kg P ha(-1)) in combination with 100 kg N, 20 kg Ca, 5 kg Zn and 10 kg Mn ha(-1). Maize grain yields in sandy soils did not respond to the sole application of 100 kg N ha(-1); manure application had immediate and incremental benefits on crop yields on the sandy soils. A combination of 25 t ha(-1) manure and 100 kg N gave the largest treatment yield of 9.3 t ha(-1) on the homefield clay soils, 6.1 t ha(-1) in the clay outfield, 7.6 t ha(-1) in the homefield and 3.4 t ha(-1) in the eighth season. Yields of the largest manure application on the sandy outfields were comparable to yields with 100 kg N in combination with 30 kg P. 20 kg Ca, 5 kg Zn and 10 kg Mn ha(-1) in the homefields suggesting the need to target nutrients differently to different fields. Manure application improved rainfall infiltration in the clay soils from 21 to 31 mm h(-1) but on the sandy soils the manure effect on infiltration was not significant. Despite the large manure applications, crop productivity and SOC build-up in the outfield sandy soils was small highlighting the difficulty to recover the fertility of degraded soils. The major cause of poor crop productivity on the degraded sandy soils despite the large additions of manure could not be ascertained. The current practice of allocating manure and fertiliser to fields closest to homesteads exacerbates land degradation in the sandy outfields and increases soil fertility gradients but results in the most harvest for the farm. On clay soils, manure may be targeted to outfields and mineral fertiliser to homefields to increase total crop productivity. Farmers who owned cattle in the study site can achieve high manure application rates on small plots, and manure application can be rotated according to crop sequences. Consistent application of manure in combination with mineral fertilisers can be an effective option to improve crop yield. SOC and moisture conservation under smallholder farming conditions. Combined manure and mineral fertiliser application can be adapted locally as a feasible entry point for ecological intensification in mixed crop-livestock systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this context, cereal-legume intercropping is a practice that can achieve increased yield under low-input conditions through the complementary use of abiotic resources and facilitation mechanisms. Many management options exist to design cereal-legume intercropping systems, among which the choice of the species intercropped and the level of nitrogen (N) fertilization are essential. In this study, we collected the results of 35 field experiments across Europe of cereal-grain legume intercrops that combined various intercropped species and N fertilization levels. We first assessed the intensity of the biodiversity effect and its components in unfertilized intercrops. Then, we focused on a subset of systems to analyze how N fertilization influenced biodiversity effects on three intercrops (durum wheat/pea, soft wheat/pea, and durum wheat/faba bean). The biodiversity effect represents the gap between the observed and expected yields of a mixture. The complementarity effect is the performance of mixtures relative to the performance of the component monocultures. The selection effect captures the extent to which a species with a high monoculture yield dominates a mixture at the expense of the other intercropped species. Our results confirmed an overall positive biodiversity effect under unfertilized conditions and various climate conditions (0.86 +/- 0.04 t.ha(-1)). Complementarity effect was the main driver as it represented 76% of the biodiversity effect, confirming intercropping as a useful practice in low-input systems. N fertilization lowered the complementarity effect in durum wheat/pea intercrops, did not influence these effects in soft wheat/pea intercrops, and increased only the selection effect in durum wheat/faba bean intercrops. These results highlight the need for a sufficiently competitive legume in intercrops when N fertilizers are applied in order to avoid too much disruption of plant-plant interactions.

Over forty species of fe,od grains are grown in traditional agroecosystems of Central Himalaya, which have been managed by the local farming communities since lime immemorial. These traditional crop varieties hare evolved over centuries and are well adapted to the particular area. A number of edaphic, topographic and climatic factors associated with different selection pressures over centuries of cultivation resulted in immense variations in the crop species. The grain and by-product yield of the majority of the traditional crops cultivated across an altitudinal gradient wvere worked out and compared with common food crops (paddy, wheat, mustard) at two points in time (1970-74, 1990-94) and it was found that almost all the traditional crops had slightly higher yields during 1970-74 than between 1990-94, However, common food crops grown during the Kharif season had higher yields during 1990-94 whereas, Rabi season crops exhibited higher yield during 1970-74. The yield of rainfed paddy remained static over the years across the altitudinal gradient. Among the traditional crops cultivated during the Kharif and Rabi seasons in mixed and pure forms at different altitudes were Macrotyloma uniformum (at higher altitude), Parilla frutescens and Vigna mungo (at middle altitude) and Panicum miliaceum (at lower altitude) which were found to be eco-energetically efficient. Avena sativa (oat) and mixed cropping of Fagopyrum esculentum and potato had higher energy efficiency ratios whereas the latter also exhibited a higher monetary output/input ratio. Crops like paddy and wheat with mustard, grown in irrigated land were found to be more ecoenergetically efficient than the same crops grown in the rainfed land. In general, traditional crops possess higher nutritive value than the common food crops. The contribution of traditional crops to the local diet (kg/capita/year) and their energy and protein equivalents were higher during both time periods, It was observed that while exporting these traditional crops, the locals of the region are highly exploited by middlemen. Despite having huge potential, traditional crop diversity of this region has been reduced to a great extent during the last two decades. Besides, the area under cultivation with these crops has been declining rapidly. However, many of these crops possess immense potential to meet the growing food demand and ensure food security of an increasing population. Therefore, a comprehensive programme of conservation through various means and improvement of agronomic yield in their natural habitats is urgently needed.

Impacts of soil damage by grazing livestock on crop productivity	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH			English	Article						"Crop-livestock; Soil compaction; Infiltration; Simulation; Grain yield; Roots"	"RED DUPLEX SOIL; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; FARMING SYSTEMS; YIELD RESPONSE; NEW-ZEALAND; COMPACTION; INFILTRATION; CATTLE; MODEL; CULTIVATION"	"Soil damage by livestock on cropped land is a concern for mixed crop-livestock producers. The hypothesis that livestock-induced soil damage does not effect subsequent crop productivity was investigated in three ways; a review of existing literature; two experimental studies in southern Australia; and based on these, use of a farming system model to simulate likely consequences of changes to soil conditions on crop productivity under a variety of seasonal conditions. The literature suggests that treading by livestock increases soil strength and bulk density and reduces macro-porosity and infiltration rate. Yet, the effects are confined to the soil surface (0-0.1 m) and are short-lived due to amelioration through natural processes or tillage. Despite the potential for soil damage, few studies report yield penalties in following crops, possibly because effects are too small in magnitude or depth to influence plant growth significantly, or because of the highly season-dependent nature of crop response. Two recent field experiments in southern Australia also found no effect of sheep grazing on subsequent crop grow :h or yield, despite evidence of surface compaction and reduced infiltration rate. Using reviewed literature and this experimental evidence, we adjusted soil parameters in APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator) to reflect mild, moderate and severe reductions in surface root growth and surface water infiltration. The predicted sensitivity of wheat crop productivity to these simulated impacts was investigated at 6 locations in eastern Australia. Consistent with experimental evidence, predicted average grain yield was reduced by <10% (+3 to -10%) under mild and moderate scenarios typical of those reported experimentally. Crop yields were reduced by lower rainfall infiltration and fallow efficiency in locations with summer-dominant-rainfall, and by reduced root exploration at locations with winter-dominant-rainfall. Lower residue cover levels amplified reductions in rainfall infiltration, especially reducing the accumulation of soil water during summer fallow. Predicted grain yield was only reduced substantially (up to 43% on average) when severe changes in soil parameters were implemented (e.g 90% reduction in rate of root exploration in surface layers). Overall, most experiments support our hypothesis that grazing livestock have little effect on subsequent crop yields. Long-term simulations suggest that soil impacts generating large reductions in root growth and infiltration rate are required to reduce subsequent crop yields substantially. Such impacts are unlikely where current best-practice grazing management occurs, but would be possible on structurally degraded soils where surface cover is allowed to fall below critical levels.

The effects of production systems integrating grain production with winter annual and perennial pastures under no-tillage were assessed. Four production systems were evaluated: system I (wheat/soybean, white oat/soybean, and common vetch/corn); system If (wheat/soybean, white oat/soybean, and grazed black oat + grazed common vetch/corn); system III/perennial cool season pastures (fescue + white clover + red clover + birdsfoot trefoil)]; and system I-V [perennial warm season pastures (bahiagrass + black oat + rye grass + white clover + red clover + birds/bot trefoil)]; and system V (alfalfa as hay crop), which was established in an adjacent area in 1994. The areas under systems III, IV, and V returned to system I after the summer of 1996. The treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design, with four replications. Exchangeable Al and Ca + Mg, organic matter, extractable P, and exchangeable K levels were influenced by crop production systems. The production systems increased the contents of organic matter, extractable P, and exchangeable K, mainly at 0-5 cm depth. Organic matter, exchangeable Al, extractable P, and exchangeable K levels decreased from the 0-5 cm layer to the 15-20 cm layer, while the opposite occurred with pH and exchangeable Ca + Mg contents."

The effect of dual legume intercropping on grain yield of normal-leafed pea was studied during 2015 and 2016 in order to reduce lodging, to improve grain yield stability and to analyse the competitiveness of field pea with annual legumes and wheat. The research involved six species grown as sole crops: normal-leafed pea (Pisum sativum L. (Partim)), semi-leafless pea (Pisum sativum L. (Partim), faba bean (Vicia faba L. (Partim)), white lupin (Lupinus albus L.), fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) and wheat as a control (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori et Paol) and intercrop mixtures of normal-leafed pea with other five species. Grain yield (t ha(-1)), yield components, land equivalent ratio, relative crowding coefficient and aggressivity value for grain yield were monitored. The highest grain yield of normal-leafed pea (2.87 t ha(-1)) was obtained from the mixture with semi-leafless pea in 2015 and from the mixture of wheat + normal-leafed pea (5.26 t ha(-1)) in 2016. The lowest number of pods and seeds per plant was formed by normal-leafed pea as a sole crop in 2015 (5.2 and 19.2, respectively). The obtained results showed that a thousand seed weight differed between treatments; however, the differences were not significant. The highest land equivalent ratio (1.40), relative crowding coefficient (4.44) and the positive value of aggressivity (0.19) were observed in the mixture of fenugreek + normal-leafed pea. The results demonstrated that semi-leafless + normal-leafed pea and fenugreek + normal-leafed pea are the most beneficial mixtures for grain production, while faba bean was a less suitable component for intercropping with normal-leafed pea."

Integrated soil and water conservation is widely applied as a means to reverse the trend and increase productivity. This study investigated the effects of such integrated approaches at two sites, Jeldu and Diga, in Western Ethiopia. A split plot design with physical soil and water conservation in the main plots and agronomic practices in the sub plots was employed. Maize (Zea mays L.) followed by groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) at Diga, and wheat (Triticum aestivum) followed by faba bean (Vicia faba L.) were the test crops. Surface soils were sampled before sowing and after the crop harvest, and analyzed for selected parameters. Soil moisture content during the growing period was also monitored. The use of soil bund increased soil moisture content, and significantly (P < 0.05) increased days to flowering and maturity, kernel weight and harvest index, grain yield of the test crops, with the exception of maize. The improved agronomic practices (intercropping, fertilization and row planting) significantly (P < 0.05) increased grain yield of all the test crops. The effect of the treatments on soil parameters may require longer time to be evident. Although the increase in crop yield due to soil bund and the improved agronomic practices is eminent, economic analysis is necessary before recommending the widespread use of the improved options.

Cereal-legume mixtures can lead to more efficient uptake of growth-limiting resources, and increase and stabilize yields, due to the variation in functional traits that facilitate partitioning of niche space. Here we identify crop mixtures with functional traits that facilitate optimal N resource use in two selected cereal-legume mixtures by using the multi-dimensional trait space concept. Combinations of pea-barley and faba bean-wheat crops were grown in the field as pure cultures and mixtures in Central Sweden, during two years with contrasting weather. The ecological niche space was defined via the n-dimensional hypervolumes represented by N pool, tiller/branch number, shoot biomass, and grain yield functional traits. Regressions and correlations allowed quantifying the relations between functional traits and plant N pools. Differences in trait space were not a result of crop mixing per se, as similar hypervolumes were found in the pure culture and mixture-grown crops. Instead, the trait space differences depended on the cultivar identities admixed. Furthermore, cereals increased their efficiency for N uptake and therefore benefitted more than the legumes in the mixtures, in terms of accumulated N and grain yields. Tiller and shoot biomass production in cereals was positively correlated to N pool accumulation during the season. Resource acquisition through increased N uptake in the mixture was associated with a reduced overlap in niche-space in the mixtures, and initial seed N pools significantly contributed to within-season N accumulation, shoot and tiller production.

However, relatively few studies have directly measured resource acquisition to assess potential mechanisms underlying enhanced performance of intercropping. A long-term field experiment with three P application rates (0, 40, 80 kg P ha(-1) yr.(-1)) and four maize-based intercropping systems was used to assess P acquisition and P fertilizer recovery efficiency (PRE) for three consecutive years. To identify underlying mechanisms, the additive partitioning method was applied to determine complementarity (CE) and selection effects (SE) in P acquisition of intercropping. Average P acquisition increased by 28.4% and 27.6% compared to their monocultures in faba bean/maize and chickpea/maize intercropping, respectively. However, P acquisition was generally not enhanced and even reduced in the last year in soybean/maize and oilseed rape/maize intercropping. Enhanced P acquisition was due to positive CE in faba bean/maize, and to positive CE and SE in chickpea/maize intercropping. Increased resource acquisition via CE and/or SE depended on the particular crop combination in intercropping systems. Application of the additive partitioning method to intercropping may help to identify underlying mechanisms of overyielding and carefully select crop combinations to enable more efficient resource use.

No-Till Farming and Conservation Agriculture in South Asia - Issues, Challenges, Prospects and Benefits	CRITICAL REVIEWS IN PLANT SCIENCES			English	Review						"Carbon sequestration; conservation agriculture; crop productivity and profitability; crop residue retention; no-till farming; soil biodiversity ecosystem services; soil erosion; soil health; weed management"	"INDO-GANGETIC PLAINS; SOIL ORGANIC-CARBON; WHEAT CROPPING SYSTEM; AGGREGATE-ASSOCIATED CARBON; WEED MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES; CLAY LOAM SOIL; MAIZE ZEA-MAYS; RESIDUE-MANAGEMENT; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES"	Of late, intensive farming for higher food production is often associated with many negative implications for soil systems, such as decline of soil organic matter (SOM), increase in risks of soil erosion by wind and/or water, decline in soil biological diversity, increase in degradation of soil physical quality, lower nutrient-use efficiency, high risks of groundwater pollution, falling water tables, increasing salinization and waterlogging, in-field burning of crop residues, pollution of air and emission of greenhouse gases (GHG), leading to global warming, and decline in factor productivity. These negative implications necessitate an objective review of strategies to develop sustainable management practices, which could not only sustain soil health and ensure food security, but also enhance carbon sequestration, decrease GHG emissions, and offer clean and better ecosystem services. Conservation agriculture (CA), that includes reduced or no-till practices along with crop residue retention and mixed crop rotations, offers multiple benefits. Adoption of a system-based CA conserves water, improves and creates more efficient use of natural resources through the integrated management of available soil nutrients, water, and biological resources, and enhances use efficiency of external inputs. Due to apparent benefits of CA, it is increasingly being adopted and now covers about 180 million hectares (Mha) worldwide. However, in South Asia its spread is low (<5 Mha), mostly concentrated in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP). In this region, one of the serious issues is residue burning with severe environmental impacts. A huge amount of crop residue left over after the combine harvest of rice has forced farmers to practice widespread residue burning (similar to 140 M tonnes) to cope with excessive stubble and also for timely planting/sowing of succeeding crops. In rice-wheat cropping systems, which cover more than 10 Mha in the IGP, CA practices are relatively more accepted by farmers. In these systems, any delay in sowing leads to yield penalty of 1-1.5% per day after the optimum sowing date of wheat. The strong adoption of CA practices in IGP is mainly to overcome delayed sowing due to the field preparation and control of weeds, timely planting, and also escape from terminal heat during the grain-filling stage. Major challenges to CA adoption in South Asia are small land holdings (<1 ha), low technological reach to farmers, nonavailability of suitable farm implements for small farm holders, and the staunch conventional farming mind-set. South Asia region consists of many countries of diverse agro-ecologies with contrasting farming systems and management. This region, recently known for rapid economic growth and increasing population, necessitates higher food production and also hot-spots for adoption of CA technologies. Therefore, in this review critically explores the possibility, extent of area, prospects, challenges, and benefits of CA in South Asia.	"[Somasundaram, J.; Sinha, N. K.; Mohanty, M.; Hati, K.

J	"Lacoste, M; Lawes, R; Ducourtieux, O; Flower, K"				"Lacoste, Myrtille; Lawes, Roger; Ducourtieux, Olivier; Flower, Ken"			Comparative agriculture methods capture distinct production practices across a broadacre Australian landscape	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"Soil heterogeneity; Land use; Rotation; Sequence; Farmer; Mixed methods"	"WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; FARMING SYSTEMS; CROP SEQUENCES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DECISION-MAKING; WHEAT YIELD; BREAK CROPS; AGROECOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; SALINITY"	In farming systems research the link between farm resources, management and performances is often described, but rarely confirmed or quantified. Problems arise in formalising such linkages because substantial spatial and longitudinal whole-farm data are difficult to acquire. This study used the integrative discipline of comparative agriculture to collect such information and address a wide range of related farming system questions. The mixed method procedure included a landscape analysis, a historical investigation, and the collection of current farm information from 36 farms, representing half the farming businesses of a 4 000 km(2) area in a region of the Western Australian wheatbelt (similar to 300 mm/year) with highly variable soils. Land types influenced management, including cropping specialisation, and explained some of the regional variability in grain yield and enterprise mix. Rotations varied by soil type and farm type. On average their duration was 3-4 years, typically starting with a 2-3 years of wheat, resulting in overall composition of 64% cereals, 20% break crops and 16% pastures/fallows. Break crops were grown more on light sandy soils than on heavier fine-textured soils. Lights soils were managed similarly by all farmers but distinctions occurred on heavier soils between mixed crop-livestock farmers and cropping specialists. This divergence in farming production was explained by farm soil composition: whilst cropping appears more profitable in the region, mixed farmers retained animals and pastures as a strategy to cope with having greater proportions of land less suited to crop production. Typical farm grain yields were indeed found to vary in relation to farm soil composition. The location of the original family farm in the landscape is likely to explain these differences in farm land resources, and subsequently current farm performance, production strategies and trajectories. This study highlighted the potential of a method that deserves wider application: comparative agriculture helped identify and establish complex relationships within the farming system, some of which challenge common assumptions. Further applications to define typical farms, monitor practices, and contribute meaningful divisions of agricultural landscapes are also discussed. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Experiment was conducted under split plot arrangement having 3 main plots (Sole Rye, Rye with hairy vetch and rye with pea) and 4 sub-plots (0, 50, 100 and 150 kg N/ha). Findings showed if rye was mixed cropped with hairy vetch, dry matter (DM) and total digestible nutrient (TDN) yield was not different (P>0.05) from control, whereas rye-vetch mixture had increased (P<0.05) crude protein (CP) yield and carrying capacity for Hanwoo heifers than that of rye monoculture. DM and TDN yield under 100 kg manure was higher (P<0.05) than control and 50 kg N/ha levels but not different (P>0.05) with that of 150 kg N/ha. Manure levels did not affect (P>0.05) protein yield. The carrying capacity for Hanwoo heifers was not different among zero, 50 and 100 kg manure levels, whereas it was higher at 150 kg N/ha (P<0.05) than all other manure levels. Similarly, results depicted little different pattern when rye was mixed sown with pea that DM and TDN yield was not different (P>0.05) when compared with rye monoculture, whereas CP yield was higher in mixed forage than control but carrying capacity was higher (P<0.05) at all manure levels except 150 kg N/ha. It was concluded from findings of present study that mixed growing strategy of rye with local hairy vetch didn't need any manure application for optimum crude protein yield, whereas 100 kg N/ha manure would be adequate for overall optimum forage yield and 150 kg N/ha needed for obtaining optimum carrying capacity for Hanwoo heifers. Similarly, Rye pea mixed culture didn't need manure application for optimum crude protein yield but 50 kg N/ha manure would be needful for adequate dry matter yield and carrying capacity for Hanwoo heifers. However, 100 kg N/ha manure could be sufficient for optimal yield of digestible nutrients.

Six cropping treatments were examined in a greenhouse experiment: peanut grown separately in monoculture, normal peanut/maize intercropping (two genotypes: Danyu13, Zhongdan12), peanut/barley intercropping, peanut/oats intercropping, and peanut/wheat intercropping. Additionally, we investigated in a field experiment the same five cropping systems as the greenhouse experiment (maize/peanut intercropping not including Zhongdan12). Our results show that the chlorophyll and active Fe concentrations in the young leaves of the peanut in the intercropping system with different gramineous species were much higher than those of the peanut in monoculture. In greenhouse conditions, the Fe concentration in the shoots of peanut plants grown in the intercropping systems of two maize genotypes separately were 1.40-1.44, 1.47-1.64 and 1.15-1.42 times higher respectively than those of peanut plants grown in monocropping at 55, 60 and 70 days. In particular, the Fe concentration in shoots of peanut plants grown in the intercropping systems of barley, oats and wheat were not only higher than those in monocropping but also higher than those in peanut intercropped cropping with maize. In the field, the concentration of Fe in shoot of intercropped peanut plants in rows 1-3 from gramineous species were significantly higher than in monocropping at the flowering stage. Simultaneously with iron nutrition variation in peanut, Zn and Cu concentrations of intercropped grown peanut increased significantly compared to those in monocropping in the greenhouse experiment, and different intercropping treatments generally increased the Zn and Cu content in the shoot of peanut in the field. Systemic mechanisms may be involved in adaptation to nutrient stresses at the whole plant level. The study suggests that a reasonable intercropping system of nutrient efficient species should be considered to prevent or mitigate iron and zinc deficiency of plants in agricultural practice.

Diversity, extent and importance for nutritional security in the Western Highlands of Guatemala	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article								We present an assessment of the extent, diversity, and nutritional contribution of the milpa through a quantitative analysis of data from a survey conducted in 989 small scale farm households in the Western Highlands of Guatemala (WHG). The milpa is a traditional agricultural system in which maize is intercropped with other species, such as common beans, faba beans, squashes or potatoes. Our study shows that more than two-thirds of the 1,205 plots recorded were under the milpa system, with a great diversity of crop combinations. As shown with the 357 plots for which specific yields were available, milpa systems present higher total productivity than monocropped maize, expressed as total energy yield of the harvested crops in the respective system, and were also better at providing the recommended daily allowances of fourteen essential nutrients, based on a Potential Nutrient Adequacy (PNA) indicator. Maize-bean-potato, maize-potato, and maize-bean-faba intercrops had the highest PNAs, and monocropped maize, the lowest. These results support the implementation of milpa systems tailored to different agro-ecologies in order to improve nutrition in the WHG and a variety of similar regions.

J	"Menke, CA; Rauber, R"				"Menke, Christian Antonius; Rauber, Rolf"			Evaluation of winter cover crops preceding maize for biogas utilization	BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT			German	Article							"NITROGEN CATCH CROPS; ROOT-GROWTH; SUGAR-BEET; ACCUMULATION"	In the wake of the greening requirements that are part of the new legal framework of the European Commission, the cultivation of cover crops, including winter cover crops, will gain importance. An approach is submitted to evaluate winter cover crops. From the manifold economic and ecological services of winter cover crops, three parameters are selected and evaluated: (1) nitrogen conservation during the winter, (2) methane production, and (3) preceding crop effects on maize. The evaluation is carried out using simple sub-indices mathematically designed in such a way that they are greater the better the performance of the winter cover crop is. Finally, the three sub-indices are added together to obtain the Index of relative cultivation advantage (IrA). 33 winter cover crop variants were grown in two-year field trials and the sub-indices calculated. The most favorable IrA values attained mixed stands like the Landsberger Gemenge (hairy vetch + Italian ryegrass + crimson clover) and Wickroggen (rye + hairy vetch). Winter cereals performed comparatively poorly. Based on the IrA, the large-grained legumes, winter faba beans and winter peas, had the lowest cultivation potential. IrA can be used for a weak point analysis. Thus, for the winter faba beans, a novel cropping system was already presented which is able to compensate for this field crop's biggest disadvantage, namely its poor nitrogen uptake during the winter months. The sub-indices can be weighted and thus adapted to specific local conditions. Expansion options for IrA could be for example sub-indices for ensilability, water requirement and root growth (humus effect). Furthermore, socioeconomically-oriented sub-indices are conceivable. An individual sub-index now results from the deviation of a specific performance of a winter cover crop from the mean performance of all tested winter cover crops. It seems possible to use fixed target values instead of the mean performance of all tested winter cover crops.

J	"Ruhlemann, L; Schmidtke, K"				"Ruehlemann, Lars; Schmidtke, Knut"			Evaluation of monocropped and intercropped grain legumes for cover cropping in no-tillage and reduced tillage organic agriculture	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"Organic no-till; Cover crop; Nitrogen fixation; Intercropping; Organic farming; Weed suppression"	"PISUM-SATIVUM L.; GREEN-MANURE; NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION; WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; WEED COMPETITION; SOIL PROPERTIES; CROPS; SYSTEMS; GROWTH; PEA"	Intensive tillage by means of mouldboard ploughing can be highly effective for weed control in organic farming, but it also carries an elevated risk for rapid humus decomposition and soil erosion. To develop organic systems that are less dependent on tillage, a two-year study at Reinhardtsgrimma and Kollitsch, Germany was conducted to determine whether certain legume cover crops could be equally successfully grown in a no-till compared with a reduced tillage system. The summer annual legumes faba bean (Vicia faba L), normal leafed field pea (Pisum sativum L), narrow-leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L), grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L), and common vetch (Vicia sativa L) were examined with and without sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) as a companion crop for biomass and nitrogen accumulation, symbiotic nitrogen fixation (N-2 fixation) and weed suppression. Total cover crop biomass, shoot N accumulation and N-2 fixation differed with year, location, tillage system and species due to variations in weather, inorganic soil N resources and weed competition. Biomass production reached up to 1.65 and 2.19 Mg ha(-1) (both intercropped field peas), and N-2 fixation up to 53.7 and 60.5 kg ha(-1) (both common vetches) in the no-till and reduced tillage system, respectively. In the no-till system consistently low sunflower performance compared with the legumes prevented significant intercropping effects. Under central European conditions no-till cover cropping appears to be practicable if weed density is low at seeding. The interactions between year, location, tillage system and species demonstrate the difficulties in cover crop species selection for organic conservation tillage systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The profitability of harvesting grass silages at early maturity stages: An analysis of dairy farming systems in Norway	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						"Grassland; Harvesting strategy; Forage cost; Milk production; Digestibility; Linear programming"	"MILK-PRODUCTION; LEVEL; COWS; SIMULATION; RESPONSES; FORAGES"	Feeding forages produced by early and frequent harvests may improve animal performance. This paper evaluates how harvesting regimes (HRs) in grass silage production influence optimal use of inputs and profitability in two types of Norwegian dairy farming systems: a mountain grassland farm and a lowland mixed crop-livestock farm. A whole-farm linear programming model was developed to compare three HRs within each farm type. HR1 and HR2 were three-cut systems harvested at very early (HR1) or early (HR2) crop maturity stages producing highly digestible forages. HR3 was a two-cut system returning higher dry matter yields of medium digestibility. Input-output response relations incorporated into the model were derived from field trials (N-fertilisation x HR), conducted at two representative locations for the two farm types, and from dairy cow and finishing bull feeding experiments at various levels of concentrate feeding to supplement silage from each HR. The model maximised total gross margin of farms with 150,0001 milk quota, and housing capacity for 25 cows. Farmland availability varied from 10 to 30 ha with 20 ha as the basis. The results indicated that farmland availability profoundly influences the input intensity and the profitability of producing and feeding silages harvested at early maturity stages. At restricted land availabilities in the mountain, the three-cut silages were obtained at too high costs in terms of lower grass yield, increased harvesting costs, and costs of shorter ley life. Silage DM consumption per head also increased with increasing digestibility. Under HR1 and HR2 it was impossible to fully produce the quota with 20 ha farmland and overall mountain farm profitability was depressed. With more land available, sufficient quantities of three-cut silages were produced to take advantage of the enhanced animal performances. Within all HRs, grass yields were highest in the lowland. The profitability of HR3 in the lowland was limited to smaller land areas, and, generally, producing highly digestible silages of HR1 was more profitable than devoting more land to barley. For both farm types, inputs of fertilisers and concentrates declined as more land became available, but at lower land areas for HR3. Removal of the milk quota constraint resulted in higher milk yields per cow, and strengthened profitability of HR3 endured into larger farmland areas than with a quota. With abundant land available, however, the three-cut silages were relatively more profitable without rather than with a restricting quota, and HR1 outperformed HR2. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Grain and biomass productivity was determined for four variants (i) sole maize (sole-maize), (ii) sole lablab (sole-lablab), (iii) maize/lablab with both crops sown simultaneously (intercropped-SP) and (iv) maize/lablab with lablab sown 28 days after the maize crop (intercropped-DP). Soil water and weather data were monitored and evaluated. The trial was conducted for two seasons (2015/2016 and 2016/2017) at two sites in the Limpopo Province, South Africa: Univen (847 mm rainfall, 29.2 degrees C maximum and 18.9 degrees C minimum temperature average for the cropping season over the years 2008-2017) and Syferkuil (491 mm rainfall, with 27.0 degrees C maximum and 14.8 degrees C minimum temperature). Analysis revealed three key results: The treatment with intercropped-SP had significantly lower maize yields (2320 kg ha(-1)) compared with maize in intercropped-DP (2865 kg ha(-1)) or sole-maize (2623 kg ha(-1)). As expected, maize yields in the El Nino affected in season 2015/2016 were on average 1688 kg ha(-1)lower than in 2016/2017. Maize yields were significantly lower (957 kg ha(-1)) at Univen, the warmer site with higher rainfall, than at Syferkuil. In 2015/2016, maximum temperature at Univen exceeded 40 degrees C around anthesis. Furthermore, soil water was close to the estimated permanent wilting point (PWP) for most of the cropping season, which indicates possible water limitations. In Syferkuil, the soil water was maintained well above PWP. Lablab yields were low, around 500 ha(-1), but stable as they were not affected by treatment across season and site. Overall, the study demonstrated that intercropped-DP appears to use available soil water more efficiently than sole maize. Intercropped-DP could therefore be considered as an option for sustainable intensification under high climate risk and resource-limited conditions for smallholders in southern Africa.

Maize for food and feed in East Africa-The farmers' perspective	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Maize; Mixed cropping system; Dual-purpose; Participatory evaluation"	"CROP-LIVESTOCK SYSTEMS; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; FARMING SYSTEMS; VARIETY ATTRIBUTES; ADOPTION; AGRICULTURE; PERCEPTIONS; IMPROVEMENT; PROGRESS; MODELS"	The rapid increase of both human and livestock populations, along with a restricted land base and an increased demand for livestock products, put high pressure on the maize-livestock systems that dominate East and Southern Africa. Dual-purpose maize, i.e. varieties with increased grain and stover yields, are therefore being developed. These varieties show high potential, but it is not clear if they respond to a demand by targeted farmers. Therefore the farmers' perspective on such varieties was studied in selected districts in Ethiopia (three districts) and Tanzania (two districts), using both informal methods (participatory rural appraisals) and formal methods (farmer evaluation of varieties and household surveys), the latter involving 360 households in Ethiopia and 150 households in Tanzania. Results show that maize stover is an important element of livestock feed in the study areas. Farmers mention a wide variety of criteria they use to evaluate maize varieties. These include field characteristics such as yield and pest resistance, consumer characteristics such as cooking and taste qualities, and feed characteristics including stover quality and quantity. Analysis of adoption patterns shows that varieties that score well on feed characteristics have a higher probability of being adopted. We conclude that there is a demand for varieties with increased stover quantity and quality, as long as they do not compromise field characteristics, in particular yield, and consumer qualities. Such varieties would have the potential to increase the productivity of maize-livestock systems and the income of these farmers, while reducing the pressure on the environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Maize (Zea mays) and cowpea (Vigna sinensis) monocultures as well as their mixture in three planting patterns (M-1: alternate-row intercrop, M-2: within-row intercrop, M-3: mixed intercrop) were used to investigate on forage yield as well as the effect of intercropping on maize forage quality. The experiment was carried out as randomized complete block design with three replications. The results showed that intercropping systems had a significant effect on forage dry weight, where dry matter yield was increased by intercropping as compared with maize and cowpea sole crops. It was related with a higher consumption consumption of environmental resources, such as photosynthetically active radiation and soil moisture, by intercropping. Maize forage quality in terms of crude protein was improved by intercropping. It was because of more nitrogen availability for maize in intercropping compared with its sole crop.

The soil P mobilisation potential was assessed by incubating low P soil for up to 30 days with poorly available P sources; C and N were added to increase microbial activity and ensure that only P was limiting microbial growth. The increase in microbial P from day 0 to day 15 showed that microbes were able to mobilise P from FePO4 and phytate. The P mobilisation potential (sum of microbial and resin P) of the rhizosphere soil decreased in the following order: faba bean > chickpea and white lupin > wheat. After 10 days, up to 80% of the mobilised P was microbial P, whereas after 30 days, almost all P mobilised was resin P.

Mixtures of winter-rye/winter-wheat (food grains) and spring-barley/oats (feeding grains) were tested for their ability to reduce fungal leaf damage. Significant and regular reductions in disease frequency and intensity were achieved. This was especially true for Erysiphe graminis f.sp. hordei and Puccinia recondita f.sp. tritici, but also included leaf spot diseases caused by Drechslera avenae and Rhynchosporium secalis. Compared with fungicide applications, mixtures of two species showed adequate effects in reducing disease intensity. Harvesting of mixtures never presented a problem. This was especially due to a conspicuous.maturity adjustment. Species mixtures of cereals therefore deserve more attention in environmentally safe cropping systems.

Ground beetle abundance and species richness were higher in plots operated under an organic farming regime than in those under a chemical regime, but neither crop type [barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), faba bean (Vicia faba L.), barley-pea (Pisum sativum L.) intercrop] nor crop rotation had an effect. Reduced tillage did not significantly change overall carabid activity or species richness but species differed in their response to tillage treatments. The carabid assemblage from an uncultivated field differed conspicuously from assemblages in the crops and fescue. Carabid abundance was highest in the meadow and the fauna was dominated by the exotic species Pterostichus melanarius Illiger. Effects of agronomic practice on carabid assemblages are complex, reflecting the interaction of biological traits of particular species and the combination of agronomic treatments applied.

The increase was in the order of 42 to 194%. The 1:1 system also produced maximum grain yield among different intercropping systems. Better performance of 1:1 system was attributed to creation of more border rows that resulted in the least influence by shorter component crop through the formation of a two tier system.

We investigate the influence of agricultural management practices on nutrient stocks and soil functions during the conversion of former extensively used grassland to arable land. Effects of grassland removal, tillage, intercropping with faba bean (Vicia faba) and its later incorporation were studied with respect to soil properties and bacterial community structure. Therefore, composite samples were collected with a core sampler from the topsoil (0-20 cm) in (a) the initial grassland, (b) the transitional phase during the vegetation period of V. faba, (c) after ploughing the legume in, and (d) untreated controls. In all samples, nitrate-N, ammonium-N, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total nitrogen bound (TNb) were analyzed and comparisons of the bacterial community structure after 16S-amplicon sequencing were performed to assess soil functions. Mineralization after grassland conversion followed by the biological nitrogen fixation of broad beans enhanced the nitrate-N content in bulk soil from 4 to almost 50 mu g N g(-1) dw. Bacterial community structure on phylum level in bulk soil was dominated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Bacteroidetes and remained almost stable. However, alpha and beta-diversity analysis revealed a change of the bacterial composition at the final state of the conversion. This change was primarily driven by increasing abundances of the genera Massilia and Lysobacter, both members of the Proteobacteria, after the decay of the leguminous plant residues. Furthermore, increasing abundances of the family Gaiellaceae and its genus Gaiella fostered this change and were related to the decreasing carbon to nitrogen ratio. In short, gentle management strategies could replace the input of mineral fertilizer with the aim to contribute to future sustainable and intensified production even on converted grassland.

Metzg.] is an oilseed crucifer mainly grown in Nordic and Baltic countries. It can be undersown in a spring cereal as an alternative to sowing of pure stand in late July. Establishment by undersowing helps to utilize the short growing season at high latitudes. However, as undersown crops tend to affect the growth and yield of their companion crops, the effect of undersown winter turnip rape on cereal yield and quality needs to be assessed. Additionally, an evaluation of the suitability of different cereals as companion crops to winter turnip rape is required before practical recommendations can be made. The suitability of four spring cereals as companion crops to winter turnip rape was studied in three field experiments. Two-row barley, six-row barley, wheat and oat were sown at two different densities, with and without undersown winter turnip rape, sowing density depending on the density of the cereal. Undersowing winter turnip rape in a cereal did not markedly affect cereal yield. In some years six-row barley and oat with undersown winter turnip rape produced more yield than corresponding pure stands, indicating a possible facilitative effect of the undersown crucifer on the two cereal species. The results suggest that the most compatible cereals as companion crops with undersown winter turnip rape are six-row barley and oat. Mixed stand cultivation could be improved trough the identification of the optimal cereal-winter turnip rape combinations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

At the same time, large areas of land will be required to feed a growing global population. Intercropping has been proposed as a potential solution to maximize both biodiversity and yield at large scale, but experimental evidence is scarce. In a three-year field experiment, we manipulated crop diversity and management intensity in a cereal-legume intercropping experiment in Germany, where 50% of wheat was replaced by faba beans. We measured arthropod abundance and diversity of different functional groups (pollinators, natural enemies, herbivores) and crop yield. We found that increasing crop diversity increased abundance and diversity of arthropods. Notably, pollinator and natural enemy abundances increased in intercropped systems. Low management intensity generally had positive effects on arthropod abundance and especially on pollinator diversity, indicating benefits of reduced inputs of fertilizers and herbicides. While wheat yield was higher in monocultures and for high management intensity, total grain yield of the intercrop (indicated by land equivalent ratio) was higher in mixtures. We found that trade-offs were stronger between arthropod diversity and wheat yield than between arthropod abundance and wheat yield. Specialist wheat herbivores and generalist herbivores were more abundant at higher wheat yields. Conversely, pollinator and natural enemy diversity were negatively associated with wheat yield. Our results show that diversification can promote both higher yields and greater diversity of arthropods. Intercropping can thus be an opportunity to support biodiversity without risking significant yield losses. (C) 2021 The Authors.

Retaining crop residues in the field is not only a prerequisite for CA but may also be the most viable option for African farmers to retain their fields in a productive state. In this paper, (1) we explore the possibility of increasing the quantity of crop residue available by closing the maize yield, (2) we propose interventions that can reduce crop residue demand for livestock feed, and (3) we quantify the optimum amount of crop residues required as mulch, using empirical, secondary and modeling data from Western Kenya and the Ethiopian Rift Valley. Residue retention can also be increased by reducing livestock demand. Closing the maize yield gap-i.e. achieve 90% of the water-limited yield potential-and intensifying dairy production-which would promote the use of rations that are more energy-dense than cereal residue-based rations-would increase the estimated proportion of farmers retaining at least 1 t ha(-1) of crop residues from the current 36% to 97% in Western Kenya. In the Ethiopian Rift Valley, closing the maize yield gap and substituting mechanization to animal draught power would increase the estimated proportion of farmers retaining at least 1 t ha(-1) of crop residues from the current 3% to 83%. We conclude that the question is not 'if', but 'how' cereal residues can fulfill the demand of both the soil and the livestock. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The objectives of this paper are to share approaches on how Africa RISING project enabled smallholder farmers to intensify feed and forage resources; present research findings of selected cultivated forages, fodder trees, and postharvest feed and forage utilization innovations; and highlight key lessons evolving from the feed and forage action research and scaling interventions. The project established partnership with CGIAR and local partners, conducted participatory need assessment, prioritized researchable issues, identified and validated different forages and utilization innovations, and created development partnership to facilitate wider scaling. Training activities and multistakeholder platforms were used to enhance cross learning of project partners. The cultivated forages grown under farmers' fields and management conditions provided high biomass yield of good nutritional quality. For instance, oat (Avena sativa L.)-vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) mixture, lablab [Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet], vetch-desho grass (Pennisetum pedicellatum Trin.) intercropping, sweet lupin (Lupinus albus L.), alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), and fodder beet (Beta vulgaris L.) yielded on average 15, 3.4, 5.5, 2.9, 15.3, and 20.2 t dry matter ha(-1), respectively. Animal response trials showed an increase in milk yield of 30-50% with supplementation of oat-vetch mixture and fodder beet. Feed wastage was considerably reduced (>30%) due to the use of feed troughs and storage sheds, with high economic incentives to invest in such innovations. Integrating and intensifying feed and forage resources and postharvest innovations at farm level remains a priority to improve livestock productivity and food security."

The PMR diet contained maize silage, which compared with PMR diet contained sorghum-maize silage made from strip-cropped plants. Both fodder plants were harvested with a 4-row precision chopper, which cut 2 rows of maize and 2 rows of sorghum, giving mixed maize/sorghum forage. The feeding experiment lasted 84 days and consisted of four sub-periods, each 21 days in length to record milk yield, feed and milk chemical composition, and blood parameters. In addition to PMR diets containing part of ration compound feedingstuffs, the cows received part of compound feedingstuffs given at feed stations to meet their nutritional requirement. The compound feedingstuffs in station were controlled by an electronic system related to actual cow's milk yield. Chemical composition of both silages and milk production efficiency were compared. The average dry matter intake in both groups was 18.80 vs 20.4 +/- 1.95 kg/day, but compound feedingstuff intake from station was 3.61 vs 4.56 (P>0.01). Milk yield was 21.8 and 20.5 +/- 0.51 kg/day, respectively (P>0.01). The amount of standardized fat and protein content of milk (FPCM) was 21.0 and 20.2 kg/g +/- 0.48 kg/day (P >= 0.01). No significant differences were found in the fat, protein, casein, lactose, urea, total solids and solids not fat percentage of milk or in milk traits (acidity, renneting time, density) among groups (P >= 0.01). Feeding cows PMR ration with maize silage significantly elevated total cholesterol (P<0.05), but decreased urea levels in blood plasma (P<0.01). It is concluded that strip cropping of sorghum and maize could be an alternative to maize grown as a pure stand in maize high-risk areas for dairy cows in mid-lactation.

Agricultural management practices impacted carbon and nutrient concentrations in soil aggregates, with minimal influence on aggregate stability and total carbon and nutrient stocks in contrasting soils	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH			English	Article						"Tillage; Stubble; Aggregate-size distribution; Farming system; Soil organic carbon; Luvisol; Vertisol"	"ORGANIC-MATTER; NO-TILLAGE; LAND-USE; STUBBLE RETENTION; CLAY MINERALOGY; C SEQUESTRATION; SIZE FRACTIONS; NITROGEN; STABILIZATION; DYNAMICS"	Agricultural management practices can affect soil structure and soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrient stocks, which are important for sustainable agriculture. There is however limited understanding of the long-term impact of management practices on SOC and total nitrogen (N), sulphur (S) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in aggregates from different soils, and consequent effects on SOC and nutrient storage in agro-ecosystems. Soils from long-term (16-46 years) management systems in semi-arid (Luvisol, at Condobolin, NSW), Mediterranean (Luvisol, at Merredin, WA) and sub-tropical (Vertisol, at Hermitage, QLD) environments in Australia were collected from 0 to 10 cm, 10 to 20 cm and 20 to 30 cm depths. Dry- and wet-sieving techniques were used to fractionate the soils into mega-aggregates (> 2 mm), macro-aggregates (2-0.25 mm), micro-aggregates (0.25-0.053 mm), and silt-plus-clay particles, including micro-structures (< 0.053 mm) i.e. silt-plus-clay fractions. Management practices in the Luvisols comprised conventional (CT) and reduced tillage (RT) under mixed crop-pasture rotation, no-till (NT) under continuous cereal-cover crop rotation, and perennial pasture (PP) at Condobolin, and stubble either retained (SR) or burnt (SB) under direct-drilled continuous wheatlegume rotation at Merredin. The practices in the Vertisol comprised a factorial combination of CT, NT, SR, SB, with either 0 (0N) or 90 kg urea-N ha(-1) (90N) under continuous wheat-wheat rotation. In the Luvisol at Condobolin, the PP and NT had significantly (p < 0.05) higher soil aggregate stability than the CT and RT, with no impacts of management on SOC and total N, S and P stocks at all depths. The practices in the Luvisol at Merredin and Vertisol at Hermitage had no impact on soil aggregate stability, or on SOC and nutrient stocks at all depths, except the NT-SR-90N at Hermitage showed higher SOC (p < 0.10) and nutrient (p < 0.05) stocks than the other treatments at 0-10 cm only. The SOC and N concentrations were higher (p < 0.05) in the wet-sieved silt-plus-clay fractions and mega-aggregates than macro- and micro-aggregates in the PP and NT at Condobolin, and SR at Merredin, but were similar across aggregates in the CT and RT at Condobolin and SB at Merredin at 010 cm depth. Further, at Hermitage, SOC and N concentrations were similar among the aggregate-sizes across different treatments and depths. The only exception was the NT-SR-90N treatment, where SOC and N concentrations were higher (p < 0.05) in the silt-plus-clay fractions or micro-aggregates than in mega- and macro-aggregates, obtained by either dry- or wet-sieving. Total S concentration was in the order of macro- >= micro- > mega-aggregates across all the treatments and was higher in the PP at Condobolin (0-10 cm depth), and in the SR at Merredin (all soil depths) than the other corresponding treatments. Further, at Merredin, both SR and SB had higher P concentration in macro- and micro- than mega-aggregates. Across all the practices, SOC and N concentrations were higher in the dry- and wet-sieved silt-plus-clay fractions or micro- than mega- and macro-aggregates in both Luvisols, with no differences in the Vertisol. In summary, although the PP, NT, and SR (compared with other corresponding treatments at each site) had minimal impact on total SOC and nutrient stocks in bulk soils, these practices increased aggregate stability in some systems (i.e. Condobolin), and SOC and nutrient concentrations in the silt-plus-clay fractions or micro-aggregates in both Luvisols. These findings suggest that reducing soil disturbance and enhancing crop residue input in farming systems are important for SOC and nutrient storage, particularly in finer aggregate fractions.

Intercropping is a common crop diversification scheme that may bring complementary nectar sources for parasitoids and increase herbivore pest control. For instance, intercropping cereals with faba beans introduces nectar sources in usually sugar-devoid systems (i.e. cereal single crops). However, the nectar provision hypothesis has never been evaluated at the field scale in such intercropping systems. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated if sugar is a limiting factor for Aphidius parasitoids in single triticale crops and if their nectar feeding activity increases in faba bean-triticale intercrops. Aphidius feeding patterns were evaluated from their sugar profiles, using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In parallel, aphid density and parasitism rates were estimated at the edge and in the centre of single crops and intercrops. Sugar analyses revealed that honeydew was always the main sugar source for parasitoids, and although a significant proportion of parasitoid populations were recorded to feed on nectar, this proportion did not increase in intercrops. Besides, parasitism rates did not increase in intercrops, nor were aphid populations reduced. Thus, our results do not support the nectar provision hypothesis, but rather suggest that although nectar provision benefits parasitoid populations in some systems, its effects on biological control are highly context-dependent. They also confirm that honeydew can be a major food source for parasitoids, which may not necessarily be sugar limited at the field scale.

This research aimed to assess whether and to what extent a newly introduced legume-based intercropping system is able to ameliorate the biological fertility status of an arable soil in a way that is still noticeable during the succeeding durum wheat cropping season in terms of changes in bacterial community structure, soil C and N pools, and crop yield. A field experiment was carried out under rainfed conditions in Southern Italy on a sandy clay loam soil cultivated with durum wheat following in the rotation a recently established grain legume (pea, faba bean) barley intercropping. Soil chemical, biochemical and eco-physiological variables together with compositional shifts in the bacterial community structure by LH-PCR fingerprinting were determined at four sampling times during the durum wheat cropping season. Soil fertility was estimated by using a revised version of the biological fertility index. Results showed that even though the microbial biomass was significantly altered, the preceding legume intercrops stimulated C-related functional variables thus leading to an increased release of mineral N, which was larger in crop treatments succeeding pea-based than faba bean-based intercropping. The increased N made available in soil enabled the succeeding durum wheat to achieve an adequate grain yield with a reduced N-fertilizer use. Soil type and environmental conditions rather than crop treatments were major determinants of bacterial community structure. The biological fertility status was not varied, suggesting that in intensively managed rainfed areas long-term crop rotations with intercropped legumes are needed to consistently ameliorate it.

The effects of such innovations on important agroecological services such as yield and N recycling were assessed compared to those supplied by the other cropping systems.

However, the actual growth of intercropped species may differ resulting from the idiosyncratic effect of crop diversity, and with this, the realized benefits from intercrops are found to depend critically on the cultivar, species, management and environmental conditions. This study aimed to apply a trait-based approach, in which ecological niche spaces are defined through n-dimensional hypervolumes, to identify the contribution of species/cultivar, cultivation design (sole crop or intercrop) and management (low or high fertilization) to the trait diversity of four crop species, pea-barley and faba bean-wheat, when grown as sole crops and intercrops. Four traits were used as trait axes for the trait space analysis: canopy height, shoot biomass, tiller/node number, and grain yield. We found that trait spaces differed with crop species and cultivars, and whether they were grown as intercrops or sole crops. Trait spaces differed between high and low fertilization only for the cereals grown in the more productive site (i.e. Denmark). Species grown as intercrops had larger volumes than when grown as sole crops, as a result of trait plasticity. This response to intercropping was apparent in almost all the species grown in Sweden and Denmark, except for wheat in Denmark. The study demonstrated that individual species responded to intercropping compared to sole cropping through the plasticity of traits, which influenced the shape of the hypervolumes to divide up the trait space between the species. The findings are important in illustrating the plastic responses of arable crops, which are relevant for understanding the productivity of species grown in intercrops as compared to sole crops.

Fuzzy logic-based and field scale indicators were developed to evaluate the effects of pesticides and tillage on agroecosystems. All the assumptions and rules for making inferences reflect the current knowledge and the expert perception and judgment about the potential environmental impact of pesticides and tillage. The proposed indicators require four input variables: (1) number and type of applied pesticides, (2) rate of applied pesticides, (3) number and type of tillage tools, and (4) land capability class of each field. In regards to pesticide impact, the indicators consider the toxicity effects on: (1) mammals and (2) insects, while the tillage impact is evaluated taking into account the effects of different tillage operations on: (1) the retention of crop stubble on the soil surface, and (2) the stability of soil aggregates. Two overall outputs were obtained: (1) pesticide index and (2) tillage index. The developed indicators were used to compare the potential environmental effect of current practices carried out in Inland Pampa (Argentina). Concerning pesticide use, cropping winter wheat did less harm to the agroecosystem than cropping maize and sunflower. The overall values of tillage index were similar within crops. However, large differences in pesticide and tillage effects were found among tillage systems. Soybean showed the highest variability in both indexes. The type of analysis carried out in this study using farm-level variables may help find more sustainable ways to manage agricultural inputs. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In the study, all harvests were conducted at spike and milking period of triticale. The mixing ratios were 100% forage peas (FP), 100% triticale (T), 75% FP + 25% T, 50% FP + 50% T, 25% FP + 75% T. As the harvest periods delayed, crude ash, crude protein, digestible dry matter, dry matter consumption and relative feed value decreased where Acid Detergent Fiber (ADF) and Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF) rates increased. As the proportion of forage pea in the mixture increased, the ratio of crude protein and ADF increased, while the rate of digestible dry matter decreased. The spiking period of triticale was found to be the suitable harvest period. Sowing mixture at 25% FP + 75% T was superior obtaining good ADF, digestible dry matter and relative feed value. In the case of favorable NDF and crude protein ratios, 75% FP + 25% T proved to be superior to other mixture combinations.

Climate change impacts and farm-level adaptation: Economic analysis of a mixed cropping-livestock system	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						"Adaptation; Mixed farming; Dryland farming; Optimization; Profit; Climate change impacts"	"MEDITERRANEAN ENVIRONMENT; WHEAT PRODUCTION; MODEL; PRODUCTIVITY; AGRICULTURE; TEMPERATURE; PASTURE; GROWTH; YIELDS; CROPS"	The effects of climate change on agricultural profitability depend not just on changes in production, but also on how farming systems are adapted to suit the new climatic conditions. We investigated the interaction between production changes, adaptation and farm profits for a mixed livestock-cropping farming system in the Western Australian Wheatbelt. Crop and pasture production was simulated for a range of plausible rainfall, temperature and CO2 concentrations for 2030 and 2050. We incorporated the results of these simulations into a whole-farm bio-economic optimisation model. Across a range of climate scenarios, the impact on farm profit varied between -103% and +56% of current profitability in 2030, and -181% and +76% for 2050. In the majority of scenarios profitability decreased, and the magnitude of impacts in negative scenarios was greater than the upside in positive scenarios. Profit margins were much more sensitive to climate change than production levels (e.g., yields). Adaptive changes to farm production under extreme climate scenarios included reductions in crop inputs and animal numbers and, to a lesser extent, land-use change. The whole-farm benefits of these adaptations were up to $176,000/year, demonstrating that estimating the impact of climate change without allowing for adaptation can substantially inflate costs. However, even with adaptation, profit reductions under the more negative scenarios remained large. Nevertheless, except for the most extreme/adverse circumstances, relatively minor increases in yields or prices would be sufficient to counteract the financial impacts of climate change (although if these price and/or productivity increases would also have occurred without climate change then the actual cost of climate change may still be high).

The investigation was based on field experiments conducted at two sites characterized by marginal environmental conditions in south-west Germany in 1999 and 2000. The experiments included perennial species of rye (Secale cereale x Secale montanum), intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium), lupin (Lupinus polyphyllus) and linseed (Linum perenne). In some stands, white clover (Trifolium repens) was included as an undersown intercrop for improved N supply. It was found that maturation of the species differed by up to almost 6 weeks, and consequently the threshability of most mixed stands was not satisfactory. Nevertheless, mixtures of either of the grasses (rye or wheatgrass) with lupin or undersown clover proved to be more suitable than pure stands in most cases, for measures such as grain yield, weed suppression and stability of grain yield over years. The grain yield harvested in the experiments in 1999 was low, reaching about 2.7 t ha(-1) with rye, and decreased for most species in 2000. If improved genotypes were available, perennial grain crops could provide an alternative for arable cropping and set-aside areas under marginal conditions.

Control by fungicides and the use of resistant cultivars is possible, but there is a growing interest in alternative control methods such as crop diversification, particularly in low input agriculture. The aim of this work was to assess the potential of intercropping pea with other crops and of pea cultivar mixtures for powdery mildew management on pea crop. Results show a reduction of powdery mildew on pea when intercropped by replacement at a 50:50 ratio with barley or with faba bean, but not when intercropped with wheat. A barrier effect seems to explain a major part of this decrease, especially in the pea/barley intercrop. This hypothesis was further supported by inoculated seedlings under controlled conditions, where powdery mildew infection on pea decreased with the distance to the inoculation point, this decrease being larger in the intercrop with barley than in the intercrop with wheat and in the pea monocrop. Powdery mildew was also reduced in the mixture of resistant and susceptible cultivars, with infection decreasing with the increasing proportions of the resistant one. Overall, this work shows that crop diversification may be a good strategy to reduce powdery mildew in pea.

Influence of Sweet Potato/Maize Association on Ecological Properties and Crop Yields in Swaziland	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						"Cereal; Intercropping; Mixed cropping; Polycropping; Root storage crop; Soil temperature; Weed species distribution"	"BATATAS L. LAM.; WEED INFESTATION; TUBER YIELD; SOIL; MULCH"	"Sweet potato is a major root storage crop in Swaziland, whereas maize (Zea mays L.) is the staple food crop in Swaziland. In this experiment, sweet potato cv. Kenya was grown in the field and intercropped with maize cv. SC 603 with the objective of determining the effects of crop association on soil temperature, weed infestation and crop yields. Five plant population treatments (T) were investigated: T(1), Maize alone at 40,000 plants/ha; T(2), sweetpotato alone at 33,333 plants/ha; T(3), maize at 40,000 plants/ha, intercropped with sweetpotato at 33,333 plants/ha; T(4), maize at 40,000 plants/ha, intercropped with sweet potato at 16,666 plants/ha and T(5), sweet potato alone at 16,666 plants/ha. Soil surface temperatures were generally higher than temperatures at 10 cm depth; nonetheless there were no significant differences in soil temperatures among the cropping systems. The three most dominant weed species in all plots were Bidens pilosa L. (37.5-59.3% relative abundance), followed by Cynodon dactylon L. (15.7-43.6%) and Oxalis latifolia (7.1-18.7%). Sida rhombifolia (0-0.4%); Schkuhria pinnata (0-0.4%) and Leucas martinicensis (0-0.4%) were the three least abundant weed species. Land equivalent ratio (LER) values indicated that Sweet potato-maize mixture at the recommended sole sweet potato population (33,333 plants per hectare) was a better cropping system (LER, 0.77) than intercropping at 50% of the recommended Sweet potato (LER, 0.74). Correlation data showed that maize cob yield was not significantly con-elated to the 100-grain mass (r = 0.508; R(2) = 0.2581; N, 12); the resultant correlation of determination showed that 25.8% in the variation in cob yield could be ascribed to 100-grain mass. In sweet potato, correlation data showed that the number of tubers per plant was positively correlated to tuber yield ha(-1) (r = 0.676; R(2) = 0.4570; N, 16); from the co-efficient of determination, 45.7% of tuber yield could be associated with the number of tubers per plant. In conclusion, sweet potato monocropping was the best system; nonetheless, if it has to be intercropped with maize, there should be 33,333 and 40,000 plants ha(-1) of sweet potato and maize, respectively.

Factors influencing potential scale of adoption of a perennial pasture in a mixed crop-livestock farming system	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						"Lucerne; Economics; Australia; Dryland"	ECONOMICS	Evaluating the potential scale of adoption of a technological innovation or management practice at the farm business scale can help gauge the potential size of an industry for the purposes of prioritising resources for research and development. In this paper we address the question of quantifying the potential area of adoption of a perennial pasture, lucerne (Medicago sativa L.), in dryland mixed farming systems in Australia. Lucerne pastures play a significant role in dryland farming systems in the wheat-sheep zone of southern and western Australia. While there are benefits of integrating lucerne into cropping systems there will inevitably be additional costs, and the scale of adoption of lucerne will depend largely on the increase in farm profit resulting from the introduction of lucerne. Whole-farm economic models of representative farms in the Australian wheat-sheep belt were used to determine the key drivers for the scale of adoption of lucerne. For a particular farming system the optimal area of lucerne which maximises whole-farm profit is found to depend on production, price and cost conditions. Generally, no more than 30% of a farm was allocated to lucerne according to those conditions and location of the farm. For most scenarios examined the response of profit was flat around the optimal area. This implies that lucerne could be grown on areas greater than the optimum, in order to reduce groundwater recharge (and thereby reduce the risk of dryland salinity), without greatly reducing whole-farm profit. The optimal area of lucerne in all regions was limited by the area of suitable soil types and proportion of lucerne in the most profitable lucerne-crop sequences. At all price levels assumed in this study lucerne remained as part of the optimal enterprise mix for all farm types examined. Lucerne productivity was also a major determinant of the optimal area of lucerne. The sensitivity of profit to changes in winter and/or summer production varied between regions and for different livestock enterprises. The differences were driven by the timing of energy demands and supply of feed in individual farming systems. In all regions the optimal area and profitability of lucerne varied with livestock enterprise. The analyses showed that changing from wool production to meat production enabled greater economic benefit to be realised from lucerne. This was consistent across farm types and demonstrated the value of lucerne as a source of high quality feed for finishing prime lambs in summer. The results of this study demonstrate that lucerne is profitable in a range of environments on a significant proportion of the farm area, but that this area is small relative to that required to significantly influence in its own right the environmental issue of salinity.

It was clearly indicated that intercropping affected the relative resistance and susceptibility of cowpea cultivars. The resistance of TVU 946 to Maruca was reduced when the cultivar was under maize. This was attributed to the phenological changes observed, i.e. when planted with maize there was a significant (P = 0.05) increase in length of the pods and peduncles and significant (P = 0.05) reduction in the number of branches. Weekly mean temperatures and relative humidities indicated that there were significant differences between cropping patterns. Similarly there was a significant reduction in the photosynthetic active radiation incident on cowpea canopy in all the intercropped plots. This suggested that both intercropping and microenvironmental differences observed, reduced resistance in cultivar TVU 946 by probably acting directly on the crop, thus rendering it more susceptible.

This study evaluated the environmental impact of cultivation of five Swedish pulses (yellow peas, grey peas, faba beans, common beans and lentils) in a life-cycle perspective. The impact of selected Swedish pulses (conventional or organic) was then compared with that of imported pulses in Sweden, including contributions from processing, packaging and transport. The influence of origin and transportation mode and differences between home cooking and canned pulses (Tetra Recart) were considered. The impact of cultivation differed considerably between the Swedish pulses, ranging between 1.6-3.3 MJ, 0.18-0.44 kg CO2 e and 3.1-5.9 m(2) land use per kg dry product. In general, pulses with higher yield had lower cultivation impact. However, intercropping pulses and cereals showed potential to reduce environmental pressures, despite low per-hectare yield of the pulse crop. When processing, packaging and transport were included, the variation in impact was even greater, illustrating the importance of including post-farm activities in the assessment when comparing pulses. Emissions of greenhouse gases per kg cooked product ranged from 0.1 kg CO2 e for Swedish pulses purchased dry to 0.8 kg CO2 e for canned beans. Long transport distances contributed considerably to energy use and climate impact, particularly when the pulses were processed and packaged far from the final destination, due to high moisture content of the product. Origin affected also biodiversity impact, since the risk of species losses differs widely between ecoregions. Pesticide use is reported to be high in many countries, and residues are commonly found in many pulses. However, lack of data prevented comparisons of ecotoxicity or pesticide use for different imported pulses. The important role of origin and post-farm activities, in particular transport, for the environmental impact of pulses calls for increasing awareness and action amongst purchasers, food industries, and consumers to achieve more sustainable sourcing of pulses.

However, there is limited knowledge on the main traits involved in soil N uptake during early growth and for a range of species. The objective of this research was to identify the main traits explaining the variability among legume species in soil N uptake and to study the effect of the soil mineral N supply on the legume strategy for the use of available N sources during early growth. Nine legume species were grown in rhizotrons with or without N supply. Root expansion, shoot and root biomass, nodule establishment, N-2 fixation and mineral soil N uptake were measured. A large interspecific variability was observed for all traits affecting soil N uptake. Root lateral expansion and early biomass in relation to seed mass were the major traits influencing soil N uptake regardless of the level of soil N availability. Fenugreek, lentil, alfalfa, and common vetch could be considered weak competitors for soil N due to their low plant biomass and low lateral root expansion. Conversely, peanut, pea, chickpea and soybean had a greater soil N uptake. Faba bean was separated from other species having a higher nodule biomass, a higher N2 fixation and a lower seed reserve depletion. Faba bean was able to simultaneously fix N2 and take up soil N. This work has identified traits of seed mass, shoot and root biomass, root lateral expansion, N-2 fixation and seed reserve depletion that allowing classification of legume species regarding their soil N uptake ability during early growth.

Diversification of the cropping systems using notably cereal-legume mixtures is one key pathway for such agroecological intensification. Indeed, intercropping is recognised as a practice having the potential to increase and stabilise the yields in comparison with sole crops while limiting the use of inputs notably when species exploit resources in a complementary way. However, predicting intercropped species grain yield remains a challenge because the species respond to competition through complex genotype x cropping mode interactions. Here, we hypothesised that the grain yield achieved by a cultivar in low nitrogen input durum wheat-grain legume intercrops (ICs) could be estimated using a few simple variables. The present work is based on a 2-year field experiment carried out in southwestern France using two durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L.), four winter pea (Pisum sativum L.), and four winter faba bean (Vicia faba L.) genotypes with contrasting characteristics, notably in terms of height and precocity, to explore a wide range of durum wheat-grain legume phenotypes combinations to generate variability in terms of yield and species proportion. The major result is that the yield of durum wheat-grain legume IC component in low nitrogen input conditions could be correctly estimated from only three variables: (i) wheat cultivar full density sole crop (SC) yield, (ii) legume cultivar half density sole crop (SC1/2) yield, and (iii) an indicator of legume cultivar response to interspecific competition. The latter variable, the interspecific interaction index (IE), reveals cultivars' competitive abilities and tolerance to competition. However, to propose generic IC design and management procedures, further mechanistic understanding is required to better understand the links between tolerance to interspecific competition and cultivar phenotype characteristics. In particular, a special emphasis on the grain legume is needed as their response to interspecific competition appears less predictable than that of durum wheat. Cultivar choice is a key element to optimise the functional complementarity and subsequent IC advantages. This work proposes a simple tool to assist the design of specific breeding programs for cultivars ideotypes adapted to intercropping.</p>	"[Kammoun, Bochra; Journet, Etienne-Pascal; Justes, Eric] Univ Toulouse, INRAE, AGIR, Castanet Tolosan, France; [Kammoun, Bochra] ARVALIS Inst Vegetal, Paris, France; [Journet, Etienne-Pascal] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, LIPME, Castanet Tolosan, France; [Bedoussac, Laurent] Univ Toulouse, ENSFEA, INRAE, AGIR, Castanet Tolosan, France"		Bedoussac, L (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, ENSFEA, INRAE, AGIR, Castanet Tolosan, France.

Nevertheless, their areas in Europe have strongly decreased over the past decades. Our aim was to design locally adapted innovative cropping systems including grain legumes for three European local pedoclimatic contexts, to assess their sustainability, and to discuss their feasibility with stakeholders. The methodology included an initial diagnosis of the most frequent cropping systems and local improvement targets in each local context (e.g. improve legume profitability, limit diseases of legumes, reduce intensive use of chemical inputs in cropping systems), the design of innovative legume-based cropping systems during a common workshop, focusing on three aims ((i) decrease pesticide use, (ii) reduce mineral N fertiliser dependency, and (iii) increase yield stability of grain legume crops and other crops of the crop sequence), and their multicriteria sustainability assessment. Stakeholders meetings were organised in each local context to discuss the feasibility of implementing the innovative cropping systems in farmers' fields (technical implementation of cropping systems and possibility of development of legume sectors). Four to five cropping systems were designed in each local context, with crop sequences longer than references. They included at least two grain legumes (pea, faba bean, chickpea, lentil or lupine), as sole crops or intercropped with cereals. Overall sustainability was similar or improved in 71% of the legume-based cropping systems compared with their corresponding references. Among the designed cropping systems, stakeholders identified feasible ones considering both technical issues and development of legume sectors. The results indicate that reintegrating more grain legumes in the three European local contexts tested will contribute to more sustainable farming systems.

High demand for barley straw biomass in the system creates competition between the two uses. This study aimed to identify the determinants of the utilization of barley straw for mulch and feed. Data on the production and use of barley straw were collected from 236 households using a structured questionnaire. Use of the straw for the purposes of soil mulch at three levels, 0-15% (marginal mulching), 15-35% (optimal mulching), 35-100% (over-mulching), was analyzed using a multinomial logit model. The optimal proportion of barley straw used as soil mulch was positively affected by the educational level of the household head, family size, distance between cropping land and homestead, number of equines in the household and amount of straw production. Female-headed households were more likely to mulch less than the optimal amount of barley straw. In general, the more the farmer's exposure to formal extension, the less the proportion of barley straw used for soil mulching. This study provides guidance for the proportional utilization of barley straw. This will contribute to the design of appropriate biomass utilization strategies in barley-livestock farming systems.

J	"Van Phu, H; Mendoza, TC"				"Van Phu, H; Mendoza, TC"			Soil erosion and nutrient management in farming systems of the northern uplands of Vietnam	PHILIPPINE AGRICULTURAL SCIENTIST			English	Article						"upland farming system; soil conservation; soil cover; cropping systems; mixed cropping"		The predominant practice of 89% of farmers growing tillage-intensive annual crops such as upland rice or mixed annual crops was identified as the main factor causing massive soil erosion (more than 100 t ha(-1) yr(-1)) and nutrient losses in the uplands of Dinh Hoa, Vietnam. The early growth of these crops and their insufficient canopy cover to the soil coincide with the peak rainy months of June to August. It was estimated that 15 cm of the topsoil in Dinh Hoa would be eroded in about 10 yr for areas grown to upland rice at slopes of 25degrees-29degrees or in only 4 yr at slopes of 40degrees or higher. Burning of crop and weed residues, as done by 55.7% of the farmers, also brought about nutrient losses in cropping systems involving peanut-sweet potato, cassava and sweet potato-corn. But for root crops (sweet potato-corn, peanut-sweet potato, and bean-sweet potato and cassava), the greatest loss in N and K occurred through the harvest of economic products. Topsoils and nutrients were projected to be retained up to 100 yr in cassava+peanut intercropping and in farms planted to perennial crops such as tea or mixed fruit orchard. This demonstrates that the economic, environmental protection and conservation goals of upland farming in Dinh Hoa are potentially achievable. But 60% of farmers were not aware that improper farming practices caused soil erosion (hence, nutrient loss). Information and guidance, credit support, improvement of rural infrastructure such as roads and provision of processing facilities' could motivate farmers to shift to the planting of perennial high-value fruit trees. This cropping system would enable farmers to benefit from the unique subtropical climate of the uplands of Dinh Hoa in an environment-friendly way.

However, the rooting pattern of component species under intercropping, which is an important morphological feature considering the complementary uptake of nutrients, has been studied only rarely under field conditions because of inherent technical difficulties. We examined rooting patterns of three green manure species, both sole cropped and intercropped, using a newly developed multi-color staining technique. Species were chosen from different functional groups: sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.), a C4 grass; crotalaria (Crotalaria juncea L.), a legume; and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), a C3 dicot. We also investigated these species' aboveground biomass and N uptake. Sorghum distributed roots deeper under intercropping than under sole cropping; it was the most important contributor to increased biomass under intercropping. Crotalaria had a deep rooting system under both sole cropping and intercropping. Sunflower, with a shallow rooting system, was suppressed extremely under intercropping, possibly because of water deficiency in late in the season. The rooting patterns of green manure species examined using multi-color staining were related closely to the aboveground performance of these species under intercropping."

One goal of producing malting barley is to attain a defined protein content. This is challenging in organic farming because nutrient uptake is unpredictable. Since malting barley is quality sensitive to high amounts of available nitrogen (N) during the grain filling phase, artificial competition for N from a second crop within a mixed intercropping system could help to limit N uptake during these later growing stages. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of intercropping on the brewing quality parameters of malting barley within the framework of organic farming. In a field trial, with two spring barley cultivars (Odilia, Marthe) as sole crops and in intercropping treatments of 4 intermediate mixing ratios with camelina (Camelina sativa), linseed (Linum usitatissimum) and pea (Pisum sativum), the effects on yield and malting quality were observed. The results from three growing seasons on a study site in north-western Germany showed an opposite protein response for mixtures with linseed and pea. However, sole stands of barley mostly performed as well as the mixtures. For mixtures with camelina, neither yield nor quality aspects were affected. Comparing the two cultivars, the well-established Marthe, from traditional conventional selection, showed the better overall performance with a 13% higher grain yield, a 3% higher hectoliter weight and 5% higher proportion of size fraction > 2.5 mm than Odilia, which was released later from an organic breeding program. However, the yield component analysis showed a consistent yield determination for Odilia regardless of intercropping partner or mixing ratios which might indicate its suitability in polycultures. The observed average land equivalent ratios (LER) of mixtures with linseed (1.04) and pea (1.13) showed the potential to increase land-use efficiency but were lower compared to the mean LER found in a recent meta-analysis.

A field experiment including grain legume (pea, faba bean)-barley intercropping as compared to the respective sole crops (P100, F100 and B100) was carried out on a sandy clay loam soil in a Mediterranean environment. Row intercrops were established in an additive (P100/B50 or F100/B50) or replacement (P50/B50 or F50/B50) design. Soil chemical, biochemical and ecophysiological variables together with shifts in the bacterial community structure by DGGE community fingerprinting were determined at three sampling times over the cropping season. The impact of intercropped legumes upon the soil fertility status was assessed by calculating the IBF. Crop biomass production and weed suppression at the harvest stage were also determined. Results showed that the soil fertility status was not significantly increased and a few soil C and N-related biochemical variables were affected by the legume-based intercropping during the cropping season, suggesting that legume root-derived substrates stimulate microbial mineralization thus leading to an increase of the available-N pool in soil. The bacterial community structure was resilient to crop treatments. Pea-barley intercropping in replacement design provided a more stable yield (in terms of aboveground biomass production) and a lower weed infestation.

Traditionally, intercropping systems have been developed and improved by empirical methods within a specific local context. To support the development of promising intercropping systems, the individual species that are part of an intercrop can be subjected to breeding. Breeding for intercropping aims at resource foraging traits of the admixed species to maximize niche complementarity, niche facilitation, and intercrop performance. The breeding process can be facilitated by modeling tools that simulate the outcome of the combination of different species' (or genotypes') traits for growth and yield development, reducing the need of extensive field testing. Here, we revisit the challenges associated with breeding for intercropping, and give an outlook on applying crop growth models to assist breeding for intercropping. We conclude that crop growth models can assist breeding for intercropping, provided that (i) they incorporate the relevant plant features and mechanisms driving interspecific plant-plant interactions; (ii) they are based on model parameters that are closely linked to the traits that breeders would select for; and (iii) model calibration and validation is done with field data measured in intercrops. Minimalist crop growth models are more likely to incorporate the above elements than comprehensive but parameter-intensive crop growth models. Their lower complexity and reduced parameter requirement facilitate the exploration of mechanisms at play and fulfil the model requirements for calibration of the appropriate crop growth models."

Uncertainty about light interception efficiency epsilon(I) and biological efficiency epsilon(B) (i. e., corresponding to the conversion of solar energy into dry matter) was also investigated. In pure stands, estimation of epsilon(I) as a function of time by combining two empirical relations led to errors ranging from -0.1 to +0.1 with systematic bias. However, consequences on epsilon(B) were quite unsignificant with a maximum deviation of 0.05 g. MJ(-1). In mixed stands, uncertainty about light partitioning between the components of the mixture led to systematic over or under-evaluation of light interception efficiencies. Even if mean deviations in components' epsilon(I) were about 0.04, consequences on epsilon(B) were important since differences in Eg of 0.2-0.3 g.MJ(-1) could not be considered as significant. From an agronomical point of view, both species displayed similar behaviours in pure and mixed stands. In particular, mixing D. decumbens with A. pintoi did not result in an improvement of grass production, as generally expected in grass-legume intercropping.

Intercropping systems indicating multiple cropping within the same space may be used as an alternative production system which involves various plant species. This system reduces mineral N-fertilizer use and also improves soil physical and chemical properties. Thus, this study was carried out to investigate the effects of four different intercrops (i- barley+pea, ii- barley+vetch, iii- triticale+pea, and iv- triticale+vetch) in an olive orchard on biomass yield, and some physical and chemical soil properties in a two-year field experiment in South-East Turkey. The biomass yield, soil porosity, bulk density, penetration resistance, aggregate stability, and soil organic matter content have been determined at the end of each harvest. The highest biomass yield was recorded in triticale+pea, while the lowest yield was obtained under barley+vetch treatment. A significant positive relationship was determined between aggregate stability and biomass yield, in contrast significant negative relationship was obtained between penetration resistance and biomass yield. The results of the study clearly showed that intercrops (specifically triticale+pea) can be used to produce additional biomass for animal husbandry and improve soil quality in olive tree plantations.

However, it remains uncommon on commercial farms in Europe due to a number of socio-technical lock-ins and the many practical issues raised when integrating intercrops in cropping systems (e.g. which species, cultivars, sowing densities). Crop modelling is an option to explore integration scenarios and support farmers' decisions. However, available crop models are not able to simulate bundles of ecosystem services provided by a large diversity of binary cereallegume intercropping scenarios. To address this challenge, we developed a hybrid modelling chain that combines process-based, statistical and knowledge-based models to benefit from the strengths of these three different modelling approaches. The chain (i) simulates potential biomass of the sole cereal and legume crops independently using the crop model STICS; (ii) uses statistical interaction models built in R to convert potential biomass in sole cropping into attainable biomass in intercropping by considering competition effects among species, using a field trial database; (iii) converts attainable biomass into actual biomass by considering pest damage using a knowledge-based multi-attribute DEXi model, and also assesses control of pests (i.e. weeds, insects and diseases); and (iv) uses another set of multi-attribute models to assess five additional ecosystem services (i.e. cereal and legume grain yields, cereal protein content, nitrogen supply to the following crop and impact on soil structure) from the actual biomass of the intercrop at harvest and/or cropping system features. The chain was calibrated for grain cereal-legume intercrops sown simultaneously in a random pattern under low-input French conditions. We used an expert-based approach to assess the performances of each model and evaluate the accuracy of the entire modelling chain. In 18 simulated scenarios, 79% of the predicted levels of ecosystem services were consistent with experts' opinion. Predictions were more accurate for intercropping scenarios that included species from the trial database used to build linear interaction models (relative RMSE of 27-31%) but remained satisfactory for other intercropped species (relative RMSE of 32-37%). This is the first modelling chain able to assess bundles of ecosystem services provided by multiple cereal-legume intercrops in function of their cropping system contexts. This chain is intended to be included in an educational tool that is used face to face with farmers or students to design cropping systems that include intercrops."

Bispecific crucifer-legume cover crop mixtures are seen as a solution to increase biodiversity and to combine ecosystem services of both species. Legumes fix nitrogen while crucifers have the capacity to suppress pathogens due to the biocidal hydrolysis products of the endogenous secondary metabolites called glucosinolates (GSL). However there is a lack of information on the impact of plant-plant interactions in the crucifer-legume mixtures on crucifer GSL production compared to sole crop. The aim of our study was to assess GSL production of a wide range of bispecific crucifer-legume mixtures in comparison to sole crops. Experiments were conducted at two sites (near Toulouse and Orleans, France) over two years. Various cultivars from eight crucifer (Brassicaceae) species (rape, white mustard, Indian mustard, Ethiopian mustard, turnip, turnip rape, radish and rocket) and nine legume (Fabaceae) species (Egyptian clover, crimson clover, common vetch, purple vetch, hairy vetch, pea, soya bean, faba bean, and white lupin) were tested in sole crop and bispecific mixtures (substitutive design of 50%-50% sole crops). We show that for a wide range of species, crucifers in cover crop mixtures had the same GSL types, concentrations and proportions (aliphatic, aromatic and indole) as in sole crops. Crucifers in mixtures tended to have more biomass per plant, both for shoots and roots, than in sole crops so that the total GSL production per plant generally increased in the mixture compared to the sole crop. Thus despite halving the crucifer density in the mixtures the GSL production on an area basis declined by only 20%. These results have been validated for a wide range of crucifer species and provide support for crucifer-legume mixtures to produce nutrient-related services while potentially maintaining high GSL production. Specific experiments are needed to evaluate whether this double effect of unchanged GSL concentration and small reduction in GSL production has an impact on the biofumigation potential of cover crop mixtures compared to sole crucifers.

Their agronomic optimization remains a challenging task given the numerous management options and the complexity of interactions between the crops. Efficient methods for analyzing the influence of different management options are needed. The canopy cover of each crop in the intercropping system is a good determinant for light competition, thus influencing crop growth and weed suppression. Therefore, this study evaluated the feasibility to estimate canopy cover within an intercropping system of pea and oat based on semantic segmentation using a convolutional neural network. The network was trained with images from three datasets during early growth stages comprising canopy covers between 4% and 52%. Only images of sole crops were used for training and then applied to images of the intercropping system. The results showed that the networks trained on a single growth stage performed best for their corresponding dataset. Combining the data from all three growth stages increased the robustness of the overall detection, but decreased the accuracy of some of the single dataset result. The accuracy of the estimated canopy cover of intercropped species was similar to sole crops and satisfying to analyze light competition. Further research is needed to address different growth stages of plants to decrease the effort for retraining the networks.

This study presents empirical evidence of the relative importance of the consumption of dairy products to family nutrition and factors underlying differences among farm households. Cattle owning households (n = 270) and their under-5-year-old children (n = 225) were sampled for this study. Multiple approaches were applied for data collection, including a cross-sectional survey, in-depth household monitoring, a dietary diversity survey and anthropometric measurements of children. Household dietary diversity scores were low (4.6 +/- 1.3), mainly comprising maize, Enset, green kales and milk products. The consumption of non-dairy Animal Source Foods (ASF: beef, mutton, chicken meat, eggs and fish) was low, intermittent and peaked during major religious or social festivities. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) revealed substantial associations between anthropometric indices of children and socio-economic status of their parents. Specifically, predictors assigned the greatest weights, in descending order, were per capita farmland size, family size, access to clean water, crop diversity, dependency ratio, livestock holding, cash income, literacy of household head, distance to public health centres, and volume of milk available in the households. Although cow milk was identified as an important food item for children, their nutritional status was influenced by manifold factors that affect their dietary quality, health and care. Therefore, holistic approaches that embrace effective coordination among different economic sectors - notably agriculture, public health education and provision of clean water are required to achieve food and nutritional security among farming households.

Yield response to plant density of maize and sunflower intercropped with soybean	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Maize; Sunflower; Soybean; Intercrops; Plant density"	"MIXED CROPPING EXPERIMENTS; ALTERNATIVE APPROACH; DRY-MATTER; COWPEA; COMPETITION; PRODUCTIVITY; EFFICIENCY; RADIATION; HYBRIDS; GROWTH"	"Maize-soybean and sunflower-soybean intercrops have the potential for increasing yield per unit land area and time in fully mechanized farming systems. The objectives of this work were to measure the land equivalent ratio index of maize and sunflower intercropped to soybean, to assess the effects of plant density of its components, and to gain insight into ecophysiological processes affecting their yield determination. Maize-soybean and sunflower-soybean intercrops and their respective sole crops were grown at Balcarce, Argentina during two growing seasons. Treatments included a wide range of plant densities for sole and intercropped sunflower (2-9 plants m(-2)) and maize (4-12 plants m(-2)). Plants were harvested to determine shoot dry matter and grain yield per plot and at the individual plant level. Land equivalent ratio index (LER) increased 11% (mean of the two years) when plant density of sunflower was reduced from 6 to 3 plants m(-2); and LER increased 5% (year 1) or it was maintained (year 2) when maize plant density was reduced from 8 to 4 plants m(-2). Yield response to plant density of sunflower and maize influenced LER. The response to plant density of intercropped sunflower and maize grain yield followed the same pattern than that in a sole crop, and grain yield of intercropped sunflower or maize were lower than those for the sole crops at each plant density except at the lowest sunflower plant density. Yield reductions from sole crop to intercrop at each plant density averaged 20% and were associated (i) with lower intra-row spacing in the intercrop and (ii) with a lower shoot production rather than to a change in the dry matter partitioning to reproductive structures; in addition, detrimental effects of soybean over maize or sunflower yield were undetectable.

Intercropping fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) with and without biochar: Tests along a competition gradient	JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE			English	Article						"land equivalent ratio; legumes; LER; mixed cropping; relative yield total; replacement series; RYT"	"BIOLOGICAL NITROGEN-FIXATION; PEA-BARLEY; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY; CHEMICAL-PROPERTIES; MAIZE YIELD; ROOT-ROT; N USE; SOIL; CARBON"	Integrating soil amendment biochar to legume-based intercropping systems may amplify the intercropping benefits and lead to more sustainable production due to its positive effects on the soil physicochemical and biological environment. Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) is a legume used in an intercropping system in several countries in Southern Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. A barley cultivar and an Iranian fenugreek ecotype were studied in two replacement series experiments to find the best combination of the two species as well as the effect of adding biochar to the soil. Fenugreek and barley were grown in 4-L pots in five density combinations (20:0, 15:5, 10:10, 5:15, 0:20) with and without application of biochar in sandy loam soil. The biomass, nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) amount of the two crops were measured fifty days after sowing, and the Relative Yield Total (RYT) was estimated. Our results showed that biochar application resulted in a higher total biomass, N and C amount in all combinations of fenugreek and barley. Total biomass was increased by biochar 19.2% when fenugreek was grown alone and 8.1 and 12.9% in series with 25 and 50% barley when biochar was added, respectively. Biochar increased dry matter, N and C accumulation in both crop species in the mixtures. An exception was the C amount of barley which was not influenced by biochar in intercropping. RYT values were largest for biomass, C and N amount in mixtures with 15 fenugreek plants per pot and 5 barley plants per pot corresponding to approximately 400 fenugreek plants per m mixed with 130 barley plants per m(2). Biochar application increased RYT of the total dry weight by 2.7 and 5.5% in mixtures of 25 and 50% barley plants, RYT of the total nitrogen by 0.8% in mixtures with 25% barley plants, and RYT of the total carbon by 2.7 and 6.6% in mixtures with 25 and 50% barley plants. The RYT values declined with increasing number of barley plants as a result of a less competitive ability of fenugreek when growing in high barley densities. The yield was highest with intercropping but monoculture of barley also resulted in high yields. The total highest yield was found when approximately 130 fenugreek plants per m(2) were mixed with 400 barley plants per m(2). Mixtures with 75% fenugreek and 25% barley obtained RYT values larger than 1 for biomass, carbon and nitrogen percentages.	"[Bitarafan, Z.; Jensen, S.

We hypothesized that intercrops may have greater belowground productivity than sole crops, and sequester more soil carbon over time due to greater input of root litter. Here, we demonstrate a divergence in soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content over 7years in a field experiment that compared rotational strip intercrop systems and ordinary crop rotations. Soil organic C content in the top 20cm was 4%+/- 1% greater in intercrops than in sole crops, indicating a difference in C sequestration rate between intercrop and sole crop systems of 184 +/- 86kg Cha(-1)yr(-1). Soil organic N content in the top 20cm was 11%+/- 1% greater in intercrops than in sole crops, indicating a difference in N sequestration rate between intercrop and sole crop systems of 45 +/- 10kg Nha(-1)yr(-1). Total root biomass in intercrops was on average 23% greater than the average root biomass in sole crops, providing a possible mechanism for the observed divergence in soil C sequestration between sole crop and intercrop systems. A lowering of the soil N-15 signature suggested that increased biological N fixation and/or reduced gaseous N losses contributed to the increases in soil N in intercrop rotations with faba bean. Increases in soil N in wheat/maize intercrop pointed to contributions from a broader suite of mechanisms for N retention, e.g., complementary N uptake strategies of the intercropped plant species. Our results indicate that soil C sequestration potential of strip intercropping is similar in magnitude to that of currently recommended management practises to conserve organic matter in soil. Intercropping can contribute to multiple agroecosystem services by increased yield, better soil quality and soil C sequestration.

Crop intensification through subsidies could have indirect impacts through gains/losses in income and purchasing power, as well as direct influences on local availability. An integrated household survey conducted multiple times in Malawi provided evidence-based insights into the complex interactions between agriculture and nutrition. The nationally representative dataset indicated that agricultural input subsidies did not preclude crop or dietary diversity. Two pathways of subsidy impact appeared to be operating: an association with diversified cropping for a direct influence on available food quality; and an association with adoption of modern maize varieties for an indirect influence through commercialization and income that supports diverse food purchases. Although crop diversity was positively associated with dietary diversity, we found that education, income, market access, and availability of improved storage technologies had higher influence on dietary diversity. Finally, we provide evidence supporting the need for complementary investments in both education and employment creation, particularly for female heads of households."

In this study, we tested if facilitative effects of bioirrigation or the competition for water dominate the interaction of two intercropped plants-deep-rooted pigeon pea (PP) and shallow-rooted finger millet (FM) before and during a drought. Additionally, we tested how the presence of a common mycorrhizal network (CMN) affects the balance between facilitative (i.e. bioirrigation) and competitive interactions between two intercropping species. Our results show that PP can indeed promote the water relations of FM during a drought event. Specifically, stomatal conductance in FM controls dropped to low values of 27.1 to 33.6 mmol m(-2)s(-1), while FM in intercropping treatments were able to maintain its stomatal conductance at 60 mmol m(-2)s(-1). In addition, the presence of PP reduced the drought-induced foliar damage and mortality of FM. The observed facilitative effects of PP on FM were partially enhanced by the presence of a CMN. In contrast to the facilitative effects under drought, PP exerted strong competitive effects on FM before the onset of drought. This hindered growth and biomass production of FM when intercropped with PP, an effect that was even enhanced in the presence of a CMN. The results from our study thus indicate that in intercropping, deep-rooted plants may act as bioirrigators for shallow-rooted crops and that a CMN can promote these facilitative effects. However, the interspecific competition between the intercropped plants under conditions of abundant moisture supply can be strong and are enhanced by the presence of a CMN. In more general terms, our study shows that the extent by which the antagonistic effects of facilitation and competition are expressed in an intercropping system strongly depends on the availability of resources, which in the case of the present study was water and the presence of biotic interactions (i.e. the presence of a CMN).

Intercropping with Spring Barley and with White Clover: Benefits and Competitive Effects	AGRONOMY-BASEL			English	Article						"Papaver somniferum L.; mixed cropping; polyculture; weeds; competition"	"LAND EQUIVALENT RATIO; WEED SUPPRESSION; SOLE CROPS; N USE; YIELD; PRODUCTIVITY; ABILITY; EFFICIENCY; ADVANTAGES; TRIALS"	Poppy seed production is susceptible to abiotic and biotic stress and weed infestation, which introduces the risk of total crop failure. For the purpose of risk minimization, poppy was grown in additive intercropping systems with early and late sown white clover and spring barley sown at three different densities in a three year field trial to assess their roles in poppy cropping while adding ecological benefits to the crop rotation. Poppy yielded between 798.7 and 1293.1 kg ha(-1), with no significant yield effects of intercropping with white clover, compared to poppy sole-cropping. Dry matter, height, leaf area index and C/N ratio of the poppy plants were not significantly impacted by the clover intercrop either, independent on its sowing date. Higher poppy yields (695.6-918.8 kg ha(-1)) and LERs (1.11-1.84) in the poppy-barley intercrop were achieved in 2018 and 2020 compared to 2019 (<= 361.5 kg ha(-1), LER <= 0.99), mainly due to differences in seeding dates, precipitation and nutrient availability. Therefore, previous seeding of poppy limits competition when intercropped with barley while white clover and poppy can be sown at the same time. The effect of barley seeding densities on the intercrop performance was small as was the influence of intercropping on weed cover, number and biomass. The weed regulating effect needs to be further examined, however, we conclude that intercropping of poppy is a promising strategy for its cultivation, in terms of minimizing the risk of total yield losses when precisely managed.

Better access to agricultural advisory and financial services may play an important role in enhancing crop productivity. Using a dataset of 240 farmers collected through face-to-face interviews in 48 villages of district Sargodha in Punjab, Pakistan, this study analyzes farmers' access to and use of farm advisory and financial services, its impact on wheat productivity and barriers to their access. The results of the study revealed that farmers rely more on informal sources for agricultural advisory and credit services than public or private sources. However, the quality of private advisory and credit services was reported better than other sources due to its easy availability and processing. Small land holdings, lack of education and high interest rates were some of the key barriers that restrict farmers' access to both services. Further, the study also found that majority of the farmers (accessors) use agricultural credit for non-farm activities for several reasons. Moreover, the study found significant differences in the wheat productivity for farmers who had simultaneous access to both services compared to those who have access to at least one or none of the services. The study findings showed that access to agricultural advisory services improves wheat productivity. However, productivity gains of using agricultural credit are mainly associated with its proper utilization for agricultural purposes. The study suggests enhancing the outreach and quality of public advisory services through hiring and training extension staff. Furthermore, misuse of agricultural credit and barriers that restrict farmers' access to advisory and credit services need to be eliminated through implementing effective policies and monitoring provided services.

Crucifer-legume cover crop mixtures could be an effective solution for obtaining these two ecosystem services because they combine advantages of both species. However, crucifers might be a poor companion crop due to their high competition for abiotic resources and a potential allelopathic effect on legumes when grown with them. The aim of our study was to assess performances of a wide range of bispecific crucifer-legume mixtures to provide both catch crop and green manure services. A two-year experiment was conducted at two sites (near Toulouse and Orleans, France) where cultivars from eight crucifer species (rape, white mustard, Indian mustard, Ethiopian mustard, turnip, turnip rape, radish and rocket) and nine legume species (Egyptian clover, crimson clover, common vetch, purple vetch, hairy vetch, pea, soya bean, faba bean, and white lupin) were tested in sole-crop and bispecific mixtures (substitutive design of 50%-50% sole crops). We measured cover crop biomass and N acquisition to assess the soil nitrate catch crop service and N green manure service for the subsequent cash crop. In all experiments, compared to bare soil, crucifer-legume mixtures and crucifer sole cover crops provided the same level of nitrate catch crop service by reducing soil mineral N by an average of 59%, while legume sole cover crops reduced it by at least 35%, which is significant. In addition, within 6 months after termination, crucifer-legume mixtures mineralised more N (mean of 22 kg N ha(-1)) and thus had a larger N green manure effect for the subsequent cash crop than crucifer sole cover crops (mean of 8 kg N ha(-1)). This was due to greater N acquisition and a lower C:N ratio of crucifer-legume mixtures; even though crucifers always had advantage in acquiring N, legumes acquired enough N to provide an effective green manure service. These results were consistent in all of our experiments, which represent a wide range of crucifer-legume cover crops, demonstrating their generality. They also demonstrate the compatibility and complementarity of these species when grown together. In conclusion, combining crucifers and legumes as cover crops is an effective solution for obtaining multi-ecosystem services related to N recycling by providing both nitrate catch crop and N green manure services."

It is hypothesized that innovations that improve productivity and market linkages also improve returns and viability. The viability of smallholder dairying in Wedza was characterised by interviewing 52 households using semi-structured questionnaires. Information on demographics, production, marketing, livestock numbers, assets and constraints was obtained. Farmers were resource-constrained with differences in access to resources. The highly resourced farmers had higher milk output and numbers of livestock. Almost 40 % of the households were female-headed, and these dominated the poor category. Household sizes ranged from 4 to 13 persons. Milk off-take was low (3.7 +/- 0.53 l/cow/day), due to various constraints. Only rich farmers had viable enterprises in purely financial terms. Per litre cost of milk was more than selling price (US$0.96) for most farmers except the relatively rich. Operating ratios were 1.7, 0.6, 1.4 and 1.1 for the poor, rich, sub-centre and milk collection centre farmers, respectively. This means incomes from the dairy activities did not cover costs. Sensitivity analysis indicated that increases in total variable costs and labour reduced returns. Milk production and viability were influenced by access to resources and markets.

The root growth was evaluated by the root intensity on the rhizotron surface, root depth and plant uptake of N-15 injected into the soil at the deeper part of the red clover root system. Competition with red beet decreased clover root intensity in deeper soil layers compared to clover grown as sole crop. The difference between clover in sole crop and in mixture was not evident at the highest N supply because the root growth of clover in sole crop appeared to be lowered at high N level. Increased N supply increased the dominance of red beet, but generally did not alter the root growth and distribution of the two species grown in mixture. Clover root growth and rooting depth were inhibited by competition with red beet but the effect was not enhanced by increased N supply; hence the increased dominance of red beet at higher N level was likely due to its increased growth and competitiveness for other soil resources."

Here we show for the first time a new crop-livestock system: farming Muscovy ducks in maize fields (FD). To test whether FD is a practicable crop-livestock system, we conducted a 3-year field experiment to explore the growth and weight performance of Muscovy ducks in FD and to compare the FD with conventional maize planting (CMP) and raising ducks indoors (RDI) regarding crop growth and yield, weed biomass and density, feed conversion ratio, and economic benefits. We found that Muscovy ducks could adapt and thrive in maize fields with grain supplementation. The average weight per duck in FD at the harvest stage of maize was 2.24-3.82 kg, which met the local market standard and was higher than in RDI with a lower feed conversion ratio. When compared to CMP, FD did not significantly reduce the maize production in terms of yield or biomass, although the ducks fed on or damaged an average of four maize leaves. Importantly, FD significantly reduced the weed biomass and density. In addition, the net present value (NPV) of FD was $ 6690.47 per ha or $ 10.993 per duck, which was three times and 22.8% greater than those of CMP and RDI, respectively. These results indicated that FD, as a new crop-livestock system on dry land at the field scale, can promote sustainable agricultural production and act as a potential crop-livestock system due to the large global maize area.

The aim was to assess yield advantage and to analyse competition and niche differentiation using a hyperbolic regression model. It proved advantageous to grow barley and wheat in mixtures because more land area was required to obtain the same yield in sole crops. The hyperbolic regression approach confirmed that barley and wheat grown in mixtures resulted in yield advantages as a result of complementary use of resources. Barley showed greater competitive ability than wheat. for wheat, interspecific competition was larger than the intraspecific competition while for barley the intraspecific competition was greater than the interspecific competition. Niche differentiation indices were always above 1.0 indicating that the component crops did not inhibit each other from sharing resources in a complementary way.

We utilized C-13 and N-15 signatures of soil organic matter to assess how rapidly wheat/maize cropping contributed to the humus formation in coarse-textured savanna soils of the South African Highveld. Composite samples were taken from the top 20 cm of soils (Plinthustalfs) cropped for lengths of time varying from 0 to 98 years, after conversion from native grassland savanna (C4). We performed natural 13C and 15N abundance measurements on bulk and particle-size fractions. The bulk soil delta C-13 values steadily decreased from -14.6 in (C4 dominated) grassland to -16.5%o after 90 years of arable cropping. This delta C-13 shift was attributable to increasing replacement of savanna-derived C by wheat crop (C3) C which dominated over maize (C4) inputs. After calculating the annual C input from the crop yields and the output from literature data, by using a stepwise C replacement model, we were able to correct the soil delta C-13 data for the irregular maize inputs for a period of about one century. Within 90 years of cropping 41-89% of the remaining soil organic matter was crop-derived in the three studied agroecosystems. The surface soil C stocks after 90 years of the wheat/maize crop rotation could accurately be described with the Rothamsted Carbon Model, but modelled C inputs to the soil were very low. The coarse sand fraction reflected temporal fluctuations in C-13 of the last C-3 or C-4 cropping and the silt fraction evidenced selective erosion loss of old savanna-derived C. Bulk soil N-15 did not change with increasing cropping length. Decreasing delta N-15 values caused by fertilizer N inputs with prolonged arable cropping were only detected for the coarse sand fraction. This indicated that the present N fertilization was not retained in stable soil C pool. Clearly, conventional cropping practices on the South African highlands neither contribute to the preservation of old savanna C and N, nor the effective humus reformation by the crops.

Unfortunately, due to the low number of studies in the region there is still much uncertainty on how management activities can affect these emissions. To help reduce this uncertainty, we measured GHG emissions from three maize (Zea mays) growing seasons in central Kenya. Treatments included: (1) a no N application control (C); (2) split (30% at planting and 70% 1 month after planting) mineral nitrogen (N) applications (Min-100 kg N ha(-1)); (3) split mineral N + irrigation (equivalent to 10 mm precipitation every three days-MI); (4) split mineral N + 40 kg N ha(-1) added as manure (MM-total N = 140 kg ha(-1)); and (5) split mineral + intercropping with faba beans (Phaseolus vulgaris-MB). Soil CO2 fluxes were lower in season 1 compared to seasons 2 and 3 with fluxes highest in Min (p = 0.02) in season 2 and lowest in C (p = 0.02) in season 3. There was uptake of CH4 in these soils that decreased from season 1 to 3 as the mean soil moisture content increased. Cumulative N2O fluxes ranged from 0.25 to 2.45 kg N2O-N ha(-1), with the highest fluxes from MI during season 3 (p = 0.01) and the lowest from C during season 1 (p = 0.03). The average fertilizer induced emission factor (0.36 +/- 0.03%) was roughly one-third the default value of 1%. Soil moisture was a critical factor controlling GHG emissions in these central Kenya highlands. Under low soil moisture, the soils were CH4 sinks and minimal N2O sources."

Improving Livestock Water Productivity (LWP) is one of the approaches to address those problems. LWP is defined as the ratio of livestock's beneficial outputs and services to water depleted in their production. Increasing LWP can help achieve more production per unit of water depleted. In this study we assess the spatial variability of LWP in three farming systems (rice-based, millet-based and barley-based) of the Gumera watershed in the highlands of the Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia. We collected data on land use, livestock management and climatic variables using focused group discussions, field observation and secondary data. We estimated the water depleted by evapotranspiration (ET) and beneficial animal products and services and then calculated LWP. Our results suggest that LWP is comparable with crop water productivity at watershed scales. Variability of LWP across farming systems of the Gumera watershed was apparent and this can be explained by farmers' livelihood strategies and prevailing biophysical conditions. In view of the results there are opportunities to improve LWP: improved feed sourcing, enhancing livestock productivity and multiple livestock use strategies can help make animal production more water productive. Attempts to improve agricultural water productivity, at system scale, must recognize differences among systems and optimize resources use by system components. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Early-maturing maize (Zea mays L. cv. Suwan1) and Tephrosia bracteolata Guill. and Perr. (tephrosia), Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet (lablab) and Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC. (mucuna) monocultures as well as their mixture at three planting times-same day, 2 weeks after planting (WAP) and 4 WAP of maize-were arranged in a randomised complete block design with three replications. After harvesting fresh maize cobs, herbage samples (maize stover and legumes) from each plot were mixed together in ratios of 50: 50 and 70: 30 (maize: legume) for chemical analysis. Legume type and time of undersowing significantly affected (P < 0.05) the height and spread of maize from 4 to 6 WAP maize. Legume type and time of undersowing influenced fresh cob weight with the highest (P < 0.05) cob weight and grain yield recorded from maize undersown with tephrosia 2 WAP maize. Undersowing affected dry matter yield, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber concentrations. It is concluded that intercropping of early-maturing maize and legumes can substantially increase forage quantity and quality compared with maize monocultures.

First, crop rotations are identified as a suitable tool for the assessment of the long-term effects of perennial polycultures on ecosystem services, which are not visible at the single-crop level. Second, the ability of perennial polycultures to support ecosystem services when used in crop rotations is quantified through eight agricultural ecosystem services. Legume-grass mixtures and wildflower mixtures are used as examples of perennial polycultures, and compared with silage maize as a typical crop for biomass production. Perennial polycultures enhance soil fertility, soil protection, climate regulation, pollination, pest and weed control, and landscape aesthetics compared with maize. They also score lower for biomass production compared with maize, which confirms the trade-off between provisioning and regulating ecosystem services. However, the additional positive factors provided by perennial polycultures, such as reduced costs for mineral fertilizer, pesticides, and soil tillage, and a significant preceding crop effect that increases the yields of subsequent crops, should be taken into account. However, a full assessment of agricultural ecosystem services requires a more holistic analysis that is beyond the capabilities of current frameworks.

Reducing the yield gap - the difference between actual and (water-limited) potential yield - has wide implications for food security and policy. In this paper we combine stochastic frontier analysis of household survey data with agronomic information on (water-limited) potential yield to decompose the maize yield gap in Ethiopia and highlight policy solutions to reduce the yield gap. Our analysis suggests that lack of access to advanced technologies makes up the largest component of the maize yield gap but market imperfections, economic constraints and management constraints are also important determinants. Potentially, maize production can be increased almost fivefold if all these constraints would be addressed simultaneously and the yield gap could be fully closed. Another finding of the paper is measurement issues in the national household survey (LSMS-ISA), a key source of information for scientists to assess agricultural policies in Ethiopia and other African countries. A comparison with results from a crop model suggests a large number of unrealistic values related to key maize input and output variables. Combining economic and agronomic approaches is therefore not only useful to identify policies to reduce maize yield gaps, but also to assess and improve the quality of data-bases on which recommendations are made.

AMF spore were assessed in field and trap cultures (sorghum) using morphological tools. AMF inoculums potential were assessed using undisturbed soil cores planted with sorghum and cow pea. A total of 15 AMF species, dominated by species belonging to genus Acaulospora and Scutellospora were recorded across the MME. Wet region recorded high spore density and species richness in trap cultures. Human related disturbances caused by overgrazing and deforestation outside protected core altered AMF species composition in grassland, and negatively affected AMF species richness in woodland and grassland in the dry region. Similarly, intensified agriculture declined AMF diversity in dry region, but was unaffected in the wet region. Among different cropping systems, subsistence farming systems had higher AMF diversity and species numbers.

J	"Ahokas, H; Manninen, ML"				"Ahokas, H; Manninen, ML"			Retrospecting genetic variation of Finnish oat (Avena sativa) landraces and observations on revived lines grown prior to 1957	GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION			English	Article						"avenin; coeliac; fatty acids; mixed crops; polymorphism; residual grain proteins"	"ALKALINE-SOLUTIONS; CELIAC-DISEASE; BARLEY; GERMINATION; DIVERSITY; ISOZYMES; GRAIN; WHEAT"	An aged seed sample of a single oat landrace resulted in four plants when germinated. The plants differed from each other morphologically and genetically. They represented four grain types, three lemma colours, three avenin and three residual grain protein patterns and two molar ratios of C18:C16 fatty acids. These old oats grew high under current conditions and some also had yielding potential. Landraces with wide residual to avenin protein ratios would have been good sources in breeding food cereals for coeliac patients. Literature data since the 1700s indicate that Finnish oat landraces included morphological mixtures. Some were intentionally mixed. As also noted for Finnish barley landraces, oat landraces appear to have approached mixtures of genetically unique plants. Several reasons for the variation are presented. Active replacement of landraces (genetic polymorphism) with only a few pure-line cultivars was encouraged by authorities during the Mendelian period. Genetic variation was lost earliest in oats among Finnish cereal landraces. The proportion of oat landraces declined from 100% in 1902 to 34.4% in 1922 and to 0.2% in 1955. Genetic conservation did not occur in time, resulting from lack of foresight by authorities.

The objective of this study was to understand how the combination of crop diversification practices influences the performance of arable crop sequences in terms of crop grain yield, crop and weed biomass, and nitrogen acquisition in a temperate climate. Two field experiments were carried out. The first was a 3-year crop sequence with cereal or grain legume as the first crops, with and without undersown forage legumes and forage legume-grass crops, followed by a cereal crop. The second experiment was a 2-year crop sequence with cereal or legume as the first crops, a legume cover crop, and a subsequent cereal crop. For the first time, crop diversification practices were combined to identify plant-plant interactions in spatial and temporal scales. The results partly confirm the positive effect of diversifying cereal-based cropping systems by including grain legumes and cover crops in the crop sequence. Legume cover crops had a positive effect on subsequent cereal grain yield in one of the experiments. Using faba beans as the first crop in the crop sequence had both a positive and no effect on crop biomass and N acquisition of the subsequent cereal. In cover crops composed of a forage legume-grass mixture, the grass biomass and N acquisition were consistently increased after the grain legume, compared to the cereal-preceding crop. However, differences in the proportion of legume to grass in mixture did not influence crop yield or N acquisition in the subsequent cereal. In conclusion, these results support that increased crop diversity across spatial and temporal scales can contribute to resource-efficient production and enhance the delivery of services, contributing to more sustainable cropping systems.

Measurements on weed and cover crop growth were taken approximately 2 mo after seeding when cover crops were killed. Cover crops were killed by mowing in 1996 and by undercutting in 1997 and 1998. Cover crop biomass, averaged over rye-pea proportion, was highest in 1998 at 4.3 million tons (MT)/ha (high seeding rate) and lowest in 1997 at 1.5 MT/ha (low seeding rate). Cover crops of pure rye or rye-pea mixes suppressed weeds more effectively than did pure pea. Dominant weeds were ladysthumb, smooth pigweed, smallflower galinsoga, and common lambsquarters. Ground cover by weeds ranged from a low of 2% (rye-pea mixes) to a maximum of 73% (pure pea). Cover crop mixes of 50% or more rye seeded at the high rate gave the best weed suppression.

Despite the holistic approach that bears the designing of ICLS, fertilization practices are proceeded in a conventional crop basis, disregarding nutrient fluxes at the appropriate spatial and temporal dynamics. We argue that fertilization practices in ICLS must follow the same integrated approach. To test this, we compared a conventional crop fertilization strategy versus a system fertilization approach applied to two production systems being a conventional cropping system and ICLS. The conventional cropping system consisted of a soybean crop succeeded by a non-grazed Italian ryegrass cover crop. The ICLS model consisted of a soybean-Italian ryegrass rotation grazed by sheep. In the conventional crop fertilization strategy phosphorus and potassium were applied at soybean sowing and nitrogen at the Italian ryegrass establishment. The system fertilization consisted of the application of all nutrients during the Italian ryegrass establishment. Accordingly, treatments were fertilization strategies in a factorial framework with production systems randomly distributed in a complete block design with four replicates. Results indicated for the first time greater daily herbage accumulation rate (24%; P < 0.01) and total herbage production (18%; P < 0.05) in the system fertilization compared with conventional crop fertilization. Consequently, system fertilization allowed for greater stocking rates in the pasture phase (17%; P < 0.05). The ICLS presented greater equivalent soybean yield (P < 0.001), energy production (P < 0.01), and system productivity (P < 0.05) compared with the cropping system, regardless of fertilization strategies. Soybean yield was not affected by fertilization strategies or grazing. In conclusion, the adoption of system fertilization strategy and crop-livestock integration enhance the production without jeopardizing soybean grain yields, so that land use is optimized by a greater energy production per unit of nutrient applied."

Ensiled sorghum and soybean as ruminant feed in the tropics, with emphasis on Cuba	GRASS AND FORAGE SCIENCE			English	Review						"sorghum; maize; soybean; ensiling; ruminants; tropics; Cuba"	"LONG-SEASON VARIETY; MIXED-CROP SILAGES; NUTRITIONAL IMPROVEMENT; INTERCROPPED LEGUMES; MAIZE SILAGE; SOLE"	The concept is presented of combined cultivation of legumes and sorghummaize and their use as conserved ruminant feed in tropical regions, with special reference to Cuba. Good yields are obtained during the rainy season through intercropping (alternate rows of either sorghum or maize and soybean). When followed by ensiling, this provides high-quality ruminant feed for the tropical dry season. Soybean compensates for the low crude protein content of sorghum, whereas sorghum allows good silage quality in combination with legumes. The paper reviews and updates recent studies assessing combined sorghumsoybean cultivation and ensiling as well as determination of their feed value. The high nutritive quality and forage potential when these crops are intercropped demonstrate that silage from these plants can be used successfully in ruminant diets in Cuba and other tropical areas. Perspectives for new studies in this field are suggested, particularly with legume species that are more adapted to specific tropical regions and/or with higher forage yield. In addition, it is suggested that there is a need to assess the supplementation impact on meat and milk production at the farm level, as well as its environmental impact, when ruminants are fed combined silages from whole plants of sorghumlegumes.

The size of various N pools and decomposition of C-14-labelled ryegrass material were also investigated. Cultivation method (mouldboard of chisel ploughing) generally had no significant effect on the accumulation of mineral N in the profile in the autumn or on the amount of NO3--N leached over winter. C-14 measurements suggested that initial decomposition rate of plant material was faster from May than March cultivation treatments. Despite this, overall net mineralization of organic N (of soil plus plant origin) increased with increasing fallow period between cultivation and leaching. The total amounts of mineral N accumulated in the soil profile before the start of leaching were 139, 119 and 22 kg N ha-1 for the March, May and July cultivated soils respectively. Cumulative leaching losses over the trial calculated from soil solution samples were 78, 40 and 5 kg N ha-1 for the March, May and July cultivated soils respectively. Differences in N mineralization over the season were generally not reflected by changes in amounts of potentially-mineralizable soil N (as measured by extraction or laboratory incubation) or levels of microbial biomass during the season. The amount of mineral N in the profile in spring increased with decreasing fallow period. This was reflected in an approximately 15% and 25% greater grain yield and N uptake respectively by the following wheat crop in plots cultivated in July rather than in March.

Exploring maize-legume intercropping strategies for smallholder Conservation Agriculture farmers in Zimbabwe	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						"Sustainable intensification; Yield stability; No-tillage; Maize-legume systems; Green manures; Intercropping"	"YIELD STABILITY; CROPPING SYSTEMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOIL FERTILITY; STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; ORGANIC-MATTER; ROTATIONS; MANAGEMENT; PIGEONPEA; SOUTHERN"	Increasing threats of climate change and soil fertility decline enhance the risk of crop failure for smallholder farmers in southern Africa. The quest is to find cropping systems that provide yield stability while being sustainable. One of the strategies to use is intercropping legumes in maize-based Conservation Agriculture systems. Here, we present results of a three-year study in on-farm and on-station trials of Zimbabwe. We tested sole cropping compared to intercropping with different grain legumes and green manures as well as fertilizer application (in the case of on-station trials) on associated crop yields, total system yield, and yield stability. As methods, we used mixed modelling, best linear unbiased predictors estimation and additive main effects and multiplicative interaction analysis to analyse the data. The results show that intercropping systems with the selected legumes resulted in yield penalties. However, on-station sites showed maize/pigeonpea intercropping to be comparable to the sole maize in maize grain and biomass yield and to be superior in total system yield (108 GJ ha(-1) vs. 74 GJ ha(-1)). Comparison of intercropping against sole cropping revealed that sole maize out-yielded all intercropping strategies in all environments on-farm while the maize/pigeon intercropping strategy out-yielded sole maize in almost all environments on-station. In general, total system yield of intercrops out-yielded sole maize in most environments signifying the ability of intercrops to enhance cropping system yields. Stability analysis on-farm showed that intercropping with cowpea and jack bean was more stable compared to sole maize as a result of better systems performance across the environments. On-station, the maize/pigeonpea intercropping strategy was in general the most stable. We conclude that intercropping is a viable option for smallholder farmers. However, there is need to investigate other crop arrangements to reduce competition for both maize and the intercrop and double-row strip cropping may be an option.

Earthworm abundance, biomass and species composition under the two cropping systems in the second and third years of successive cropping were assessed each spring and autumn in farm-scale field plots at four sites using formalin and electrical extraction methods. The wheat-clover cropping system supported larger earthworm communities (overall mean abundance 548 individuals m(-2), 137 g biomass m(-2)) than conventional wheat monocropping (194 individuals m(-2), 36 g biomass m(-2)). Between one and five more earthworm species were recorded in the wheat-clover system than in the wheat system at three out of the four study sites. Wheat-clover cropping especially favoured species belonging to the epigeic and epigeic/anecic ecological groups such as Lumbricus castaneus, L. festivus, L. rubellus, juvenile Lumbricus and Satchellius mammalis. Earthworm communities in the wheat-clover cropping system were comparable in size and species composition to communities normally found in perennial grassland-type habitats such as pastures and grass-legume leys.

Virus spread was mainly monocyclic because BYMV killed infected lupin plants and between systemic movement and death there was only a brief period for BYMV acquisition and transmission to other plants by vector aphids. In plots with cereal borders, the rate and extent of BYMV spread into the lupins was decreased; at final assessment the numbers of infected plants were 43-60% less than in plots with fallow borders. Admixture with cereals also decreased the rate and extent of BYMV spread into lupin plots, numbers of infected plants being decreased by 76-96% at the time of final assessment. When lupins were sown at different seeding rates to generate a range of plant densities and weeds were removed, high densities decreased BYMV infection. The higher incidences of BYMV infection in sparse stands were attributed partly to smaller plant numbers and partly to incoming viruliferous vector aphids being more attracted to plants with bare earth around them, than to a plant canopy. BYMV infection decreased grain yield, of samples from infected lupin plants by 94-100%. In plots with 34% infection and sparse stands, grain yield was decreased by about one third. Plotted progress curves for the accumulated numbers of alate aphids of the BYMV vector species Acyrthosiphon kondoi and Myzus persicae resembled those for numbers of BYMV infected plants in 1990, but in 1991 only the curve plotted for M. persicae did so. There was a 2 week delay between the curves for aphid numbers and virus counts which reflected the time taken for obvious systemic necrotic symptoms to develop in lupins."

In this study, we observed that a narrow-wide-row planting pattern in maize soybean relay intercropping system (MS) improved the leaf greenness and green leaf area, delayed the leaf senescence process in maize and increased the photosynthetic rate of maize leaves during the reproductive stages of maize in MS. In a three-year field experiment, soybean was relay-intercropped with maize under different planting patterns (1M1S, 50 cm + 50 cm 1-row of maize and 1-row of soybean with an equal row distance of 50 cm; and 2M2S, 40 cm + 160 cm narrow-wide-row planting pattern, where 2-rows of maize were planted in narrow rows, and 2-rows of soybean were planted in wide rows, and 60 cm distance was maintained between the rows of maize and soybean) of MS, and both planting patterns of MS were compared with sole cropping systems of maize and soybean. Compared with 1M1S, planting pattern 2M2S significantly increased the number of green leaves (by 36%), leaf greenness (by 17%), and leaf nitrogen content (by 13%) at the dent stage (R5). The improved leaf nitrogen content in 2M2S at R5 significantly increased the green leaf area (by 16%, from 4170 cm(2) plant(-1) in 1M1S to 4960 cm(2) plant(-1) in 2M2S) of maize, indicating that leaf senescence of maize plants was delayed, which in turn significantly enhanced the photosynthetic rate of maize leaves at R5 by 57% in 2017, 75% in 2018 and 49% in 2019 than 1M1S. Overall, in 1M1S and 2M2S, relay-cropped maize produced 100%, and 89% of sole maize yield and relay-cropped soybean produced 27% and 66% of sole soybean yield, respectively. Importantly, compared to 1M1S, the decline of maize yield by 11% in 2M2S was compensated by a substantial increase in soybean yield by 147%, and 2M2S achieved the highest land equivalent ratio value of 1.54 compared to the land equivalent ratio value of 1.27 in 1M1S. Our results suggest that by selecting the appropriate planting pattern or stay-green maize hybrids, we can improve the land equivalent ratio of maize soybean relay intercropping system."

The Most Probable Number (MPN) of rhizobia cells capable of nodulating green grams were between 519 and 3,780 per gram of soil in SE-Kenya. These results were confirmed by lack of response to inoculation and effective nodulation of the control plants under field conditions. Green grams intercropped with maize had significantly higher dry weights than the ones grown as pure stand, 21 days after emergence (DAE). The increase was transitory because it was not observed at podding (42 DAE) and at physiological maturity (100 DAE). Green gram yield was mot affected by maize intercrop. However, maize yields were significantly reduced by intercropping with green grams. Soil analysis from treatment plots before and after the cropping season indicated that green grams increased soil nitrogen slightly or maintained it at preplanting levels. This was unlike pure maize plots where there was a decline in soil nitrogen (N).

The objectives of this experiment were to test the suitability of existing equations for estimating NDF of the alfalfa component of mixed stands, and to better understand how alfalfa is affected by the presence of grass. Stands of first-cut alfalfa and grass (10-90% grass) were sampled at two experimental sites and producers' fields in 19 New York counties during May and June 2004 and 2005. A range of plant measurements and environmental characteristics were recorded. The predictive equations for alfalfa quality (PEAQ) and other models were examined for applicability to mixed stand alfalfa NDF estimation. The R-2 values ranged from 0.80 to 0.87 and RMSE ranged from 20.5 to 25.2 g kg(-1). The most biased model was PEAQ, possibly due to the lower cutting height used to generate the PEAQ equation than the cutting height used in this study. For producer fields, a model based on alfalfa height was the best one-variable model, with R-2 of 0.84 and RMSE of 22.7 g kg(-1). Presence of grass increases the number of nodes and increases alfalfa height; however, the relationship between alfalfa height and NDF is not changed, suggesting that the predictive ability of models based on alfalfa height is not affected by the percentage of grass in the sward."

The agroecological practice of intercropping, meaning the simultaneous cultivation of two or more species in the same field, has recently gained renewed interest as a means of ecological intensification in European agricultural research. We discuss some recent research developments regarding 1) intercropping for ecological intensification in agroecological and conventional cropping systems, 2) studies on nitrogen resource use by cereal-grain legume intercropping cultivation, 3) the role of intercropping in the management of biotic stressors, especially weeds, and 4) intercropping as a means of creating cropping systems that are more resilient to the abiotic and biotic stress associated with climate change. Finally, we propose methods for the greater adoption of intercropping in European agriculture by unlocking farming systems from upstream and downstream barriers, with the aim of developing more sustainable agricultural and food systems.

Greenhouse experiments were carried out under three configurations (NC: no interspecific competition; FC: shoot and root interspecific competition; SO shoot-only interspecific competition). Despite large variations between replicate experiments associated with seasonal effects, the study revealed consistent patterns of competition for above- and below-ground resources. Light interception in FC and SC was dominated by potato (60%) during the first 45 days after planting and by maize thereafter (80%). The extra shade caused by the companion crop increased soil moisture by up to 10% in SC treatments. The yield of the two species responded in opposite ways to SC, which was consistent with asymmetric patterns of competition between the two species. In potato, FC reduced tuber yield (number and size) by 4-26%, while SC increased tuber size (compared to NC) by 3-39%. In maize, FC reduced LA1 and plant height by up to 45%, shoot and root dry mass, nutrient content, yield, the weight of 100 grains and harvest index by ca. 30-100%, while SC affected all but LA1 and plant height. It appears that the contrast between the progressive installation of the maize root system and the rapid early extension of the potato root system is amplified by the restriction of maize root development under competition, which leads to close interdependencies between root and shoot competitive relationships. Although the specific effects of root competition cannot be uncovered by this set of experiments, competition effects on maize in the potato/maize intercropping seem to primarily related to light availability in the mixed canopy.

A currently dominant plant substrate is maize silage. However, intensive cultivation of maize (Zea mays L.) as an energy crop in monocultures poses risk to the environment (soil erosion, depletion of soil nutrient supplies, increased concentration of pests-Ostrinia nubilalis). In this study, results of experimental methane production from silages of alternative substrates, such as fodder mallow (Malva verticillata var. crispa L.; FM), white sweet clover (Melilotus albus Medik.; WSC) and their mixture, are presented. Based on the dry matter yield of a mixed culture of mallow and sweet clover, the value of the land equivalent ratio parameter (LER) was set as 1.05. The obtained LER (>1) value shows that the cultivation of the two tested crops in the mixed culture is more beneficial than their monocultures. Methane production from all three silage variants was fully comparable with results of methane production from the maize silage. Anaerobic fermentation of the mixture of FM and WSC did not result in higher methane yield than the average result of monosubstrates."

Intercropped with Climbing Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)

The objective of the study was to test the performance of mixtures of maize and climbing beans as an alternative to monocropped maize under different site and management conditions. The effects of sowing density of maize and beans as well as the sowing time of beans on total dry matter (DM) yield and bean DM contribution to the total yield were investigated. Further, various mechanical and chemical weed control methods were tested and the resulting total DM yield was compared with that of a reference treatment (manual weeding). Hardly any consistent yield difference between maize/bean mixtures and monocropped maize occurred. The proportion of beans varied over a wide range among sites and was consistently higher when beans were sown at an early growth stage of maize. Mixtures did not suppress weeds efficiently and at two of the three sites their yield clearly declined with increasing weed coverage in the mixtures. A weed coverage of up to circa 10% may be tolerated, as the corresponding yield reduction is less than 1 t ha(-1). Considering the additional effort (i.e., two sowings, high costs for bean seeds, complicated weed control) in managing such mixtures, it can be concluded that maize/bean mixtures can currently hardly be recommended as an alternative to monocropped maize for feedstock production.

Two maize cultivars were mixed planting in two densities to explicit the potential of competitive interaction improving yield and water use efficiency in a semi-arid region over two growing seasons. During grain filling stage firstly, competitive interaction optimized stem to leaf ratio of two maize cultivars, and decreased root to shoot ratio at harvest under the same-high mixed planting density, great competitive intensity caused by high planting density suppressed vegetative growth of maize. Secondly, land equivalent ratio positively increased from 1.02 to 1.14, which signified the advantage of farming land use. Furthermore, positive values of total actual yield loss in the four mixed systems indicated a yield advantage. Over two years, mean yield and water use efficiency increased by 6.5 % and 11.7 % which resulted from the positive performance of two maize cultivars in the mixed systems. Thus, consequences of competitive interaction in the mixed planting systems performed as land use, maize yield and water use efficiency advantages in the dry land farming.

The aim of this study was to assess whether lodging could be reduced by changing the planting density through intercropping maize with soybean. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the effects maize-soybean strip intercropping, compared with sole cropping of maize, on stem and root characters, lodging resistance and yield of maize Maize was sown in strips intercropping as: M2S2 (maize-soybean intercropping with 2 row strips of each), M4S2 (maize-soybean intercropping with 4 row strips of maize and 2 row strips of soybean), M4S4 (maize-soybean intercropping with 4 row strips of maize and soybean) and M6S6 (maize-soybean intercropping with 6 row strips of maize and soybean) taking sole maize (M) and sole soybean (S) as control. Compared with its traditional sole cropping, maize-soybean strip intercropping changed the stem characteristics and root architecture of maize populations and significantly improved the lodging resistance. Specifically, plant height, ear height, and center of gravity height of strip intercropped maize was significantly lower; and stem diameter, average stalk crushing strength, and lodging resistance index of each node below the ear level were higher than that of sole cropping. The internode diameter, internode unit fresh matter weight, internode crushing strength, and internode unit bending force of stem internodes (2-10) of strip intercropped maize were higher than that of its sole cropping. Nodes 3-6 affected the lodging resistance of plants, and bar intercropping significantly enhanced the lodging resistance of the above key node positions. Morphological and physiological indexes of the intercropped maize roots were significantly higher than that of sole cropped maize and were positively correlated with stalk resistance index but negatively correlated with lodging rate. The composite yield of crops under different strip intercropping systems was in order as M4S2 > M > M4S4 > M6S6 > M2S2. Moreover, the land equivalent ratio (LER) of all the strip intercropping treatments was greater than 1.0. In conclusion, strip intercropping of maize with soybean seemed an effective and novel way to resolve lodging in maize coupled with its higher yield.

Recovery or compensation of maize and soybean after wheat harvesting	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"compensation; growth; intercropping; maize; nutrient acquisition; recovery and soybean"	"CONTRASTING CASSAVA CULTIVARS; PLANT-POPULATION DENSITY; RESOURCE USE; COMPETITION; GROWTH; CROPS; YIELD"	While early-maturing crops benefit from intercropping, late-maturing crops usually suffer growth penalties during the intercropping phase. It is possible, however, that recovery or compensation of the late-maturing crops occurs after the harvest of the early-maturing crops. Three field experiments were conducted at Baiyun in 1997 and at Jingtan in 1997 and 1998 to test the hypothesis in wheat/maize and wheat/soybean intercropping. The biomass and nutrient accumulation in intercropped soybean were significantly smaller than in sole soybean before wheat harvest but thereafter increased sharply at Jingtan site in 1997. The rates of dry matter accumulation in the intercropped maize (10.0-20.1 g/m(2) per day) were significantly lower than those in the sole maize (17.1-34.8 g/m(2) per day) during the early stage from 7 May to 3 August, while mostly intercropped with wheat. After 3 August, however, the rates of intercropped maize, increasing to 58.969.9 g/m(2) per day, was significantly greater than in sole maize (22.7-51.8 g/m(2) per day) at Baiyun site in 1997 and nutrient acquisition showed the same trends as growth. At Jingtan site in 1998, the disadvantage of the border row of intercropped maize resulted from interspecific competition diminished after wheat harvest and disappeared at maize maturity. It was concluded that then was indeed recovery of growth after wheat harvesting in wheat/maize and wheat/soybean intercropping. However, the recovery was limited under N0P0 treatment. The interspecific competition, facilitation and recovery are together contributed to yield advantage of intercropping. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we present a global meta-analysis of 36 studies, 66 experiments and 260 treatments addressing the land productivity of maize (Zea mays L.) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) intercropping. Data were extracted from the literature and analyzed with mixed effects models to assess the land equivalent ratio (LER) and the factors affecting LER. The worldwide average LER of maize/peanut intercropping was 1.31 +/- 0.03. The LER did not vary with continent, intercrop planting pattern and temporal niche differentiation, but sowing maize earlier than peanut (relative sowing time: RSTm<0) increased the partial LER of maize without significantly decreasing the partial LER of peanut. Increased N rate increased the partial LER of maize and decreased the partial LER of peanut but did not affect the total LER. This meta-analysis shows that maize/peanut intercropping is more land use efficient than the sole crops, it attains on average a win-no win yield advantage and mainly due to the maize.

Our objectives were to qualify and quantify soil organic and inorganic P compounds using sodium hydroxide-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (NaOH-EDTA) extraction and P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (P-31 NMR) in response to increasing complexity with integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLS) in subtropical Brazil. Soil at a depth of 0-5 cm was collected from three long-term (7 to 12 years) cropping studies with and without ruminant grazing of cover crops. All sites were managed under no tillage, and treatments with livestock were managed with moderate grazing intensity. In these agro-ecosystems, grazing compared with no-grazing had greater soil P content as total and bioavailable orthophosphate and lower soil organic P and fewer monoesters, including inositol phosphates. Grazing increased P bioavailability and reduced recalcitrant organic P concentration in soil; therefore, cropping systems that integrate livestock (ICLS) can be a sustainable alternative to improve P use in farming systems of subtropical Brazil.

This loss of biodiversity has created the need to develop methods of intensive cultivation that combine high yields with biodiversity conservation. One promising method in maize cultivation is intercropping with beans. The objective of this study was to determine whether maize-bean intercropping could increase insect biodiversity. We examined the activity density, species richness and Shannon diversity of bees and carabid beetles in pure and intercropped maize under both organic and conventional management. We collected carabid beetles using pitfall traps and bees by doing transect walks. The study was carried out in an agricultural landscape, on a set of 17 study sites. We found that intercropping leads to significant increases in bumblebee and honeybee activity as well as in bee species richness. Differences between pure and intercropped maize were dependent on the year of data acquisition and the management style. Solitary wild bee species activity was not significantly affected. Carabid activity density and carabid species richness also did not differ significantly between the cropping systems. We conclude that maize-bean intercropping can contribute to insect biodiversity conservation but its contribution is limited to bumblebees. Despite its relatively low contribution per hectare, maize-bean intercropping could have a surprisingly positive impact, as maize now covers large areas of German farmland. Potential exists to increase the biodiversity value of maize intercropping even further by using varied plant mixes. Our results strongly encourage further research in this direction.& nbsp;(C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH on behalf of Gesellschaft fur Okologie."

Effects of Intercropping and melon sowing date on crop growth, soil micro-environment and rhizosphere fungi and bacterial populations of maize and cassava	BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE & HORTICULTURE			English	Article							"WHITE YAM; ZEA-MAYS; YIELD; MULCH; DENSITY; COWPEA; SEASON; TIME; WEST"	The rhizosphere fungi and bacterial populations, soil micro-environment and crop growth during the late-season cropping of 2002 and 2003 in south-western Nigeria were studied by assessing the effects of melon grown in monoculture or in mixed stands with maize or cassava. Melon was sown on 28 August, 11 September and 25 September 2002, and on 20 September and 4 October 2003. Intercropping did not reduce the growth and yields of maize or cassava, but of melon irrespective of the sowing date. Melon seed yield and yield components were generally reduced by 1846 and 8-31% in mixed stands with maize and cassava, respectively. The rhizosphere fungi and bacterial populations, growth and seed yield of melon and soil moisture content were generally enhanced by early sowing compared with late sowing of melon in both cropping systems. Late sowing led to greater melon seed yield reduction than early sowing in monocropping or intercropping systems, with greater effect occurring in intercropping in both years. Number of fruits per plant, seeds per fruit and seed yield of melon were significantly reduced by 12-52, 10-75 and 10-67% by late sowing in monoculture, mixed stands with maize and mixed stands with cassava, respectively. Intercropping with melon decreased soil temperature by 3.6-10.4 degrees C and soil bulk density by 0.09-0.16 g cm(3), and increased soil moisture content by 12-45 g kg(-1) and the rhizosphere fungi and bacterial populations of maize by 10-20% and cassava by 38-46%, with early sowing showing greater effects than late sowing. Land equivalent ratios were greater than 1, irrespective of the crop combination and sowing date of melon in both years. However, increased mixture productivity of 46-55 and 69-75% in maize/melon and cassava/melon mixtures, respectively, was obtained by early sowing of melon, without a negative effect on maize grain and cassava root tuber yields. Conclusively, intercropping provided favourable soil micro-environment and increased the rhizosphere fungi and bacterial populations of maize and cassava and total crop productivity, but this depended on sowing date of melon.

In the first year the research compared the use of two hybrids of the cereal (Lorena and Luana) as control and in association with soybean varieties of different maturity group [Futura (I) and King (II)]. In the following growing season the two sowing densities of the soybean (20 vs 40 p/m2) were analyzed. In both trials the intercropping gave a production similar to that obtained from the cereals control while its protein content was significantly higher. The maturity group of soybean did not modify yield and chemical composition of the intercropping. This could have been arisen from the unfavourable climatic conditions of the first growing season. In the same trial it appeared the possibility of altering the intercropping yield and composition by choosing the maize hybrid. The suitable water availability for the cereal recorded in the second study, increased the maize yield reducing the difference in composition between pure crop and mixed forage. The sowing density of the soybean did not affect the productive response of the intercropping. Maize-soybean intercropping did not show any detrimental effect during ensiling and ensiling losses were similar to those of the maize silage.

Intercropping has the potential to improve resource use efficiency. However, prior studies of intercropping systems have generally focused on ecological, economic, and social consequences. Here, we make a comparative ecological sustainability analysis on energy capture and efficiency of maize monocropping and maize-soybean intercropping systems through emergy evaluation based on field experiments performed from 2012 to 2014. We find that maize monocropping shows higher sustainability than maize-soybean intercropping in the North China Plain at present. Quantitative results indicate that for maize monocropping, the emergy yield ratio (EYR) and emergy sustainability index (ESI) are 13.7% and 21.1% higher than that of intercropping systems, and the environmental loading ratio (ELR) is 7.3% lower than that of intercropping systems. To further test, we applied three levels of nitrogen fertilizer in intercropping systems (120 kg ha(-1), 180 kg ha(-1), 240 kg ha(-1)), and find that a reduced rate of N fertilizer for intercropped system leads to higher sustainability (ESI 5.3% higher) but still lower sustainability than maize monocropping. Key drivers of the different sustainability outcomes are decreased energy output and a larger proportion of labor input associated with intercropping systems.

Plants in intercrops grow differently from plants in single crops; however, no study has shown the association between plant plastic responses and the yield advantage. Here, we assessed the productivity of wheat-maize intercropping as compared to sole wheat and sole maize, and the associated differences in wheat shoot and leaf traits. In two field experiments, intercrop wheat and maize were both grown in alternating strips consisting of six rows of wheat and two rows of maize. The traits of wheat plants in border rows of the strips were compared to the traits of plants in the inner rows as well as those in sole wheat. Leaf development, chlorophyll concentration and azimuth, as well as the final leaf and ear sizes, tiller dynamics of wheat and yield components of both crops were determined. The relative densities of wheat and maize in the intercrop were 0.33 and 0.67, respectively, but the corresponding relative yields compared to the respective monocultures were 0.46 for wheat and 0.77 for maize. Compared to wheat plants in the inner rows of the intercrop strips as well as in the monoculture, border-row wheat plants in the intercrop strips had (a) more tillers owing to increased tiller production and survival, and thus more ears, (b) larger top leaves on the main stem and tillers, (c) higher chlorophyll concentration in leaves, (d) greater number of kernels per ear and (e) smaller thousand-grain weight. Grain yield per metre row length of border-row wheat was 141% higher than the sole wheat, and was 176% higher than the inner-row wheat. The results demonstrate the importance of plasticity in architectural traits for yield advantage in multispecies cropping systems."	"[Zhu, J.; van der Werf, W.; Vos, J.; Anten, N. P.

Although intercropping combinations and metrics have been reported, the effects of plant density on light use are not well documented. Here, we examined the light interception and use efficiency in maize-peanut intercropping with different maize plant densities in two row configurations in semiarid dryland agriculture over a two-year period. The field experiment comprised four cropping systems, i.e., monocropped maize, monocropped peanut, maize-peanut intercropping with two rows of maize and four rows of peanut, intercropping with four rows of maize and four rows of peanut, and three maize plant densities (3.0, 4.5 and 6.0 plants m(-1) row) in both monocropped and intercropping maize. The mean total light interception in intercropping across years and densities was 779 MJ.m(-2), 5.5% higher than in monocropped peanut (737 MJ.m(-2)) and 7.6% lower than in monocropped maize (843 MJ.m(-2)). Increasing maize density increased light interception in monocropped maize but did not affect the total light interception in the intercrops. Across years the LUE of maize was 2.9 g.MJ(-1) and was not affected by cropping system but increased with maize plant density. The LUE of peanut was enhanced in intercropping, especially in a wetter year. The yield advantage of maize-peanut intercropping resulted mainly from the LUE of peanut. These results will help to optimize agronomic management and system design and provide evidence for system level light use efficiency in intercropping. (C) The Author(s) 2021.

At Baiyun site the field experiment compared two P levels (0 and 53 kg P ha(-1)), two planting densities for wheat and maize, and three cropping treatments (wheat/maize intercropping, sole wheat and sole maize). The design for the wheat/soybean intercropping experiment at Jingtan site was similar, except that fertilization rates were 0 and 33 kg P ha(-1) without plant density treatment. Yield and nutrient acquisitions by intercropped wheat, maize and soybean were all significantly greater than for sole wheat, maize and soybean with the exception of K acquisition by maize. Intercropping advantages in yield (40-70% for wheat intercropped with maize and 28-30% for wheat intercropped with soybean) and in nutrient acquisition by wheat resulted from both the border- and inner-row effects. The relative contribution to increasing biomass was two-thirds from the border-row effect and one-third from the inner-row effect. Similar trends were noted for N, P and K accumulation. During the co-growth period, lasting for about 80 days from maize or soybean emergence to wheat harvesting, yield and nutrient acquisition by intercropped wheat increased significantly while those by maize or soybean intercropped with wheat decreased significantly. Aggressivities of wheat relative to either maize (0.26-1.63 of A(wm)) or soybean (0.35-0.95 of A(ws)) revealed the greater competitive ability of wheat than either maize or soybean. The nutrient competitive ratio, 1.09-7.54 for wheat relative to maize and 1.2-8.3 for wheat relative to soybean, showed that wheat had greater capability to acquire nutrients compared to soybean and maize. Comparison of overall N and K acquisition by intercropping with weighted means of those of sole cropping revealed interspecific facilitation in nutrient acquisition during co-growth.

Cereal/legume intercropping is a classical case. We carried out a global meta-analysis to assess land and fertilizer N use efficiency in intercropping of maize and soybean as compared to sole crops, based on 47 studies reported in English and 43 studies reported in Chinese. The data were extracted and analyzed with mixed effects models to assess land equivalent ratio (LER) of intercropping and factors affecting LER. The worldwide average LER of maize/soybean intercropping was 1.32 +/- 0.02, indicating a substantial land sparing potential of intercropping over sole crops. This advantage increased as the temporal niche differentiation between the two species was increased by sowing or harvesting one crop earlier than the other as in relay intercropping, i.e. with only partial overlap of the growing periods of the two species The mean fertilizer N equivalent ratio (FNER) was 1.44 +/- 0.03, indicating that intercrops received substantially less fertilizer N than sole crops for the same product output. These fertilizer savings are mainly due to the high relative maize yield and the lower N input in the intercrop compared to the input in sole maize. This meta-analysis thus shows that exploiting species complementarities by intercropping maize and soybean enables major increases in land productivity with less fertilizer N use. Both LER and FNER increased as the difference in growth duration increased for maize and soybean, but were not affected by fertilizer N rate. LER increased when soil organic matter increased but FNER did not change with soil organic matter.

We conducted a maize/peanut intercropping experiment in the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons in Shandong, China. Treatments included sole maize (SM), sole peanut (SP), and an intercrop consisting of four rows of maize and six rows of peanut (IM and IP). The results showed that the intercropping system had yield advantages based on the land equivalent ratio (LER) values of 1.15 and 1.16 in the two years, respectively. Averaged over the two years, the yield of maize in the intercropping was increased by 61.05% compared to that in SM, while the pod yield of peanut was decreased by 31.80% compared to SP. Maize was the superior competitor when intercropped with peanut, and its productivity dominated the yield of the intercropping system in our study. The increased yield was due to a higher kernel number per ear (KNE). Intercropping increased the light transmission ratio (LTR) of the ear layer in the maize canopy, the active photosynthetic duration (APD), and the harvest index (HI) compared to SM. In addition, intercropping promoted the ratio of dry matter accumulation after silking and the distribution of C-13-photosynthates to grain compared to SM. In conclusion, maize/peanut intercropping demonstrated the potential to improve the light condition of maize, achieving enhanced photosynthetic characteristics that improved female spike differentiation, reduced barrenness, and increased KNE. Moreover, dry matter accumulation and C-13-photosynthates distribution to grain of intercropped maize were improved, and a higher grain yield was ultimately obtained.

We explored the changes in soil physicochemical properties, nutrient uptake and utilization, and microbial community composition in wide-strip intercropping of maize and peanut. Results The results from three treatments, sole maize, sole peanut and intercropping of maize and peanut, showed that intercropped maize had a marginal advantage and that the nutrient content of roots, stems and grains in side-row maize was better than that in the middle row of intercropped maize and sole maize. The yield of intercropped maize was higher than that of sole cropping. The interaction between crops significantly increased soil peroxidase activity, and significantly decreased protease and dehydrogenase activities in intercropped maize and intercropped peanut. The diversity and richness of bacteria and fungi decreased in intercropped maize rhizosphere soil, whereas the richness of fungi increased intercropped peanut. RB41, Candidatus-udaeobacter, Stropharia, Fusarium and Penicillium were positively correlated with soil peroxidase activity, and negatively correlated with soil protease and dehydrogenase activities. In addition, intercropping enriched the functional diversity of the bacterial community and reduced pathogenic fungi. Conclusion Intercropping changed the composition and diversity of the bacterial and fungal communities in rhizosphere soil, enriched beneficial microbes, increased the nitrogen content of intercropped maize and provided a scientific basis for promoting intercropping in northeastern China.

In mixed stands, besides intraspecific competition for the available growth factors also interspecific competition appears. This study was conducted to characterize and quantify effects of interspecific competition on dry matter production in exemplary stands of perennials applying different static and dynamic parameters. The parameters were compared on the basis of data from field experiments conducted at two sites in south-west Germany. The experiments included perennial species of rye (Secale cereale x S. montanum), lupine (Lupinus polyphyllus) and linseed (Linum perenne) in pure stands and in two component mixtures. The relative yield total (RYT) was found to be a suitable static indicator of resource complementarity. Competitive ability was appropriately described by the competitive balance index (C-h). Regression models derived from Lotka-Volterra equations rendered a good description of dynamic growth and competition. Occasionally rye showed still an increase of dry matter at the end of the sampling period in late summer, which led to wrong estimations of competition coefficients.

Intercropping of maize (Zea mays L.) and common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) has been suggested as an alternative cropping system with environmental benefits. The aim of this study was to assess methane yield potential of mixed silages. Based on material from two field experiments at three sites in Germany, mixed silages were produced with proportions of individual components varying from 0 to 100 % of fresh matter in increments of 12.5 %. Chemical parameters (neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), crude protein (XP), starch, sugar, and crude fat) were determined, and batch tests were performed to measure methane yield potential from silages. With increasing bean proportion, concentrations of XP increased while NDF, methane yield, and methane content decreased. While methane yield showed a negative relationship with XP content (R (2) = 0.56***), a positive relation was found with NDF (R (2) = 0.55***). The reduction of methane yield of circa 1 L of methane per each additional bean percentage in the silages could not be explained by the chemical parameters of the silages. It is hypothesized that other chemical compounds, such as lectins, which were not determined in the present study, may have influenced methane production.

Intercropping maize with legumes such as lablab, Lablab purpurens (L.), is one of the effective systems to control stem borers. Sole culture maize and maize/ lablab intercrop system of different lablab densities were planted at two locations to investigate the effects of intercrop system on incidence and severity of stem borers with particular reference to Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Stem borer infestation was found to be more severe in sole culture maize than maize in maize/lablab intercrop. There was a significantly negative relationship between lablab densities and maize grain yields, suggesting a possible competition for resources between the two crops. It was concluded that density of lablab and date of planting of lablab in maize/lablab intercropping have significant affects on stem borer populations and maize grain yields.

At 117 days after planting and at a mean temperature below 10-degrees-C, monocropped lupin derived an average of 92% or 195 kg N ha-1 of its N from N2 fixation. Intercropping lupin with cereals increased (p<0.05) the percentage of N derived from atmospheric N2 (% Ndfa) to a mean of 96%. Compared to the monocropped, total N fixed per hectare in intercropped lupin declined approximately 50%, in line with the decrease in seeding rate and dry matter yield. With these high values of N2 fixation, selection of thc reference crop was not a problem; all the cereals, inter cropped or grown singly produced similar estimates of N2 fixed in lupin. It was deduced from the N-15 data that significant N transfer occurred from lupin to intercropped Italian ryegrass but not to intercropped Westerwoldian ryegrass or to oats. Doubling the N-15 fertilizer rate from 30 to 60 kg N ha-1 decreased % Ndfa to 86% (p<0.05), but total N fixed was unaltered. These results indicate that lupin has a high potential for N2 fixation at low temperatures, and can maintain higher rates of N2 fixation in soils of high N than many other forage and pasture legumes."

Therefore, a two-year field experiment was conducted with the following conditions: three maize-soybean strip intercropping patterns (SIPs), comprising two maize rows along with two, three, or four soybean rows (2M2S, 2M3S, and 2M4S, respectively); and two sole cropping patterns of maize (SM) and soybean (SS). The aim was to evaluate the biomass yield and silage quality under each condition. Our results showed that all SIPs had a land equivalent ratio (LER) of over 1.6 based on both fresh and dry matter yield, and a higher whole plant yield, compared to sole cropping. Specifically, 2M3S exhibited the highest whole crop dry matter LER (1.8-1.9) and yield (24.6-27.2 t ha(-1)) compared to SM and SS (20.88-21.49 and 3.48-4.79 t ha(-1), respectively). Maize-soybean mixed silages also showed better fermentation quality with higher lactic acid content (1-3%) and lower ammonia-N content (2-8%) compared to SS silages, and higher crude protein content (1-1.5%) with lower ammonia-N content (1-2%) compared to SM silage. Among the intercropping patterns, 2M3S had the highest fermentation quality index V-score (92-95). Consequently, maize-soybean strip intercropping improved silage quality and biomass yield, with 2M3S being recommended, due to its highest LER and biomass yield, and most optimal silage quality."

However, the traditional intercropping systems have many disadvantages including illogical field lay-out of crops, low economic value, and labor deficiency, which cannot balance the crop production and agricultural sustainability. In view of this, we developed a novel soybean strip intercropping model using maize as the partner, the regular maize-soybean strip intercropping mainly popularized in northern China and maize-soybean relay-strip intercropping principally extended in southwestern China. Compared to the traditional maize-soybean intercropping systems, the main innovation of field lay-out style in our present intercropping systems is that the distance of two adjacent maize rows are shrunk as a narrow strip, and a strip called wide strip between two adjacent narrow strips is expanded reserving for the growth of two or three rows of soybean plants. The distance between outer rows of maize and soybean strips are expanded enough for light use efficiency improvement and tractors working in the soybean strips. Importantly, optimal cultivar screening and increase of plant density achieved a high yield of both the two crops in the intercropping systems and increased land equivalent ratio as high as 2.2. Annually alternative rotation of the adjacent maize- and soybean-strips increased the grain yield of next seasonal maize, improved the absorption of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potasium of maize, while prevented the continuous cropping obstacles. Extra soybean production was obtained without affecting maize yield in our strip intercropping systems, which balanced the high crop production and agricultural sustainability.

Intercropping caused a significant (P<0.01) reduction in termite attack, reduced loss in grain yield of maize and increased the nesting of predatory ants in maize fields. In many instances, termite attack was significantly lower (P = 0.05) in the maize-soyabean intercrop than in maize intercrops with groundnuts and beans. Species of the genera Myrmicaria and Lepisiota were the dominant ant predators recorded. The study revealed that soyabean and groundnut are more effective in suppressing termite attack than common beans, suggesting the necessity to identify suitable legumes for each cropping situation. Overall, intercropping might form a component of an integrated management strategy for termites in smallholder cropping systems in East Africa. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper reports on a study that evaluated the effectiveness of maize/legume intercropping as an alternative to maize cultivation with residue burning. Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), mung bean (V. radiata), rice bean (V. umbellata), and lablab (Lablab purpureus) were sown into a standing maize crop 30 days before harvest, and the results were compared with a maize crop grown using residue burning as the method for land preparation at Pang Da Agricultural Station in Chiang Mai, Thailand, in a replicated trial conducted over 3 growing seasons from 2012 to 2014. Intercropping increased maize grain yield by 31-53% and left 70-170% more residue containing 113-230% more nitrogen than the maize sown after residue burning, depending on the legume, and decreased weed dry weight by two-thirds after 2 seasons. Soil biodiversity was enriched by the intercrops, with a doubling in the spore density of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the root-zone soil and increased abundance, diversity (Shannon index), and richness of the soil macrofauna. The abundance of soil animals increased with crop residue dry weight (r = 0.90, P < 0.05) and nitrogen content (r = 0.98, P < 0.01). The effect of intercropping on maize grain yield and accumulation of residue and nitrogen were then confirmed in a participatory experiment involving farmers in 2 highland villages in the Phrao and Chiang Dao districts of Chiang Mai Province with maize and rice bean in 2015. The effects of maize/legume intercropping-increased nitrogen accumulation and crop residue, enhanced soil biodiversity, suppression of weeds, and protection of the soil surface, which enabled the maize to be sown without land clearing with fire-should all contribute to sustainable highland maize production.

There is little experience with intercropping of food crops in Western Europe. Yields in intercrops depend on planting patterns of the mixed species in interaction with local growing conditions. Here we present data of two years field experimentation on yield and yield components of a wheat-maize intercrop system in different planting configurations in the Netherlands. Treatments included sole crops of wheat (SW) and maize (SM), a replacement intercrop consisting of strips of six wheat rows alternating with two maize rows (6:2WM), as well as subtractive or additive designs, based on skip-row (6:0WM, 0:2WM) and add-row (8:2WM, 6:3WM) configurations. The land equivalent ratio (LER) of intercrops varied from 1.18 to 1.30 in 2013 and from 0.97 to 1.08 in 2014. Wheat grown in the border rows of wheat strips had higher ear number per meter row, greater kernel number per ear, and greater yield per meter row than wheat in inner rows and sole wheat, indicating reduced competition. Wheat in the border rows in the intercrops had, however, reduced thousand kernel weight and harvest index, indicating that competition in border rows intensified over time. Intercropping negatively affected maize biomass and thousand kernel weight, especially in add-row treatments. This study indicates that there is a potential yield benefit for the wheat-maize intercropping system under Western European growing conditions. However, the LER was affected by yearly variation in weather conditions and significantly greater than one in only one of the two years of the study. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study used the N-15 stable isotope technique, under controlled laboratory conditions, to quantify the interactive effect on and relative contributions of the component species to N2O emission and mineral N dynamics in a tropical luvisol incorporated with different rates of cowpea-maize residue mixtures. The results show that increasing the maize residue proportion in the mixture significantly decreases N2O emission compared to the sole cowpea incorporation but increases mineral N concentration compared to sole maize residue incorporation. It is concluded that mixing low C:N ratio cowpea residue with high C:N ratio maize residue has potential for N management in tropical legume-cereal intercropping systems with the view to minimizing N2O emission while making N available for crop uptake.

The soybean varieties were maintained at the optimum planting density of 266,660/ha in both sole and intercrops while sole maize (TZR-EW) plots were at the recommended planting density of 53,330 plants/ha. Samsoy -2 soybean plants were taller at the various ages of growth, had more leaves and attained 50% flowering earlier, produced more and heavier nodules than TGX 1448-2E but TGX 1448-2E produced significantly (P < 0.01) more pods and higher seed yield in both seasons. Intercropping reduced the number of soybean pods per plant by 46% in the early season and seed yield by 42 and 46% in the early and late seasons, respectively. Increasing maize planting density reduced soybean seed yield by 21 and 23% at maize planting density of 44,440 and 53,330 plants/ha, respectively, compared with intercropping at 38,000 maize plants/ha. Maize plant height and leaf production were not influenced by intercropping nor by maize planting density but in the late season, maize grain yield was highest with 53,330 maize density/TGX 1448-2E but lowest with 38,000 maize density/Samsoy-2 cropping. The productivity of the intercropping system indicated yield advantage of 2-63% as depicted by the LER of 1.02-1.63 showing efficient utilization of land resource by growing the crops together and this increased with maize planting density. The total monetary return was higher for the intercrops than the sole crops with the values highest with 53,330 maize density/TGX 1448-2E in both early (N293,171.80) and late (283,069.70) seasons.

Effects of different maize hybrids on above ground biomass in intercrops with soybean	MAYDICA			English	Article						"maize; soybean; intercropping; above ground biomass; hybrids"	PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS	An (Randomized Complete Block) experiment with a maize and soybean intercropping system was set up at the experimental school of the Faculty of Agriculture-Radmilovac, Belgrade, Serbia and Montenegro. The experiment were carried out during 2002 and 2003 on the eutric cambisol soil type. Two spatial planting arrangements were applied: strip intercropping and alternate rows. Intercropping was done according to the method of replacement series and the main goal of this approach is to exchange the particular number of plants of one species with another. This examination included four experimental hybrids of maize from various FAO groups of maturity (400, 500, 600 and 700) and a soybean cultivar, ZPS-015 (maturity group O). The aim of this paper was to determine the optimal plant arrangement pattern of maize and soybean toward getting the maximum aboveground biomass with the best quality of silage. Likewise it is important to examine the advantage of late maturity maize hybrids (FAO 600 and 700) compared with medium early maturity hybrids (FAO 400 and 500). Weather had a large influence on biomass productivity. The increase of intercrop productivity in 2002 (when rainfall was adequate) was from 25-38% (strips) and 27-43% (alternate rows), while in 2003 (when rainfall was inadequate in parts of the growing season) this increase was a little bit lower: 8-18% (strips) and 13-40% (alternate rows). Intercrop variants with medium late hybrids of maize (FAO 600 and 700) gave significantly higher yield of above ground biomass in 2002. In second year of the examination 2003, the advantage was on the side of intercrop with hybrids of shorter vegetation period (FAO 400 and 500) because of drought. The greatest yield appeared in 2002 in variants of alternate rows intercrop with hybrids FAO 400 and FAO 700.

The experiment was design as randomised complete block design (RCBD) with three replicates at Sari Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources University in the north of Iran during 2010. The experimental treatments were mono-cropping of maize, white bean, bush bean, red bean, pinto bean, sword bean and intercropping of maize with bean types a 50:50 ratio. Pests and diseases infection was recorded under naturally infected in the field. The results showed that the two-spotted spider, Tetranychus urticae, population density was decreased markedly (62% and 83%, respectively) in sword bean and white bean intercropped with maize as compared to solitary treatment. The leaf miner, Delia platura, severity on bean was reduced up to 30% compared to mono-cropping treatment. In contrast, the population of thrips (Thrips tabaci) in intercropping treatments was increased up to 30% as compared to mono-cropping. Furthermore, the rust disease rate caused by Uromyces appendiculatus was reduced significantly in pinto bean or sword bean with maize (37% and 98%, respectively) compared to pinto bean and sword bean sole cropped. Shannon-Wiener and Simpson index indicates that the diversity of pests is more in intercropping than the mono-cropping by 4.5% and 1.6%, respectively. However, the degree of red bean and pinto bean pest suppression by intercropping increased as the pest community in the surrounding mono-cropping increased. It is recommended that further studies focussed on the possible time for mix sowing to controlling pest and disease.

Evidence from Ethiopia	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS-AFJARE			English	Article						"downside risk; maize; sustainable intensification; impacts; Ethiopia"	"FOOD SECURITY; MANAGEMENT; EXPOSURE"	Unexpectedly lower yield outcomes (downside risks) challenge farmers' use of external inputs that can enhance crop productivity. Using household-level panel data collected from Ethiopia, we estimated the effects of crop diversification through maize-legume intercropping/rotation on maize yield distribution and downside risk. Results from endogenous switching regression models and quintile moment approaches show that plots with maize-legume intercropping/rotation have the highest average maize yield. Such crop diversification reduces the downside risk in maize yield more when applied to plots receiving external inputs. The results imply that, in addition to the technical support around external input use in smallholder maize production, Ethiopia's agricultural extension may also need to give due emphasis to both spatial and temporal crop diversification practices. This could enhance crop productivity further and reduce the potential downside risks typically hampering smallholders' external input use in maize production.

Therefore the yield of biomass and N-fixing capacity of a winter pea (Pisum sativum L.) and crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) monocropped and intercropped with rye (Secale cereale L.) were examined for five years in a field trial. In mid-June above-ground biomass of winter crops was removed and maize transplanted. The winter crops achieved maximum dry matter yield about three to five weeks before maturity. Mixed stands yielded more biomass than pure stands and exhibited greater yield stability. The relative advantage of intercropping, expressed as land equivalent ratio (LER), determined for intercropped winter pea/rye were 1.1 to 1.2 and for crimson clover/rye 1.3. At maturity, the amount of fixed nitrogen ranged between 178 kg N for crimson clover and 242 kg N ha(-1) for winter pea, respectively. At the end of anthesis (middle of June, harvesting stage for silage fodder) 75% and 88% of the total fixed nitrogen was achieved, for clover and pea, respectively. In intercropping the amount of fixed nitrogen was lower than in pure stands due to a lower seed density of the legume; however, the N-fixing efficiency was greater than in pure stands. N-release of the winter pea in a pure stand produced a maximum yield in maize (Zea mays L.) without additional N-fertiliser. An additional N mineral fertilisation of 75 to 150 kg N and 75 to 225 kg N was necessary to achieve maximum yields in maize following intercropped winter pea and crimson clover, respectively. Legumes in mixed stands with rye resulted in lower amounts of residual nitrogen after maize harvest. The beneficial effect of legumes on maize can be divided into N-effects and rotation effects. Both effects were positive regarding winter pea. The rotation effect of crimson clover in pure stands on maize was negative. Allelopathic effects and the high sensitivity of crimson clover to mineral nitrogen in the soil, released by residues of the preceding crop, winter rape (Brassica rapa L.), were discussed as the reason for this observation. The combination of the winter pea in pure stand and maize achieved the highest total biomass yield from winter and summer crops, unfertilised (156 dt ha(-1) dry). The combinations of intercropped legumes and maize produced biomass yields of 142 to 145 dt ha(-1). Because winter pea is highly susceptible to lodging, intercropping with low seed density of rye is recommended (3/4 winter pea, 1/4 rye). The rye crop prevents lodging by providing support and high rates of N-fixation are achieved with high seed density of pea. lntercropping with crimson clover and rye should be based on high seed densities of legumes, too because rye is highly competitive within those mixtures."

However, other feedstocks or mixed feedstocks might have lower environmental impact than silage maize. The objectives of this study included: 1) to determine if forage sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L) Moench] and forage sorghum-maize intercropping can be a viable option to replace maize in forage and biogas production, and 2) to assess the environmental impact of systems involving maize and forage sorghum intercropping and comparing the impact of those, with conventional monocrop rotations. Replicated experiments were conducted in Carrington, Fargo, and Prosper, ND, in 2013 and in Fargo, ND in 2014. Maize for silage and grain and two forage sorghum cultivars (Brown Mid Rib (BMR) and non-BMR) were grown in monoculture and in intercropping. Treatments were a total of twelve; four monocultures, four inter-row intercropped maize-sorghum, and four within-row intercropped maize-sorghum. Results across environments indicated non-BMR forage sorghum monocultures produced similar or higher biomass yield compared with maize monocultures and maize-forage sorghum mixed cultures (inter-row and within row). Biogas yield and forage quality produced by forage sorghum monocultures, and mixtures containing forage sorghum were similar to that of maize. Thus, forage sorghum can replace, at least in part, silage maize as feedstock for feed or biogas. Forage sorghum and forage sorghum-maize intercropping had lower environmental impact compared with maize in all categories evaluated. In conclusion, intercropping of forage sorghum with maize is a promising alternative to maize silage for forage or as feedstock for biogas production.(C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The evaluation performed comprised the components of yield structure and those selected morphological traits of the plants, which were related with the crop yield of the plants. Each year, the samples being characteristic for pure sowing and mixed stands were taken from 30 experimental fields included in the project. The grain yields of oats grown using pure sowing and mixed stands did not differ statistically significantly The generative shoot density of mixed plants was higher if compared with the pure sowing and depended on the location of fields The oats grown using mixed stands was characterized by a more advantageous crop yield index owing to shorter straw. The panicle length did not depend on the cultivation method The number of seeds per oat panicle and the weight of 1000 grams were determined by the group effect of the methods of sowing applied and the vegetation periods. A higher number of grains in one panicle of oats grown in mixed stands was reported in 2008 and caused the weight of 1000 grains to drop The sowing method did not significantly impact the weight of a single culm, panicle, and rachis The morphological traits of the plants were strongly impacted by the vegetation seasons; consequently, this confirms the known sensitivity of oats to the course of weather conditions."

In a two-year (2019-2020) field trial, conducted in Northern Egypt, productivity of soybean and fodder maize, as well as the quality of maize herbage, were investigated under three sowing schedules; soybean and maize sown together, and maize sown 15 and 30 days after soybean, in addition to soybean and fodder maize sown in pure stands, with maize harvested at green fodder maturity (GFM), and silage maturity (SM). Harvesting fodder maize at SM resulted in higher herbage yield than harvesting it at GFM, yet it negatively affected the soybean productivity. However, this negative impact was offset when fodder maize sowing was delayed 30 days after soybean sowing. Maize harvested at GFM was characterized by a higher leaf component, which was reflected in its higher crude protein content, yet the decline in quality with advanced maturity was to a great extent, counterbalanced by the presence of high-quality ears in maize harvested at SM. This was clear in its lower fiber and higher non-fiber carbohydrate contents. Land equivalent ratio (LER) demonstrated yield advantage with the delayed sowing of fodder maize (LER > 1), while the dry matter equivalent ratio (DMER) associated the yield advantage with the late harvesting of fodder maize at SM (DMER > 1), across all sowing schedules, which was more realistic for an additive intercropping model where the dry matter is the economic component. In a soybean-fodder maize intercropping system, whether fodder maize will be cultivated for green feeding or for silage production, it is recommended that sowing is delayed until 30 days after the soybean, in order to maximize yield advantage and land use efficiency."

It was also the most common species landing on bean plants in this study during the summer of 1987. More flight activity was recorded in the monocultures than in the mixtures. More R. maidis flew at the top of the bean canopy than at the level of the corn canopy. Densely planted corn rows suppressed flight activity more than did sparsely planted rows. Plots that were planted early had lower aphid catches over the same time than did plots planted 13 and 24 days later. Aphid flight activity was negatively correlated with ground cover, corn barrier height, and corn barrier density. Aphid landing activity was not affected by planting date or corn row density but was negatively and significantly correlated with ground cover. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that ground cover was more important than barrier height and barrier density in suppressing flight and landing activity of R. maidis.

Guangtian-2). Maize was intercropped with soybean, peanut, chickpea, alfalfa, adzuki bean, garden pea, amaranth, Chinese mustard, and flowering Chinese cabbage. The results showed that most legumes substantially enhanced Cd uptake by maize under different fertiliser treatments. Cd accumulation in the leaf tissues of maize was increased by garden pea to 1.5 times the amount in the control (maize alone) with PK fertiliser. Maize intercropped with garden pea absorbed 1225gplant(-1)Cd and transferred 925.9gplant(-1)Cd to above ground tissues. Adzuki bean proved as the most valuable intercrop for enhancing Cd extraction from soil by maize owing to its relatively large maize bioconcentration factor of 5.9 and large transfer factor of 0.47 in the no fertiliser treatment. The results suggest that legumes caused a greater effect than non-legumes on Cd concentration in maize under different fertilisers; application of NPK fertiliser had positive effects on Cd level in intercropped maize."

Dwarf maize was intercropped with nonnodulating or nodulating soybean in the spacing patterns, S40same (two crops in the same row, 40 cm row width) and S20alt or S40alt (two crops in alternate rows, 20 cm or 40 cm row width, respectively). Tall maize was intercropped with nodulating soybean in S40same, S40alt and S40pair (maize in 40 cm paired rows, soybean rows 20 cm outside each maize row and 80 cm from the next set of four rows) at 0 or 60 kg N ha-1 and at population densities of 67% maize:67% soybean or 50% maize:50% soybean. Maize and soybean were also intercropped and stripcropped on a farm-scale. The only difference between intercrops arranged in the same rows versus those in alternate rows was that the average soybean protein yields were higher in S40same than in S40alt. In 1986, the S40alt maize-soybean intercrops produced higher maize yields, total biomass yields and Land Equivalent Ratios (LERs) than in S40pair, and in 1987, these responses were higher in intercrops than in stripcrops. In 1986, at 0 kg N ha-1, the soybean biomass and protein yields were lower in S40alt than in S40pair, and in 1987, these responses were lower in intercrops than in stripcrops.

Maize intercropped with cowpea was more compatible and advantageous than other legume intercropping. Various yield attributes of maize were superior under sole cropping, followed by maize+cowpea intercropping system. This combination recorded the highest maize-equivalent yield (52.94 q/ha) with 11.14% increase over sole maize. Among the fertility levels, recommended dose of fertilizers (120 : 60 : 30 kg NPK/ha) proved more economic than rest of the fertility levels in maize-legume intercropping system.	"[Suroshe, S.

In addition to sole crops of maize and beans at their recommended optimum densities, there were four intercropping systems representing all combinations of 100% or 50% of the sole crop density of each crop. Nitrogen at 0, 30, 60, 90 or 120 kg/ha was applied along the maize rows in the sole maize and the intercropping systems. The maize showed a good response to nitrogen in the sole crop and in all intercropping systems. Beans in intercropping also showed a good response as a result of the nitrogen applied to maize, an effect attributed to the poor nodulation of the crop on the acid soils. There was evidence of only slight competition from the beans on the maize at no nitrogen, but at higher levels of nitrogen the increased bean growth depressed maize yields by up to 30%. At low nitrogen levels beans were highly suppressed by the maize, but at the highest nitrogen levels bean yields approached or exceeded the yield of the sole beans. LERs were well above 1 for all intercropping systems (overall mean 1.46), indicating large yield advantages for intercropping. Contrary to most other cereal/legume studies, LERs increased with an increase in the level of nitrogen; means over the four intercropping systems were 1.27, 1.36, 1.41, 1.55 and 1.69 for the increasing levels of nitrogen. Maize being the more important crop in northern Zambia, it is reasoned that farmers are likely to assess intercropping in terms of how growing beans with maize compares with growing maize on its own. Although there was evidence of a slight decrease in maize yield due to intercropping at no nitrogen, the maize yield in intercropping with nitrogen applied was always well above the basic maize sole crop yield at no nitrogen, despite some yield loss due to competition from the beans. For any level of nitrogen used, returns to the cost of nitrogen and the overall net returns were greater from intercropping than from sole maize. It is concluded that, whatever level of nitrogen the farmer may adopt, the economics of sole maize are improved by adding a bean intercrop. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V."

Maximizing Land Equivalent Ratio and Economic Return by Intercropping Maize with Peanut under Sandy Soil in Egypt	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"Peanut; Maize; Intercropping; LER; MAI"	"ADVANTAGES; SYSTEMS; CORN"	"TWO FIELD experiments were conducted at the experimental and research station at Ismailia of the Agriculture Research Center (ARC) Egypt, during 2013 and 2014 summer seasons in sandy soil; to determine the effect of intercropping maize with peanut under maize treatments; harvesting maize for fodder, maize for grains with defoliation at 85 days from sowing maize or without defoliation and plant densities: 2, 3 and 4 plants/hill at distance of 70 cm apart on each of productivity, land equivalent ratio (LER), net return and monetary advantage index (MAI). A split plots design with three replications was used. The main plots were assigned to three maize treatments and maize plant densities were distributed in sub plots. Sprinkler irrigation system was used, ground nut was sowing on both sides of beds 120 cm but corn was growing in the middle. Maize variety SC168 and groundnut C.V. Giza. 6 were sown inboth seasons. The results showed that harvested maize plants for fodder produced the highest increment in pod yield/ha by (54.59 and 27.80%), during the first and second seasons, respectively, as compared with intercropped groundnut plants with harvested maize for grains without defoliation. Sowing maize by low plant density (24000 plants/ha) resulted in higher values of pod yield/ha (2.147 and 2.077 ton) during the first and second seasons, respectively. Groundnut plants which grown with harvested maize for fodder and low densities of adjacent two maize plants/hill (24000 plants/ha) recorded the highest values of pod yield/ha (2.482 and 2.304 ton) in both seasons. The relationship between maize plant densities and pod yield of ground nut was negative and followed the linear equation. Linear regression equation for maize plant densities suggested that increase in one unit (12000 plants) of maize plant densities lead to decreased pod yield/ha by 0.410 and 0.368 ton/ha during the first and second seasons, respectively. Maximum values of green fodder (17.46 and 17.93 ton) were obtained with 100% maize (48000 plants/ha), while, the minimum values (13.33 and 16.11 ton) were obtained in 50% maize density (24000 plants/ha) in first and second seasons, respectively. Maize harvested for grains without defoliation produced the highest grain yield/plant (154.2 and 162.6 g) and grain yield/ha (3.667 and 4.080 ton) during the first and second seasons, respectively. Maximum values of maize traits were obtained with intercropped 50% maize (24000 plants/ha). Grain yield/ha (4.46 and 4.78 ton) reached maximum values at full stand and harvested maize plants for grains without defoliation during both seasons. Maximum LER (1.64 and 1.69) were obtained when the maize harvested for fodder and peanut plants were grown under low density (24000 plants/ha) during the two seasons, respectively. Maximum net return/ha (1696.2 and 836.9 US$) were recorded when the maize harvested for grains with defoliation and peanut plants were grown under 50% of full stand of maize plants (24000 plants/ha). The highest MAI value (+830.5 and +889.3) was observed when the harvested maize plants for fodder and peanut plants were grown under 50% of full stand of maize plants (24000 plants/ha)."

We employed two years of survey data and alternative econometric models to better understand the use of individual and bundled packages of technologies and management practices in Ethiopian maize production, i.e., fertilizers, improved varieties, herbicides, pesticides, manure, intercropping, erosion control and crop rotation (the last three labeled integrated management). Although fertilizer and improved varieties were used on 85% of maize fields, with average yields of 3.4 ton/ha, large yield gaps remain. Complementary management practices improved these yields by as much as 22%, although in variable ways. Integrated management contributed to maize yield only when combined with crop protection (herbicides and/or pesticides). Combining manure with fertilizer and improved variety decreased maize yields, possibly due to manure quality and less inorganic fertilizer used on fields that received manure. Packages including crop protection increased labor productivity by 16-70%, while using integrated management decreased labor productivity by almost half. In summary, the combination of management practices did not automatically lead to increased yields, partly related to the conditions under which practices were applied, indicating the need for site-specific research and recommendations for sustainable intensification.</p>	"[Assefa, Banchayehu Tessema; Van Ittersum, Martin K.; Reidsma, Pytrik] Wageningen Univ, Plant Prod Syst, NL-6700 AK Wageningen, Netherlands; [Assefa, Banchayehu Tessema] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Chamberlin, Jordan] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, POB 1041-00621, Nairobi, Kenya"		"Assefa, BT (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Plant Prod Syst, NL-6700 AK Wageningen, Netherlands.;Assefa, BT (corresponding author), Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia."

The effects of maize and soybean single cropping, and strip intercropped maize and soybean under four different intercropping ratios of the two crops [maize (M): soybean (S): 2:2, 4:2, 4:4, and 6:6] were compared and analyzed the changes in photosynthetic performance, chlorophyll fluorescence, and yield components-Results showed that strip intercropping effectively improved the light response curve of maize and significantly reduced in soybean which improved the adaptability of functional leaves of maize to strong light. Maize intercropping had more open stomata, higher intercellular CO2 concentration and higher transpiration rate. Strip intercropping significantly improved the Fv/Fm, qP and Phi PSII value of maize leaves, and each parameter of soybean strip intercropping changed in contrast. The photosynthetic capacity of crops in different strip width was also different under intercropping. The photosynthetic capacity of maize in the strip was gradually reduced with the increase of strip width, while of soybean was gradually restored. Based on these changes in photosynthetic capacity, intercropping significantly increased the yield components of maize, and significantly decreased the yield components of soybean. As a result, the yield in maize strip was significantly higher than in single. However, the compound yield of strip intercropping was all higher than soybean single. In this study, intercropping advantage existed in different strip intercropping treatments and the compound economic output value of crops in each treatment was higher than maize and soybean single, among which maize-soybean 4:2 strip intercropping was the largest compound economic output value and the smallest was soybean single cropping.

For sustainable maize (Zea mays L.) production, implementation of IWM system aiming to reduce reliance on chemical weed control within Europe is a key priority. This IWM system includes all possible solutions, such as preventive, direct, biological, mechanical and alternative measures. A cropping system approach is essential to manage weeds, utilize genetic potential of maize genotypes and reduce yield losses due to weed competition. Long-term experiments are nowadays rare, but they are an excellent and reliable method for comparing cropping systems regarding yield and reduction of weed infestation level. In the research program implemented at the Maize Research Institute Zemun Polje in Central Serbia, the effects of different cropping measures and their interactions as a part of IWMs were studied during ten years. Maize rotations with winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Men.), combined with herbicide application, showed the best effect on weed biomass reduction, 92.1% and 92.2%, respectively. Winter wheat was a better preceding crop for maize than soybean, especially in combination with herbicides applied in recommended as well as in half of recommended rate. Intensification of soil tillage significantly reduced maize weed infestation, especially abundance of perennial species: Johnson grass (Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers.), Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.) and field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis L.). Other measures, such as type of fertilizer, maize row space and crop density, cover cropping and intercropping also affected weed biomass production in maize fields. Maize growing with reduced row spacing contributed to weed biomass reduction by 27.4%, while application of slow-release urea contributed to crop competitiveness. Weed biomass in sweet maize (Zea mays L. convar. saccharata) grown with common vetch as a cover crop was significantly reduced (48.5 g m(-2)) compared with the treatment without a cover crop (564.3 g m(-2)).

This study, conducted at an arid irrigation site in 2009 and 2010, determined water consumption and soil respiration (Rs) characteristics and their relationships to soil temperature (Ts) and above-ground dry matter (DM) accumulation for wheat/maize (W/M) intercropping compared with sole wheat and sole maize. The W/M intercropping had a co-growth period of 70-80 d, allowing the two intercropped species to complete their life cycles. Maximum DM rate for the wheat in the W/M system was significantly greater than that for sole wheat (57 vs. 51 g d(-1)), which occurred at around 72 to 77 d after sowing (DAS), whereas the maximum DM rate for the maize in the W/M system was between 31.6 and 44.9 g m(-2) d(-1), or 30 to 43% lower than that of sole maize. The ercroppedhe umulation of a thetime to reach maximum DM was 96 DAS in 2009 and 80 DAS in 2010 for sole maize, and the corresponding time for the intercropped maize was delayed by 6 to 10 d. Soil respiration and DM was a curvilinear relationship; with the increase in DM accumulation, Rs increased, reached a peak at the early flowering stage for wheat and at the silking stage for maize, and then declined. Soil respiration increased linearly with increases in soil temperature during the growth period for both sole and intercropping, suggesting that farming practices aimed at reducing soil temperature will be effective in reducing carbon emissions. Evapotranspiration during the co-growth period averaged 44.1 mm for sole wheat and 48.5 mm for the intercropped wheat and 57.0 mm for sole maize and 48.0 mm for the intercropped maize, but soil water status had little or no effect on Rs. Wheat/maize intercropping had greater grain yield with lower soil respiration over the corresponding sole plantings, and it can serve as a sustainable cropping system for arid irrigation areas."

Peanut/maize intercropping induced changes in rhizosphere and nutrient concentrations in shoots	PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						"maize; intercropping; peanut; phosphatases; rhizosphere; phytosiderophore; ferric reductase"	"IRON-DEFICIENCY CHLOROSIS; MAYS L. GENOTYPES; LUPINUS-ALBUS L; ACID-PHOSPHATASE; PHOSPHORUS UPTAKE; WHITE LUPIN; ROOT-GROWTH; REDUCTION CAPACITY; ORGANIC-ACIDS; FE-EFFICIENCY"	A greenhouse study was conducted to investigate the rhizosphere effects on iron (Fe), phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn), and manganese (Mn) nutrition in peanut plants (Arachis hypogaea L.) by intercropping them with maize (Zea mays L.). In addition, we studied the release of phytosiderophores and the ferric reductase activity of roots, pH and acid phosphatases in the rhizosphere and bulk soil, and the secretion of acid phosphatases in roots. Out-results revealed that shoot yields of peanut and maize plants were decreased by intercropping the plants, as compared to monocultured plants. Growing peanut plants in a mixture with maize, enhanced the shoot concentrations of Fe and Zn nearly 2.5-fold in peanut, while the Mn concentrations of peanut were little affected by intercropping. In the case of maize, the shoot concentrations of Fe, Zn and Mn were not significantly affected by intercropping with peanut. Intercropping also improved the shoot K concentration of peanut and maize, while it negatively affected the Ca concentration. In the intercropping of peanut/maize, the acid phosphatase activity of the rhizosphere and bulk soil and root secreted acid phosphatases were significantly higher than that of monocultured peanut and maize. In accordance, the shoot P concentrations of peanut and maize plants were much higher when they were intercropped with peanut or maize, respectively. The rhizosphere and bulk soil pH values were not clearly affected by different cropping systems. When compared to their monoculture treatments, the secretion of phytosiderophore from roots and the root ferric reducing capacity of the roots were either not affected or increased by 2-fold by the intercropping, respectively. The results indicate the importance of intercropping systems as a promising management practice to alleviate Fe deficiency stress. Intercropping also contributes to better nutrition of plants with Zn, P and K, most probably by affecting biological and chemical process in the rhizosphere. (C) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

A random block design with two replications per treatment was used. Height, number of tillers, length and thickness of the internodes and percentage of the area covered by weeds were measured after harvesting the peanut and dry maize. Sugar cane was tallest in the peanut association (330.69 vs 225.99 cm). The number of tillers per cut was also higher (6 vs 5) as well as the total number of tillers (192 vs 162) for every 100 m row. The length and thickness of the seventh internode showed higher values (13.64 and 8.37 cm) for peanut compared to 10.4 and 7.30 cm for maize. The area covered by weeds was of 16.35% in the peanut association while with maize it was of 98.96%. Weed coverage was negatively related to plantation vigour, Results indicated that a good vigour is observed in sugar cane establishment when peanut is intercropped, while adverse effects were obtained on intercropping with maize under the conditions of this experiment.

Plant density (number of plants per hectare) was 166666 for sole cowpea, 111111 for maize - cowpea inter-row, 55555 for maize-cowpea intra-row and 55555 for maize-cowpea intra-hole cropping. Applying 40 or 80 kg phosphorus (P)/ha significantly increased cowpea grain yields by 59-65% in 2003 and 44-55% in 2004. With maize, the increases in grain yield were 20-37% in 2003 and 48-55% in 2004 relative to the zero-P control. In both cropping seasons, the number of pod-bearing peduncles per plant, the number of pods per plant, the number of seeds per pod, and grain yield per cowpea plant were significantly increased with the application of exogenous P. In contrast, the number of pod-bearing peduncles per plant, the number of pods per plant, the number of seeds per pod, and the grain yield per plant were all significantly depressed by mixed culture relative to mono crop cowpea. There was also a significant interactive effect of P and cropping system on cowpea, such that, all cowpea yield components were generally lower in intercrop relative to mono crop. In all instances, the yield component of mono crop cowpea and, to some extent, inter-row cowpea, were markedly increased by the provision of 40 or 80 kg P/ha relative to the zero-P control. Intercropping maize with cowpea produced higher total yields per unit land area than the mono crop counterpart.

In maize field, metribuzin/atrazine was not found effective to control Dactyloctenium colonum, however, application of metribuzin 0.25 kg/ha as pre emergence (PE) followed by one hand weeding at 21 DAS was found most effective in controlling this weed. Metribuzin 0.25 kg/ha as PE + one hand weeding (HW) and maize + cowpea intercropping resulted in significantly lowest weed index which remained at par with atrazine as PE + one HW. However, after pooled analysis of results significantly highest grain yield (6 785 kg/ha) of maize was obtained with two HW, while highest grain yield of succeeding wheat (6 191 kg/ha) was obtained with the preceding effect of maize + cowpea. The highest pooled system productivity as maize equivalent yield (14 136 kg/ha) was obtained with maize + cowpea treatment which remained at par with application of atrazine or metribuzin as PE plus one HW. Significantly highest pooled gross ((sic) 153 864/ha), net ((sic) 101 948/ha) returns and B:C ratio (1.96) were also obtained with maize + cowpea, which remained at par with other tested weed management practices. The results indicate that inclusion of cowpea as cover crop in maize-wheat system will not only increase the profitability but also provide environment friendly option against the use of herbicides for weed management.

It has been proposed that there is a critical threshold density where herbivore pressure spreads from preferred plants to everything edible, leading to non-linear density effects on low-quality plants. We experimentally investigated whether survival of an unpalatable plant is similarly related to herbivore density in both monocultures and mixed stands. This we did by establishing monocultures of unpalatable black alder (Alnus glutinosa) and mixed stands of black alder and five more palatable tree species in enclosures, where Microtus voles were introduced and their abundances monitored. The effect of stand diversity tended to depend on vole abundance. Vole damage of tree saplings did not differ between monocultures and mixed stands, but at higher vole abundances attacks had a stronger effect on sapling survival in the monocultures. Sapling survival showed a significant drop in the monocultures at peak abundance of approximately 300 voles ha(-1). In monocultures herbivores do not have alternatives and therefore are forced to become deadlier consumers.

Field experiments were conducted during 2008-2009 under intercropping systems involving alfalfa (Medicago saliva L.), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas [L.] Lam.), peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) in maize (Zea mays L.) without any weeds control methods taken. The results demonstrate that maize vertical bar vertical bar sunflower is most effective on weed suppression and that it also has a more competitively inhibitory effect on Xanthium compared with the other patterns by evaluating the Xanthium density and dry weight under different intercropping systems with maize. Maize vertical bar vertical bar peanut, maize vertical bar vertical bar alfalfa and maize vertical bar vertical bar alfalfa potato intercrops have no apparent inhibitory effect on weeds. To further investigate the effect of maize vertical bar vertical bar sunflower on weed control, indoor pot experiments were conducted by determining the effect of extractions on germination rate (OR), root vigor, MDA (malondialdehyde), SOD (superoxide dismutase) and POD (peroxidase) content of Xanthium. The results better prove that maize vertical bar vertical bar sunflower extractions have more significant inhibitory effect on OR and young root vigor of Xanthium than maize monocrop extractions.

Walp.) were grown to examine how radiation interception and radiation-use efficiency (RUE) changed under intercropping. The work also examined whether intercropping advantage as measured by land equivalent ratio (LER) was determined by the yield of the dominated cowpea crop. In one experiment, maize plant density was varied and in another, it was held constant and 15 contrasting cowpea cultivars were used. Increased radiation interception by the intercrops prior to maize grain filling increased biomass production, particularly at the low maize density. There was, however, no intercropping advantage in RUE. Radiation-use efficiency of the combined intercrop was between that of maize and cowpea in sole cropping, the actual Value being determined by the proportion of radiation intercepted by component crops. There was a rather small yield advantage of intercropping, with LER of around 1.1 at the two higher plant densities of maize. At the low maize density of 2.2 plants m(-2), however, LER was less than 1.0 despite an increase in partial LER of cowpea. Cowpea yield and partial LER varied greatly among 15 cowpea cultivars when intercropped. There were positive but weak correlations between yield and vegetative dry matter of cowpea, and between vegetative dry matter and radiation transmitted through the maize canopy to the cowpea. Grain yield and partial LER of maize, on the other hand, were similar when intercropped with different cowpea cultivars, and hence variation in total LER reflected mostly the Variation in partial LER of cowpea. It is concluded that maize, except when planted at low densities, will dominate cowpea, and the performance of the dominated crop (cowpea) will have most influence on total LER.

A study was conducted for the investigation of the persistence, the dry matter accumulation potential and the competitive ability of perennial grain crops in different mixtures on marginal lands. Factorial field experiments were conducted at two sites with marginal environmental conditions in south-west Germany. The experiments included perennial species of rye (Secale cereale L. x S. montanum Guss.), intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium Host.), lupine (Lupinus polyphyllus Lindl.) and linseed (Linum perenne L.). In some stands white clover (Trifolium repens L.) was included as an undersown intercrop for improved nitrogen supply. Intermediate wheatgrass and lupine demonstrated the best persistence among the examined species. Rye showed a satisfactory ability to persist only when grown in mixture with legumes. Apparently the persistence of rye was influenced positively from nitrogen fixed by the legumes. Linseed showed only on one location a small ability for perennialism, while on the other location it did not persist at all. Both grass species were in most cases stronger competitors than the companion species. In various mixtures a positive effect of legumes on the growth of the grass species was evident. Therefore even using grain crop mixtures of grasses and legumes seem to be promising for marginal lands. Since species' competitive ability depends to a large extent on the site, statements about the suitability of different species for growing together in mixtures are not generally possible, but only with reference to a specific site.

J	Braconnier, S				Braconnier, S			Maize-coconut intercropping: effects of shade and root competition on maize growth and yield	AGRONOMIE			English	Article						"maize; coconut; photosynthesis; radiation; competition; shade"		Maize was grown simultaneously under artificial and under natural shade from coconut palms. Under artificial shade, the more solar radiation was intercepted, the less the maize developed and yielded. Under our experimental conditions, where photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was the only limiting factor, there was a simple linear relation between yield and PAR. Applying this relation to a maize-coconut intercropping system gave an estimated yield slightly higher than the actual harvest. This may be due to the difference between radiation interception by shading canvas and that obtained with a coconut cover, A second explanation may be root competition between the two crops. Although this competition indeed exists, it was not detected in our experiment due to the excellent soil and climatic conditions. Our experiment also showed that in maize, net assimilation response to PAR did not depend on the received light treatment. ((C) Inra/Elsevier, Paris.).

Inclusion of legumes (pea or lentil) as intercrops increased the dry-matter accumulation of maize + pea cropping system. The yield attributes, viz. length and girth of cob, number and weight of grains/cob, cobs/plant and 1,000-grain weight, were also increased by intercropping of legumes. Further pea had an edge over lentil. Respective mean maize grain yields were 46.4, 54.3 and 53.5 q/ha when maize was grown as sole and intercropped with pea or lentil. Maize responded to N application up to 200 kg/ha in sole stand and up to 150 kg N/ha when intercropped with either of legumes.

Maize-soybean intensification alternatives for the Pampas	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Soybean; Maize; Double crop; Relay crop; lntercrop; Land equivalent ratio (LER)"	"INTERCROP PRODUCTIVITY; SOIL CARBON; YIELD; WATER; SUNFLOWER; GROWTH; CROPS; RADIATION; DYNAMICS; NITROGEN"	Cultivating multiple crops as a land use alternative could increase system productivity and sustainability, providing options to soybean monoculture for the Argentinean Pampas. This study evaluates the performance of maize-soybean in double crop, relay crop and intercrop across a wide range of water supply and length of growing season in the Pampas. It also assesses the effect of maize cycle length and maize and soybean prices on these intensification alternatives. A total of 16 experiments, 6 rainfed and 10 irrigated, were conducted at four INTA Research Stations during five growing seasons. Yield ranged from 4390 to 16,862 kg ha(-1), for sole maize crops, and from 1884 to 5130 kg ha(-1), for sole soybean crops. The intensification alternatives productivity, measured as the land equivalent ratio (LER), was associated to the length of the growing season and was higher than 1.00 in 100%, 86% and 61% of the cases for maize-soybean double crop, relay crop and intercrop, respectively. Maize grain yield in double crop was similar to that of sole maize crop, whereas soybean yield in double crop was reduced compared to that of sole soybean crop due to sowing date delay. Maize and soybean grain yields under relay crop and intercrop were lower than their respective sole crops. The intercrop increased soybean yield and decreased maize yield compared with relay crop. Yield of soybean in intercrop and relay crop increased when sown with short cycle length maize hybrids. Maize and soybean sole crop yields were positively correlated (P<0.01, r = 0.82). However, a negative correlation was found between maize and soybean yields for intensification alternatives under irrigated conditions (P<0.01, r = -0.68), but not under rainfed conditions. The intercropping alternatives under rainfed conditions could reduce farm risk, due to the similar economic results with soybean sole crop, and the lack of correlation between soybean and maize yields.

In this research were assessed the effects of maize hybrids (AG 1051 and BR 205) in an intercropping with Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) and mechanical hoeing on weed control. The treatments assessed were: A - maize monocropping + two hoeings (20 and 40 days after sowing); B - maize with one hoeing at 20 days + intercropping with gliricidia sowed after hoeing; C - maize sowing intercropped with gliricidia at the time of maize sowing + hoeing at 40 days; D - maize sowing intercropped with gliricidia at the time of maize sowing without hoeing; E - monocropping maize without hoeing. In the intercroppings, gliricidia was sowed in broadcast seeding with 30 viable seeds m(-2). Maize hybrids did not differ in their effects on weed growth and grain yield. Treatments A, B and C have reduced weed growth, compared to treatments D and E. The highest grain yield was obtained with treatment A and the lowest with treatment E.

Field observations indicated that Fe deficiency chlorosis symptoms in peanut grown in monoculture were more severe and widespread compared to those of peanuts intercropped with maize. This indicated a marked improvement in the iron nutrition of peanut intercropped with maize in the field and was further studied. In experiments with rhizoboxes, roots of maize and peanut were either allowed to interact with each other or prevented from making contact by inserting a solid plate between the root systems of the two species. A field experiment for four cropping treatments were examined: peanut grown separately in monoculture, normal peanut/maize intercropping, peanut/maize intercropping with solid plates between the root systems of the two crop species and peanut/maize intercropping with 30 mu m nylon nets between the root systems. The results show that the chlorophyll and HCl-extractable Fe concentrations in young leaves of peanut in the intercropping system with unrestricted interactions of the roots of both plant species were much higher than those of peanut in monoculture. In the nylon mesh treatment, the beneficial effects of the maize extended to row 3. The improvement of Fe nutrition in the intercropping system got reduced but not diminished completely in the treatment with nylon net. It is suggested that the improvement in the Fe nutrition of peanut intercropped with maize was mainly caused by rhizosphere interactions between peanut and maize.

So far, the mechanism involved in this process has not been elucidated. In this study, we unravel the effects of phytosiderophores in improving Fe nutrition of intercropped peanuts in peanut/maize intercropping. The maize ys3 mutant, which cannot release phytosiderophores, did not improve Fe nutrition of peanut, whereas the maize ys1 mutant, which can release phytosiderophores, prevented Fe deficiency, indicating an important role of phytosiderophores in improving the Fe nutrition of intercropped peanut. Hydroponic experiments were performed to simplify the intercropping system, which revealed that phytosiderophores released by Fe-deficient wheat promoted Fe acquisition in nearby peanuts and thus improved their Fe nutrition. Moreover, the phytosiderophore deoxymugineic acid (DMA) was detected in the roots of intercropped peanuts. The yellow stripe1-like (YSL) family of genes, which are homologous to maize yellow stripe 1 (ZmYS1), were identified in peanut roots. Further characterization indicated that among five AhYSL genes, AhYSL1, which was localized in the epidermis of peanut roots, transported Fe(III)-DMA. These results imply that in alkaline soil, Fe(III)-DMA dissolved by maize might be absorbed directly by neighbouring peanuts in the peanut/maize intercropping system.

This study aimed to determine the effects of three maize (Zea mays L.) prolific hybrids (FAO 500, 600 and 700) and the spatial intercrop patterns on the above-ground biomass and grain yields of maize and soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill), on chernozem soil type at Zemun Polje, Belgrade, in 2003, 2004 and 2005. The experimental design was a complete randomized block with four replications and three treatments: 3 rows of maize and 3 rows of soybean in strips for each maize hybrid (three variants, 3 rows of maize and 3 rows of soybean in alternate rows for each hybrid (another three variants) and monocrops of both maize and soybeans. To optimize the ecological and economic benefits of maize/soybean intercrop in terms of yield, variety selection and compatibility of the component crops should be made using established agronomic management practices involving the two crops. Suitable maize varieties for maize/soybean intercrop systems are varieties that have less dense canopy. These varieties would therefore have lesser shading effect to the understory beans. However, establishment of an appropriate spatial arrangement of the component crops would be essential to alleviate negative effects especially on the less competitive crop. The intercropping system in alternate rows showed significantly higher above-ground biomass and grain yields in comparation with both the strip intercropping system and maize monocrops in 2004. Soybean gave significantly lower above-ground biomass and grain yield in intercrops than in monocrops. Maize prolific hybrid growing in intercropping with soybean as legume crop, increased productivity of cropping system, especially in favourable agroecological conditions. Maize and soybean yields reduction could have also been due to interspecific competition for resources such as nutrients and water. Moreover, performance of the currently grown varieties in the semi-arid regions depends on the amount of rainfall received during the growing season.

Thus, we evaluated the diversity, composition, and structure of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community in the roots, rhizosphere and the bulk soils of maize (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max) with no nitrogen fertilization (N0), reduced nitrogen fertilization (N1), and conventional nitrogen fertilization (N2) in a sweet maize/soybean strip intercropping system (S2B4) and in monocultures (SB or SS) during a 4.5-year period (2013-2017, for a total of 9 cropping seasons). We classified 120 operational taxonomic units based on Miseq sequencing data, including one phylum, 7 families, 7 genera, and 25 virtual species. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal colonization was lower only in the mots of soybean associated with the intercropping system (S2B4) under no fertilization (N0) than in those in other treatments. Glomus was the most predominant genus in the roots and soil in both monocultures and intercropping systems among the N0, N1, and N2 groups. Significantly higher diversity and co-occurring species were observed in the N0 group than in the N1 and N2 groups, and significant differences in the community structure were found in all treatments. Moreover, the pH, soil organic matter, available nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), and available phosphorus (AP) were the main driving forces shaping the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community in maize rhizosphere and bulk soils, whereas only the pH influenced the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community in soybean soils. In conclusion, both nitrogen application and intercropping influenced the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community composition and structure, but nitrogen application had a stronger influence than cropping pattern on the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community diversity in the maize/soybean strip intercropping systems; moreover, pH, NO3-N, and AP were the main factors driving the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community structure."

A two year study on herbicide application and legume maize intercropping was undertakenat the New Developmental Farm of the University of Agriculture Peshawar, Pakistanduring maize-mungbean growing seasons of 2014 and 2015. The experiments were laid out in a split plot design with herbicide use as factor A and intercropping as factor B. The maize crop was sown in June and harvested in September. The results revealed that the herbicide application (factor A) and the intercropping treatments (factor B) both significantly affected the weed density (m(-2)), fresh biomass of weeds, yield and yield components of mungbean. The application of herbicide improved the No. of grains pod(-1) , 1000 grains weight (g), the biological and grain yields of mungbean as compared to the no herbicide use plots; while no herbicide treatment increased weeds density m(-2) and fresh weeds biomass. In terms of intercropping, overall sole mungbean performed well as compared to the intercropping treatments. However, among the intercropping treatments, intercropping method of ten rows of mungbeancrop with sixrows of maize crop resulted in significantly higher biological and grain yields as compared to the yields in the treatment of five rows ofmungbeancrop intercropped with sixrows of maize crop. In conclusion, the application of herbicide pendimethalin1.5 kg a.i. ha(-1)is recommended for the desirable weed control in mungbean crop intercropped with maize crop in order to achieve best yields. Further, the intercropping of mungbean with maize at the combination of 10mungbean rows intercropped with 6 maize rows with a ratio of 2:1 is better for achieving good yield of mungbean crop in maize-mungbean intercropping system. For the interaction of pendimethalin application in the intercropping of mungbean with maize by sowing two mungbean rows between each two adjacent maize rows is the best choice."

N uptake mechanisms require further study to better understand how legumes affect root growth and to determine maize's absorptive capacity in maize-legume intercropping. We conducted a two-year field experiment with two N treatments (zero N (N0) and conventional N (N1)) and three planting patterns (monoculture maize (Zea mays L.) (MM), maize-soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) strip intercropping (IMS), and maize-peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) strip intercropping (IMP)). We sought to understand maize's N uptake mechanisms by investigating root growth and distribution, root uptake capacity, antioxidant enzyme activity, and the antioxidant content in different maize-legume strip intercropping systems. Our results showed that on average, the N uptake of maize was significantly greater by 52.5% in IMS and by 62.4% in IMP than that in MM. The average agronomic efficiency (AE) of maize was increased by 110.5 % in IMS and by 163.4 % in IMP, compared to MM. The apparent recovery efficiency (RE) of maize was increased by 22.3% in IMS. The roots of intercropped maize were extended into soybean and peanut stands underneath the space and even between the inter-rows of legume, resulting in significantly increased root surface area density (RSAD) and total root biomass. The root-bleeding sap intensity of maize was significantly increased by 22.7-49.3% in IMS and 37.9-66.7% in IMP, compared with the MM. The nitrate-N content of maize bleeding sap was significantly greater in IMS and IMP than in MM during the 2018 crop season. The glutathione (GSH) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities in the root significantly increased in IMS and IMP compared to MM. Strip intercropping using legumes increases maize's aboveground N uptake by promoting root growth and spatial distribution, delaying root senescence, and strengthening root uptake capacity.

BENTH; WESTERN KENYA; ARTIFICIAL INFESTATION; AGRONOMIC PERFORMANCE; RESISTANT MAIZE; STEMBORERS; NIGERIA; AFRICA; FIELD"	The parasitic purple witchweed [Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth.] is a serious constraint to maize production in sub-Saharan Africa, especially in poor soils. Various Striga spp. control measures have been developed, but these have not been assessed in an integrated system. This study was conducted to evaluate a set of promising technologies for S. hermonthica management in western Kenya. We evaluated three maize genotypes either intercropped with peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], or silverleaf desmodium [Desmodium uncinatum (Jacq.) DC] or as a sole crop at two locations under artificial S. hermonthica infestation and at three locations under natural S. hermonthica infestation between 2011 and 2013. Combined ANOVA showed significant (P<0.05) cropping system and cropping system by environment interactions for most traits measured. Grain yield was highest for maize grown in soybean rotation (3,672 kg ha(-1)) under artificial infestation and in D. uncinatum and peanut cropping systems (3,203 kg ha(-1) and 3,193 kg ha(-1)) under natural infestation. Grain yield was highest for the Striga spp.-resistant hybrid under both methods of infestation. A lower number of emerged S. hermonthica plants per square meter were recorded at 10 and 12 wk after planting on maize grown under D. uncinatum in the artificial S. hermonthica infestation. A combination of herbicide-resistant maize varieties intercropped with legumes was a more effective method for S. hermonthica control than individual-component technologies. Herbicide-resistant and Striga spp.-resistant maize integrated with legumes would help reduce the Striga spp. seedbank in the soil. Farmers should be encouraged to adopt an integrated approach to control Striga spp. for better maize yields.

Substitution was carried out by varying the row allocation for each generation, e.g., 3:1 (25%), 2:2 (50%) and 1:3 (75% substitution). Grain yield obtained from each mixed stand was not significantly different from the yield of the F, hybrid. Full substitution, however, led to significant yield reduction by 29% or 1,248 kg ha(-1). Frequency distribution analysis revealed the dynamics of grain weight per plant and other ear traits, indicating the presence of a compensatory mechanism, the expression of which was probably influenced by the microclimate. Future experiments similar to this study should include characterization of the microclimate in order to. understand the dynamics of individual plant performance in relation to grain yield.

In this study, a field experiment with typical winter wheat and spring maize strip intercropping systems was carried out in 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 seasons to investigate crop coefficient (K-c, defined as the ratio of actual crop evapotranspiration to reference crop evapotranspiration) and water-use efficiency (WUE, defined as the ratio of grain yield to total actual evapotranspiration) of intercropping systems in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain of China. Crop coefficient values of sole winter wheat varied in ranges of 0.26-0.36, 1.09-1.15 and 0.27-0.41 at initial, mid and late season in two seasons, respectively. K-c values of sole spring maize varied in 0.36-0.37, 1.18-1.19 and 0.22-0.28 at initial, mid and late season in two seasons, respectively. K-c values of winter wheat/spring maize intercropping system varied in 0.31-0.35, 1.14-1.23 at initial and middle wheat growing season, in 0.65-0.70 at wheat-maize co-growing period, and in 1.24-1.25 and 0.21-0.27 at middle and late maize growing season in two seasons, respectively. Compared to yields of spring maize and winter wheat in monoculture, total grain yield (wheat + maize) of winter wheat/spring maize intercropping system increased by 39% and 98%, respectively. Average WUE in the intercropping system was 21.72 kg ha(-1) mm(-1), which was 23% less than that of the sole maize, but 4% greater than that of the sole wheat (4%). Therefore, although winter wheat/spring maize intercropping system does not improve WUE, it may significantly raise yield, which is helpful to ensure food safety in northern China.

Both mixed and row intercropping significantly decreased incidence and severity levels of both diseases compared with sole cropping (P < 0.05). in mixed intercropping, common bacterial blight incidence levels were reduced by an average of 23% and 5% compared with sole cropping and row intercropping, respectively. Similarly, mixed intercropping reduced rust incidence levels on average by 51% and 25% relative to sole cropping and row intercropping, respectively. The cultivars also differed significantly in their susceptibility to both diseases (P < 0.05).

Here, two maize/pea intercrop layouts were studied in comparison to sole maize and sole pea with and without plastic cover on maize to reduce evaporation. Growth patterns over time and yield were determined. Profiles of soil water content over depth and across rows in the intercrop were measured at three times to quantify water extraction and its spatial and temporal distribution. Several indices were calculated to characterize the efficiency of land and water use of intercrops as compared with sole crops of maize and pea. Land equivalent ratio ranged from 1.18 to 1.47, indicating that intercropping was an effective strategy for maximizing land use efficiency. Water equivalent ratio, WER, defined to characterize the use efficiency of the water resource in intercropping, in analogy with LER, ranged from 0.87 to 1.16, and Delta WU, the relative departure of actual water use in intercropping from expected use, ranged from -13.7% to 19.8%, indicating variability in the effect of intercropping on water use efficiency. Plastic film in maize increased yield and water use efficiency, but did not significantly affect LER or WER, indicating that intercropping advantage was not affected by plastic film mulch, and the advantages of film mulch were conserved under intercropping. A cropping system of 4 rows maize with 4 rows peas, with 30 cm between maize rows and 20 cm between pea rows, was superior in yield and water use efficiency to a system with 2 rows maize and 4 rows of pea with 40 cm between maize rows and 20 cm between pea rows. It is concluded that intercropping of maize and pea enhances land use efficiency compared to growing them as sole crops. Film mulch saves water in sole crops as well as intercrops.

This study was aimed at investigating the prospects of intercropping maize (Zea mays L.) and maize-roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) mixtures with the legumes canavalia (Canavalia brasiliensis Mart. ex Benth) and mucuna (Mucuna pruriens var. utilis) for improving nutrient uptake and weed suppression. Farmer-managed experiments were established in two communities in the region during 2006 and 2007 using randomized split-plot designs. Maize monocrops and maize-roselle intercrops grown with different sources of nutrients were intercropped with both legume species, sown 4-6 weeks after maize. Neither the legumes decreased yields of maize nor roselle, whereas they caused a reduction of the weed biomass by 24-55%. Total aboveground biomass returned to the soil increased up to 36% and total N, P, and K uptake was increased on average by 52%, 24%, and 30%, respectively. Legumes acted not only as a N-fixing crop, but also as a catch crop, preventing N and K leaching. With its prostrate growth habit and adaptation to poor soil conditions, canavalia demonstrated agronomic advantages in comparison to mucuna.

J	Kolawole, GO				Kolawole, Gani Oladejo			Effect of phosphorus fertilizer application on the performance of maize/soybean intercrop in the southern Guinea savanna of Nigeria	ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article						"intercropping; land equivalent ratio; maize/soybean grain yields; N-fixation; phosphorus fertilizer"	"BIOLOGICAL NITROGEN-FIXATION; MAIZE; SYSTEMS; COWPEA; YIELD; GROUNDNUT"	Field experiments were conducted at the Teaching and Research Farm, Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso, Nigeria in 2007 and 2008 to determine the effects of phosphorus fertilizer application on performance of intercropped maize and soybean. The experiments, arranged as a split plot in a randomized complete block design, replicated four times. A cropping system with sole maize, sole soybean and maize/soybean intercrop formed the main plot treatments while P rates with 0, 15 and 30 kg P2O5 ha(-1) were the subplot treatments. For both years, neither P fertilizer application nor cropping systems had a significant effect on maize grain yield. However, soybean grain yield was significantly higher (92.3% in 2007 and 44.5% in 2008) under sole cropping than under maize/soybean intercropping. On average, N fixed by soybean increased with the increase in P rate (from 51.8% without P to 60.5% with 30 P), but there was no significant difference in N fixed by sole soybean and soybean/maize intercrop. However, the interaction effect on N fixed between cropping systems and P rates was significant (P <= 0.05). N, P and K contents in maize grain were significantly higher (> 100%) in intercropped maize than in sole maize. The cropping systems had no significant effect on post-harvest soil chemical characteristics. The land equivalent ratio was 1.52 in 2007 and 1.78 in 2008. The result shows that in utilizing legumes for N enrichment, the alleviation of P deficiency can enhance N-2-fixation by legumes. Furthermore, P replenishment in a maize/soybean intercrop may improve maize grain quality even though yield is not increased.

The intercrops included cowpea (V. unguiculata (L.) Walp.), purple haricot (L. purpureus (L.) Sweet.), chickpea (C. arietinum L.), alfalfa (M. sativa L.), teosinte (E. mexicana Schrad.), amaranth (A. paniculatus L.) and rape (B. napus L.). The results showed that most legumes substantially increased Cd uptake by maize during vegetative growth. Leaf tissue of maize grown with legumes averaged 5.05 mg kg(-1) higher Cd than that grown with nonlegumes, or 2.42 mg kg(-1) higher than the control. However, the effect of intercrops on Cd uptake by maize became small during reproductive growth. Since chickpea resulted in a relatively large maize bioconcentration factor of 2.0 and large transfer factor of 0.55, it is regarded as the most valuable intercrop for enhancing Cd extraction from soil by maize. The results suggest that intercropping might be a feasible practice in facilitating phytoremediation.	"[Li, N. Y.; Li, Z.

The objective of this study was to assess the performance of six maize genotypes under intercropping with conservation tillage (no-till) - two promising options for SI. The experiment was carried out over three years (or six cropping seasons) at Kiboko Research Station, Kenya with sole cropping and mouldboard ploughing as baseline production systems. Results showed that maize genotypes and cropping systems had a significant effect on yield, but the effect of tillage was not significant. Moreover, there was no significant interactive effects of the tested factors on maize yield. The maize genotype CKH10085 had the highest yield of 7.7 t ha(-1) under sole cropping yet it also recorded the largest yield penalty due to intercropping of 1.1 t ha(-1). On the other hand, genotype CKH10717 maintained the same average yield of 7.1 t ha(-1) in both conventional and conservation tillage systems. The commercial genotype genotype CKH10080 and CKH08051 were more stable than the other experimental genotypes under the variable growing and management conditions. These two genotypes are of intermediate maturity and drought tolerance, two critical attributes to improved maize production. Intercropping reduced maize yields due to increased competition, for example the overall yield of sole cropping was 7.1 t ha(-1) compared with 6.4 t ha(-1) under intercropping; representing an overall yield penalty of 0.7 t ha(-1). The differences in performance of maize genotypes revealed opportunities to deploy genotypes to reduce risk or maximize yield, depending on the biophysical circumstances and the production objective of the farmer."

In China, maize is one of the dominant crops and consumes a great deal of N fertilizer. A considerable proportion of farmers applied superfluous nitrogen fertilizer on maize production, which certainly causes N loss as nitrate leaching. How to reduce nitrate leaching in-situ is a research hotspot on crop production recently. To observe the effect of nitrate leaching under intercropping systems, an experiment was carried out in field with four treatments which were maize monoculture, maize intercropped with red clover, maize intercropped with sweet clover and maize intercropped with pea. Results showed that the maize intercropped with red clover did not significantly influence soil nitrate content, but implementation of intercropping sweet clover and pea in maize field reduced nitrate accumulation in 0-200 cm soil layer by 25.7% and 34.4%, respectively, because these two intercropping treatments significantly reduced soil nitrate content at 120200 cm soil depth. However, intercropping had little effect on ammonium accumulation. On the other hand, the grain yield of maize was not significantly influenced by intercropping with legume. The results implied that maize intercropped with legume benefited the environment without visible loss of yield in this case.

However, its sustainability has been questioned because it consumes much more water than sole cropped wheat or maize. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of water limitation on the yield advantage and water use of this system. Three field experiments were conducted in the Hetao Irrigation District in Inner Mongolia during the growing seasons of 2012-2014. Each experiment comprised two water applications, in which one was full irrigation and the other was a period of water limitation during the co-growth period of intercropping. The interspecific competition in wheat/maize intercropping was intensified by water stress. For water limitation applied during the wheat booting/maize V5 stage (Exp. I, second irrigation was not applied), the yield advantage of intercropped wheat (IW) over sole wheat was enhanced, whereas that of intercropped maize (IM) over sole maize was reduced compared with full irrigated treatments; for water limitation applied during the wheat jointing/maize V2 stage (Exp. II, first irrigation was not applied), the yield advantages of both IW and IM were greatly reduced; for water limitation applied during the wheat grain filling/maize V9 stage (Exp. III, third irrigation was not applied), the yield advantage of IW was slightly improved, whereas that of IM was reduced. The yield advantage of intercropping under limited irrigation was 25%, 3%, and 18% in Exps. I-III, respectively, whereas that under full irrigation ranged between 22 and 24%. Under well-watered conditions, wheat/maize intercropping used 24-29% more water than the weighted means of sole crops with the water use efficiency equivalent to sole crops. After the application of water limitation, 60 mm irrigation water was saved by intercropping every year, whereas the reduction of water use ranged from 25.1 to 70.8 mm; the changes in water use of intercropping relative to sole crops was reduced to 18-24%; the changes in water use efficiency stayed at nearly zero in Exps. I and III but decreased to a value of -13% in Exp. II. These results indicated that water limitation could be applied during wheat booting or filling stage in wheat/maize intercropping to save irrigation water in our study area. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The experiment was a split plot incorporated in randomized complete block design with four replications, where maize plant density was the main plot factor and subplot factor was the planting pattern. Sole maize flowered and reached physiological maturity later than intercropped maize, while sole cowpea flowered and matured earlier than under intercropping. Higher plant densities of 30 000 and 40 000 maize plants ha(-1) delayed flowering and maturity of both component crops in sole and intercropped arrangements. Significant differences in maize and cowpea dry matter yields were observed at all trial sites. The 1rowM: 2rowsC pattern and plant density of 30 000 plants ha(-1) with 92 000 plants ha(-1) of cowpeas was superior in maize dry matter production at all trial sites, whereas sole cowpea at 40 000 plants ha(-1) gave the highest dry matter yield than the intercrop arrangements. The results of this study show that high plant density causes stress to plants and reduces plant growth, whereas intercropping has a negative influence on cowpea plant growth.

In this study, we evaluated the increased density of intercropped maize (Zea mays L.) as a means to alleviate the inhibitory effect of soil mineral N on intercropped pea (Pisum sativum L.) and improve system performance. A field experiment was conducted in the Hexi Corridor region of northwestern China from 2012 to 2014. The experiment consisted of monoculture pea, monoculture maize, and a pea/maize strip-intercropping system. Two levels of N fertilization were evaluated in both cropping systems during the co-growth period of intercropping, i.e., 0 kg N ha(-1) (N0) and 135 kg N ha(-1) (N1), and three maize densities were evaluated with both levels of N fertilization in the intercropping system, i.e., 45,000 plants ha(-1) (D1), 52,500 plants ha(-1) (D2), and 60,000 plants ha(-1) (D3). The application of N reduced the number of nodules of intercropped pea by 135% at D1 and by 9% at D2 compared to no application of N, in all the years examined. The alleviation of the inhibitory effect of soil mineral N on the nodulation of intercropped pea (C-is) was calculated as the percentage increase in nodulation with intercropping relative to monoculture for a given level of N fertilization. With the application of N, C-is was improved by increased intercropped maize density (D3 > D2 > D1) at all stages. The internal efficiency of nitrogen (IEN) of pea was improved with intercropping and, on average, was 19% and 12% greater at D3 than at D1 and D2, respectively. These results demonstrate that increased maize density can alleviate the inhibitory effect of soil N on the nodulation of pea and sustain the productivity of maize/pea intercropping while reducing N fertilizer requirements in arid regions.

Intercropping greatly reduced nitrate accumulation in the 100-200 cm soil layers compared with maize monoculture. Nitrate accumulation under intercropping systems decreased significantly at the 140-200 cm soil depth; the accumulation varied in the order CK>CST>CMX>CHM>CGT. However, compared to the CK treatment, nitrate leaching losses during the maize growing period were reduced by 20.9-174.8 (CGT), 35.2-130.8 (CHM), 60.4-122.0 (CMX), and 30.6-82.4 kg ha(-1) (CST).

The research was planned as containing five different intercropping systems with three replications at Bilecik location. Also for control purposes, pure maize and pure soybean parcels were created within these intercropping systems. The result in this study of the main effect of increasing soybean ratio in maize and soybean intercropping systems indicated that maize forage yield per unit area improved in both growing seasons. In intercrops, crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) concentration were changed by soybean contribution, since ADF and NDF values of intercropping systems were lower than those of pure maize. An increase in CP concentration and a decrease in fiber value (ADF, NDF) in soybean get better forage quality of intercropped assessment and significantly contribute to improving forage quality with regard to energy, ADF and NDF. In addition to the land equivalent ratio higher intercrops than pure plants. The result of the study also indicated that farmers would produce more forage by intercropping MZ+70%SB pattern system than sole cropping of the plants.	[Aydemir, S.

Values of land equivalent ratio, area-time equivalent ratio, relative value total and relative net return with all the intercropping systems were greater than unity indicating advantage in yield, land-use efficiency and monetary return/unit time and space over the respective monocultures. Intercropping of maize with legumes was more advantageous compared with the non-legumes. Intercropping pea at 1:1 row ratio with maize appeared to be biologically the most efficient and economically viable system giving the highest maize grain yield (2 538 kg/ha), maize equivalent yield (3 295 kg/ha) and production efficiency (136.43%) compared with the sole crops of maize, wheat, mustard, lentil, gram and their different combinations. Mustard and wheat were found non-compatible with maize.

J	"Qiu, W; Wang, NQ; Dai, J; Wang, TQ; Zuo, YM"				"Qiu, Wei; Wang, Nanqi; Dai, Jing; Wang, Tianqi; Zuo, Yuanmei"			Physiological and molecular mechanisms of improved iron nutrition of peanut intercropping with maize	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE			Chinese	Article						"maize; peanut; intercropping; rhizosphere interaction; improved iron nutrition; resource efficient"	"DEFICIENCY STRESS; RHIZOSPHERE; TRANSPORTER; PLANTS; PRODUCTIVITY; ACQUISITION; STRATEGIES; DIVERSITY; RESPONSES; INSIGHTS"	Intercropping is one of the most important farming practices for efficient use of farmland ecosystems and sustainable yield productions. Peanut intercropped with maize could significantly reduce peanut chlorosis symptom and increase the plant iron (Fe) content and crop yield in the North China Plain. The physiological and molecular mechanisms behind this phenomenon have been extensively studied for decades. Peanut and maize have evolved two distinct mechanisms in response to Fe deficiency, known as the Strategy I and the Strategy II, respectively. The Strategy I plants take up Fe2+ through soil acidification and Fe3+ reduction, while the Strategy II plants acquire Fe via secreting mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs) to dissolve insoluble ferric Fe and to form absorbable Fe(III)-MAs complexes in the rhizosphere. At the molecular level, key genes involved in Fe acquisition have been well characterized. In the Strategy I plants, peanut ferric reductase oxidase2 (AhFRO2) and iron regulated transporter1 (AhIRT1) are responsible for the reduction of Fe(III)-chelate to Fe(II) and the uptake of Fe(II), respectively. In the Strategy II plants, MAs are synthesized from methionine and secreted by mugineic acid transporter1 (MA1). The secreted MAs solubilize Fe in the rhizosphere and the resultant Fe(III)-MAs complex is then absorbed by the yellow stripe1 (YS1) transporter in maize. As a result, the Strategy II maize is more effective at mobilizing precipitated Fe, less affected by high pH and bicarbonate levels, and having a much stronger ability to resist Fe-limitation stress in calcareous soils compared with Strategy I peanuts. However, the Fe-limitation stress in peanuts could be alleviated when intercropping with maize. At physiological and biochemical levels, the ecological advantages of rhizosphere interaction is to significantly enhance the absorption and transport of Fe by intercropped peanut roots and to validate the functions of genes involved. In particular, it has been demonstrated that the AhYSL1 gene which is expressed in the peanut root epidermal cells can specifically regulate the absorption of the Fe(III)-DMA compound. Peanuts could directly absorb Fe(III)-DMA from the rhizosphere of intercropped maize. The intercropping of maize and peanut with different Fe absorption mechanisms not only improves peanut Fe nutrition but also increases resistance of these two crops. In addition, higher accumulation of photosynthesis-related proteins in intercropped peanut leaves suggests that the intercropped peanuts have a higher photosynthetic efficiency. Moreover, stress-responsive proteins displayed elevated expression levels in both peanut and maize in a monocropping system. This suggests that intercropping contributes to resistance to stress conditions. Intercropping also enhances jasmonate signaling and weakens ethylene signaling in peanut and maize roots, which may improve ecological adaptation of the maize and peanut plants in the intercropping system. The advantage in ecology system makes maize/peanut intercropping as a typical model of bio-fortification. The nutrient benefit of the inter-rhizosphere regulatory measure can be an important technological measure for bio-fortification to improve human health and nutrition. The research on the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of maize/peanut intercropping could provide important theoretical and applied bases to understand and utilize the reciprocal effect of different plant biological characteristics and to improve rhizosphere ecological environments, crop iron nutrition and efficient utilization of resources.

Separate fertilization (fertilizer of component crops applied separately to respective rows) resulted in 8.4% higher maize grain yield than uniform fertilization (fertilizer of component crops mixed together and applied uniformly in rows irrespective of crops). Reduction in population of blackgram as-an intercrop below 100% decreased the productivity of the system. Grain yield of intercropped maize was almost similar (4.04-4.18 tonnes/ha) with blackgram yield of 0.82-0.84 tonne/ha and maize-equivalent yield of 5.88-5.96 tonnes/ha to its sole crop (4.32 tonnes/ha) when grown with 100% population (20 kg seed/ ha) and 50-100% fertilizer (20 kg N and 17.6 kg P/ha) to blackgram and component crops fertilized separately indicating that 50% fertilizer to blackgram could be saved without any significant reduction in production potential of the system. Total P uptake in maize + blackgram intercropping decreased by 16-18% in maize and 40-50% in blackgram compared with sole cropping. Maximum gain in soil-available N (32.1 kg/ha/year) was under the intercropping system with 100% population and 50% fertilizer of blackgram and in available K (47.4 kg/ha/year)with 100% population-fertilizer of blackgram. Separate fertilization to both the component crops had an edge over uniform fertilization for gain in soil-available N and K.

Three planting systems of maize (standard, pair rows and square) and four plant densities (25, 50, 75 and 100%) of maize and sweet potato were assigned in a split plot design, Planting system of maize and plant densities of component crops did not interact significantly in any measurement of intercropping systems. Although different planting systems of maize did not affect on maize grain yield but pair rows planting system of maize contributed the highest root yield (18.04t ha(-1)) of sweet potato, land advantage and economic return. In response to plant density, yield of both intercropped maize and sweet potato increased with the increase of their respective densities but sweet potato yield was more adversely affected by the increased densities of maize. Under intercropped condition, 25: 100 maize/sweet potato density provided the highest tuberous root yield (24.37 t ha(-1)) of sweet potato. Competitive ratios for maize were consistently higher than the ratios obtained for sweet potato but it was compatible in 50: 100 maize/sweet potato density. Furthermore, the highest LER (1.21), highest equivalent yields of maize (6.25 t ha(-1)) and sweet potato (33.09 t ha(-1)) and highest monetary return ( $ 625 ha(-1)) in 50: 100 maize/sweet potato density indicated that this intercropping system was most efficient and economic.

However, few studies have examined root development and water uptake in wheat/maize intercropping system under different water conditions.MethodsA two-year field experiment of sole wheat, sole maize, and intercropped wheat/maize was carried out under rainfed conditions and supplementary irrigation. Roots of wheat and maize were sampled seven times over the two growing seasons (2014-2015 and 2015-2016) using auger and monolith methods.ResultsRoot growth and distribution were promoted in intercropped wheat, while in intercropped maize roots both were suppressed. The maximum lateral extension distance of intercropped wheat under rainfed conditions varied from 40 to 50cm during the co-growth period, which was significantly (p<0.05) greater than that under supplementary irrigation conditions (25-30cm), allowing intercropped wheat to access soil water in the area between the wheat and maize strips. Meanwhile, after wheat harvest, intercropped maize roots grown under supplementary irrigation showed growth recovery mainly in a horizontal direction with maximum lateral distance of 50cm.ConclusionsIntercropping boosted the capacity of wheat roots but suppressed root growth in maize, and rainfed conditions encouraged the lateral distribution of intercropped wheat roots.

To test whether N fixed by legumes becomes available to nonfixing companion species, N fluxes between soybean and maize under no, partial, and total restriction of root contact were measured on a karst site in southwest China. N content and its transfer between soybean and maize intercrops were explored in a 2-year plot experiment, with N movement between crops monitored using N-15 isotopes. Mesh barrier (30m) and no restrictions barrier root separation increased N uptake of maize by 1.28%-3.45% and 3.2%-3.45%, respectively. N uptake by soybean with no restrictions root separation was 1.23 and 1.56 times higher than that by mesh and solid barriers, respectively. In the unrestricted root condition, N transfer from soybean to maize in no restrictions barrier was 2.34-3.02mg higher than that of mesh barrier. Therefore, it was implied that soybean/maize intercropping could improve N uptake and transfer efficiently in the karst region of southwest China.

However, the impact of different water and nitrogen levels on intercropping production, interspecific interactions between intercrops, and the recovery growth of late-maturing crops is still unclear. A two-year field experiment was conducted in Yangling, Shaanxi province, to investigate the dynamics of interspecific interactions, and the effects of interspecific interactions on crop growth and yield. The experiment consisted of three factors, including three cropping systems (wheat/maize intercropping, sole wheat, sole maize), three nitrogen (N) levels and two water applications (supplementary irrigation and rainfed). The results demonstrated that, during the co-growth period, intercropped wheat was more competitive than intercropped maize; so, intercropped wheat showed a yield advantage. Intercropping increased maize yield under irrigated conditions, and this was attributed to the full recovery growth of intercropped maize after wheat harvest. However, rainfed and nil nitrogen aggravated the interspecific competition, and water deficit under maize rows, in turn, limited the recovery growth of intercropped maize, leading to yield reduction. However, compared with sole maize, the yield of intercropped maize decreased, indicating nitrogen deficiency limited the recovery growth of intercropped maize. Among all treatments, the intercropping of medium nitrogen fertilizer with irrigation had the best yield improvement and land use advantages, the total yield of intercropping was 14.8% higher than that of sole cropping, and the land use efficiency increased 16%. These results confirmed that supplementary irrigation and optimal nitrogen application alleviated the interspecific competition, promoted the recovery growth of intercropped maize and improved the yield of wheat/maize intercropping system."

The effects of strip width and orientation on photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) distribution characteristics were therefore determined to gain a better understanding of crop productivity in maize-soybean intercropping systems. A series of intercropping experiments incorporating different strip orientations and widths were conducted. In addition, an improved radiation transmission model was used to simulate PAR interception by the maize and soybean crops. We found that more PAR was intercepted by the soybean plants than by the maize plants when the strip orientation angle increased from 0 degrees to 90 degrees in the maize-soybean intercropping systems. This result was obtained in most of the main maize production areas, including those with different latitudes. The effect of strip widths within the intercropping systems also had a significant effect on PAR interception. The relative fraction of PAR intercepted ranged from 39.4% to 86% for soybean and 105.8% to 169.3% for maize. The effect of soybean strip width on leaf PAR interception was greater than that of maize strip width. These results are not only of fundamental biological importance but they also have important implications for agriculture in terms of the optimization of production in intercropping systems.

We developed and validated a three-dimensional functional-structural plant model to simulate light capture in maize and soybean sole crops and intercrop scenarios, using species traits observed in sole crops and intercrops. The intercrop maize phenotype had 2% greater light capture than the sole crop phenotype in a pure stand. The soybean intercrop phenotype had 5-10% lower light capture than the sole crop phenotype in a pure stand. The intercrop configuration increased the light capture of maize by 29% and reduced the light capture of soybean by 42%, compared with the light capture expected from sole crops. However, intercrop configuration only marginally affected total light capture by the intercrop system (+1%). Testing of individual soybean plant traits revealed that plasticity in leaf dimensions was the main reason for differences in light capture by soybean in simulated sole crops and intercrops. The results of this study illustrate a major shift of light capture from shorter species (soybean) to the taller component (maize) in a simultaneous strip intercrop. Plastic plant traits modulate this overall effect, but only marginally.

One of the strategies adopted to address the situation and to reduce the elemental N requirements is intercropping cereals with legumes to make use of the nitrogen fixed by legumes in the system. A field experiment was conducted on the Nyankpala farm of the Savanna Agricultural Research Institute (SARI) in northern Ghana to assess the influence of date of planting mucuna (Mucuna sp.) on maize grain yield and soil N in maize-mucuna intercropping system in 1996-98. The experiment was laid out as a randomized complete block design with four replications, and comprised five treatments, viz., three dates of interplanting mucuna in maize at 6, 8, and 10 weeks after planting (WAP) maize and two cropping systems, bush fallow (BF) and sole maize (no mucuna) as the control. The results showed that mucuna interplanted at 6 and 8 WAP maize increased soil N by 30% in each case and organic matter was also raised by 38, 39, and 48% for 6, 8, and 10 WAP maize, respectively. Maize grain yields obtained after two years of interplanting mucuna was highest under 6 WAP followed by 8 WAP and the least came from 10 WAP. However, the maize grain yield obtained from 8 WAP was not significantly (P > 0.05) different from the control. The unfertilized maize grain yield under 6 WAP was superior to the yields obtained from the other treatments due to the beneficial effects of the decay of the higher mucuna biomass produced in that treatment in the previous years. Some management of mucuna biomass to ensure it does not smother the cereal crop in association, is necessary to reduce competition for light in favour of the maize crop.

Contamination of maize with fumonisins is influenced by climate, agronomic and postharvest practices. This study investigated the factors associated with the occurrence of fumonisins in maize produced in three agroecological zones of Uganda. RESULTS: All the maize samples were positive for fumonisins with levels ranging from 0.27 to 10 mg kg(-1). A positive and significant correlation (P < 0.01) was observed between fumonisin levels and agroecological zone. Maize from high altitude zone had significantly higher (P < 0.05) mean total fumonisin content (4.93 mg kg(-1)) than maize from the mid altitude-moist (4.53 mg kg(-1)) and mid altitude-dry (4.50 mg kg(-1)) zones. Five farmer practices, namely intercropping, crop rotation, delayed harvesting, drying maize on bare ground and planting treated seeds were significantly associated with fumonisin production in maize. Intercropping, delayed harvesting and drying maize on bare ground increased fumonisin contamination whereas crop rotation and planting treated seeds reduced the contamination. CONCLUSION: All maize samples obtained from the three agroecological zones were contaminated with fumonisins. The study showed that some of the farmers' practices predispose maize to fumonisin contamination. The findings are important for future studies aimed at designing strategies to control and prevent contamination of maize with fumonisins.

Results obtained by the bivariate analysis of variance showed significant differences between different proportions of components in intercropped maize and pumpkins. Regarding the land equivalent ratio (LER), two rows of pumpkins and two rows of maize (proportion 2/3:1/3) were the optimum spatial arrangement in conventional farming system, while proportion 1/3:2/3 was optimal in conservation farming system. The yield of pumpkins proportionally increased with the increase of the plant population, although the intraspecies competition of pumpkins was very pronounced in intercropping with maize. The average fruit yield of pumpkins in the first year was lower in conservation farming practices in comparison with conventional farming practices. On the other hand, situation was complete opposite with pumpkin yield in second year of investigation, while significant decrease in maize yield was observed in the plots where conservation farming practices were applied. Growing pumpkins in mixture with maize probably costs a small farmer very little more effort, than the production of a sole stand of maize. At least where the productivity of mixture is dominated by one species, as with maize in maize-pumpkins intercropping, the competitive effect of the recessive species on the dominant is small.

Changes in the competitiveness of maize (Zea mays L.) as a consequence of breeding over past decades have not been reported. The main objectives of this study were to (1) test Donald's concept of communal ideotype in maize, and (2) determine the specific changes in competitiveness of maize hybrids due to breeding. Field experiments were conducted in the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons, using a de Wit replacement series design. Three maize hybrids, ZD2 (1972), YD13 (1992) and ZD909 (2011), which differed in release dates, were used in this study. Each hybrid was grown in multiple row replacement series (0:6, 1:5, 2:4, 3:3,4:2, 5:1, and 6:0), with a total plant density of 67,500 seeds/ha. Inter-cultivar competition reduced dry matter accumulation (DMA) and grain yield per plant of the cultivars in the replacement series. In each replacement series, plant DMA, grain yield and harvest index (HI) of hybrids decreased with increasing proportion of the older hybrid. Population grain yield exhibited the same trend. Based on competitive outcome and aggressivity (AG), maize hybrids differed in their competitiveness. Breeding reduced the competitiveness of maize hybrids, which ranked ZD2 > YD13 > ZD909, but the varying characteristics of plant traits were not at all consistent with competitiveness. The competitiveness of maize hybrids decreased during the past few decades, supporting Donald's communal ideotype, which states that modern high yielding hybrids should not perform well in competition with other genotypes. Shorter plants with erectophile leaves and lower root:shoot ratios could contribute to weak competitiveness. Based on an analysis of aggressivity (AG), the AG of ZD2 relative to YD13 (AG(ZD2 -> YD13)) was 0.121, the AG of YD13 relative to ZD909 (AG(YD13) (-> ZD2) warn) was 0.091, the AG of ZD2 relative to ZD909 (AG(ZD2 -> ZD909)) was 0.153, and AG(ZD2 -> YD13) AG(YD13) (-> ZD909) not equal AG(ZD2 -> ZD909), indicating that the changes in competitiveness were not consistent with the breeding process. Our results show that the competitiveness of maize hybrids was reduced by breeding, but that variation in architectural plant traits among genotypes was not completely consistent with the changes in their competitiveness.

An experiment was conducted on Ultic Haplustalf soil at Los Banos (14-degrees 11'N, 121-degrees 15'E) to determine the effects of rhizobial inoculation and nitrogen applied at 0, 30, 60 and 90 kg ha-1 on growth and performance of intercropped maize and mungbean, and to relate nitrogen use to the yield advantage. Inoculation decreased both dry matter and grain yield of intercropped maize and mungbean. Applied N at levels above 30 kg ha-1 increased the dry matter and the grain yield of maize but reduced that of the associated mungbean. Intercropping drastically reduced the dry matter yield of mungbean but maize showed negligible reductions; the reductions were evident when the crops flowered. Inoculation increased the land equivalent ratio (LER) by increasing the partial LER of maize. Applied N at high levels also increased the partial LER of maize but this failed to increase LER due to corresponding reductions in partial LER of mungbean. Nitrogen at 30 kg ha-1 produced the highest LER (1.40). Applied N increased N uptake of maize but decreased that of mungbean. Inoculation increased the N uptake of both mungbean and maize at 48 days and onward. Large reduction in N uptake of intercropped mungbean was observed when it flowered at 33 days but maize was affected 2 weeks later at the tasseling stage. Thus, the competition for N was acute when the crops were at the reproductive stage. The LER analysis in terms of N utilization efficiency showed that N absorption efficiency of both maize and mungbean was reduced due to intercropping, and mungbean was more affected than maize. Increase in applied N caused a higher reduction in N absorption by mungbean although it increased the N absorption by maize. The change in total N absorption by maize and mungbean in intercropping over that of the sole crops together, was positive in all instances, meaning higher total N absorption in mixed stand of crops than in pure stands. The N conversion efficiency, measured as the amount of grain produced per unit of N absorbed, decreased in maize due to intercropping but increased slightly in mungbean. The absorption term contributed more to the increase in LER over unity than the conversion term."

A series of three trials were done. In the first, MSVD incidence 2 months after sowing was reduced to 14.9% and 17.4% in millet and bean intercrops compared to 29.5% in the pure maize stand. The number of male Cicadulina spp. caught on sticky pole traps was also significantly reduced relative to the control, but there was little effect on the catch of females. There was no significant yield penalty for the millet intercrop but maize yield was 49% lower in the bean intercrop treatment than in the pure stand. In the second trial, there were two millet and two bean intercrop treatments and a maize only control. Fewer male Cicadulina spp. were caught in the intercrop treatments relative to the control but MSVD incidence was reduced in one millet intercrop treatment only for which the associated maize yield penalty was 89%. In the final trial the bean intercrop was again tested but it had no effect on MSVD incidence. These experiments demonstrated that intercropping maize with bean or millet decreased vector activity and/or vector numbers. Vector catches were predominantly male, and catches of males but not females were reduced in the intercrop treatments compared with pure stands. However the lower vector catch was not consistently associated with a significant reduction in MSVD incidence, and when it was there was often an associated yield penalty in the maize due to the intercrop.

Maize fodder was cultivated alone and intercropped with cowpea at seed ratio of 85:15 and 70.30. Fodder was harvested at heading stage (at about 35% dry matter). The data indicated significant increase in biomass and crude protein production of maize intercropped with cowpea at seed ratio 70:30 followed by seed ratio 85:15 as compared to maize alone. However, no (p>0.05) difference was observed in TDN production among the three treatments. Four types of silages from, I) maize alone, II) maize and cowpea (85:15), III) maize and cowpea (70:30) and IV) maize supplemented with 2.5% urea were prepared.

It has low crude protein (CP) and is rich in fiber. Its forage quality can be improved by mixing with legumes rich in CP. Achieving a greater legume contribution to achieve higher CP over monocrops is a challenge for intercropping. Field trials were conducted with lablab (Lablab purpureus L.), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L.) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), grown with sorghum as mixed 1:1 (sorghum: legumes) and 2:2 (sorghum: legumes) rows. The sorghum plant density was 250,000 and 190,000 plants ha(-1). Periodic crop biomass, leaf area index (LAI) and light interception (LI) were measured, together with forage mixture quality at final harvest. The LAI and LI values were greater for lablab and cowpea intercrops in the 1:1 configuration. Legume forage yield contributed up to 10-12% of the total dry matter (DM). A significant improvement in legume biomass was observed for a sorghum population at 190,000 plants ha(-1) with paired rows (2:2) of either lablab or cowpea. Sorghum and total forage yields were higher in both 1:1 and 2:2 configurations with 250,000 plants ha(-1). The CP concentration of the forage mixture was 62-75 g kg(-1) DM. The acid and neutral detergent fibers and the digestibility of the forage mixture were not improved to any great extent. The results suggested that sorghum planted at normal populations with paired rows of lablab or cowpea can improve sorghum-legume intercrop productivity.	"[Umesh, M.

Thus, maize intercropped with soybean or peanut (groundnut) was tested with 1:1, 1:2, and 1:5 row proportions along with sole plantings of each crop to measure resource capture and resource-use efficiency. Results revealed that sole peanut had 60% higher maize-equivalent yield and 55% better production efficiency, followed by the 1:5 row proportion of maize-peanut, over sole maize. Intercropping increased land-use efficiency by 17-53% and land-equivalent coefficient by 0.21-0.56. The relative crowding coefficient was 39% higher with 1:2 maize-soybean, whereas the monetary advantage index was the highest (US$107) with the 1:5 maize-peanut. Nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) uptakes by maize were 42.9% and 38.2%, respectively, higher with 1:5 maize-soybean, whereas phosphorus (P) uptake was 64% higher with 1:5 maize-peanut. However, the least amounts of N, P and K were mined overall with 1:5 of maize-soybean. Soil moisture content was improved by 24% and solar radiation interception by 37.8% with soybean alone over maize alone, and these parameters increased with higher row proportions of soybean. The energy parameters also improved with the 1:5 row proportions of maize-soybean or peanut intercropping.

A field experiment with five cropping systems (wheat/maize, barley/maize intercropping, wheat, maize and barley sole cropping), two N levels (0 and 225 kg N ha(-1)) and two maize mulching treatments (with and without) were performed. Sequential harvest of subplots was performed between 7 and 10 times, and the data were fitted to a logistic growth model. Intercropping significantly increased the maximum biomass and maximum growth rates of wheat and barley, but suppressed the early and maximum growth rate of intercropped maize. Maize growth recovered after the wheat or barley was harvested. In the presence of film mulch and/or fertilization, maximum biomass of intercropped maize was close to or significantly higher than that of maize alone. Fertilization and film mulching had much stronger effects on growth of maize than on wheat and barley. Interspecific competitive dynamics regulated by fertilization and film mulching can be quantified by the logistic model, which is helpful to understand the yield advantage of intercropping. This has important implications for managing interspecific competition through agronomic practices at field.

To elucidate the characteristics of different planting patterns on crop nutrient uptake, soil chemical properties, and soil bacteria community in maize-soybean relay intercropping systems, we conducted a field experiment in 2015-2016 with single factor treatments, including monoculture maize (MM), monoculture soybean (MS), maize-soybean relay intercropping (IMS), and fallow (CK). The results showed that the N uptake of maize grain increased in IMS compared with MM. Compared with MS, the yield and uptake of N, P, and K of soybean grain were increased by 25.5, 24.4, 9.6, and 22.4% in IMS, respectively, while the N and K uptakes in soybean straw were decreased in IMS. The soil total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and soil organic matter contents were significantly higher in IMS than those of the corresponding monocultures and CK. Moreover, the soil protease, soil urease, and soil nitrate reductase activities in IMS were higher than those of the corresponding monocultures and CK. The phyla Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Actinobacteria dominated in all treatments. Shannon's index in IMS was higher than that of the corresponding monocultures and CK. The phylum Proteobacteria proportion was positively correlated with maize soil organic matter and soybean soil total nitrogen content, respectively. These results indicated that the belowground interactions increased the crop nutrient (N and P) uptake and soil bacterial community diversity, both of which contributed to improved soil nutrient management for legume-cereal relay intercropping systems.

Cowpea and maize were grown alone with 30 and 60 kg/ha of N, P and K, respectively, or intercropped with 60 kg/ha as a basal dressing. The preceding crops had a significant effect on soil nutrient changes, okra growth and yield, and N response of ol;ra. Cowpea increased the N, P and K status of the soil in both sole and mixed stands, compared with sole maize. Leaf area, pod weight and marketable pod yield of okra after sole cowpea or the maize/cowpea intercrop were all significantly higher than after sole maize. Although the application of nitrogen to succeeding okra promoted growth and increased pod yield, this was not accompanied by an increase in the pod yield of okra after sole cowpea or the maize/cowpea treatment beyond 45 kg N/ha. The beneficial effects of the preceding maize/cowpea intercrop on soil fertility, okra pod yield and amounts of N required for okra were partly due to the higher rate of basal nutrients applied as compared to the effects following sole cowpea."

Intercropping Alfalfa into Silage Maize Can Be More Profitable Than Maize Silage Followed by Spring-Seeded Alfalfa	AGRONOMY-BASEL			English	Article						"silage maize; interseeding; net returns; row spacing; forage yield; forage nutritive value"	"USE EFFICIENCY; YIELD; CORN; PLANT; SERVICES; DENSITY; QUALITY; GROWTH; BELT; SOIL"	Intercropping of silage maize (Zea mays L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is not a common practice because alfalfa generally reduces maize grain and biomass yield. The objective of this research was to evaluate the productivity and profitability of silage maize-alfalfa intercropping, with a goal to establish alfalfa and increase alfalfa productivity in the first year of production. The experiment was conducted in Fargo and Prosper, ND, USA, in 2014-2017. The design was a randomized complete block with four replicates and a split-plot arrangement. The main plot had two maize row-spacing treatments (RS), 61 and 76 cm, respectively. Treatments in the subplot were: (1) maize monoculture, (2) maize intercropped with alfalfa, (3) maize intercropped with alfalfa + prohexadione-calcium (PHX), and (4) spring-seeded alfalfa in the following year (simulating a maize-spring-seeded alfalfa crop sequence). Both alfalfa and maize were seeded the same day in May of 2014 at both locations. Prohexadione-calcium, a growth regulator to reduce internode length and avoid etiolation of alfalfa seedlings, did not improve alfalfa plant survival. Averaged across locations, RS did not have an effect on silage maize yield and alfalfa forage yield. Alfalfa established in intercropping with maize had almost double the forage yield in the following year compared with spring-seeded alfalfa following a crop of silage maize. Considering a two-year system, alfalfa intercropped with maize had higher net returns than a silage-maize followed by a spring-seeded alfalfa sequence. This system has the potential to get more growers to have alfalfa in the rotation skipping the typical low forage yield of alfalfa in the establishment year.

A study was conducted over two cropping seasons to determine the effect of intercropping maize with forage legumes on soil fertility restoration, weed biomass and maize yield. Treatments involved: four cropping systems (sole maize, maize-velvet bean, maize-silverleaf, maize-cowpeas) and four fertiliser regimes (no fertiliser, 150 kg ha(-1) of compound D fertiliser (7% N: 14% P2O5: 7% K2O) + 150 kg ha(-1) ammonium nitrate (34.5% N), 100 kg ha(-1) single super phosphate (SSP, 17.5% P2O5) and 200 kg ha(-1) SSP). Maize-velvet bean intercropping reduced weed biomass by 80% relative to sole maize and maize-silverleaf intercropping. Maize-cowpea and maize-velvet bean intercropping reduced maize grain yield by 25.9% and 64.7%, respectively, compared to sole maize and maize-silverleaf intercropping. In 2017/2018, maize-silverleaf intercropping increased resin-extractable P2O5 by 60.1% compared to other cropping systems while the three fertiliser treatments increased the levels of this nutrient by 41.9-100%. The results of this study show that intercropping maize with silverleaf has the potential to restore soil fertility and control weeds, without reducing maize grain yield.

Wilczek], greengram (Vigna radiata L.) and sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) each, and six intercropping treatments. Among two planting patterns, 100 maize:33 intercrop mix proportion proved superior for maize yield than 100:67 for all the intercrops. The productivity (3.07 tomies/ha) and sustainability yield index (0.69) were highest when 1 row of greengram was intercropped with maize (2 M:1 G). Inclusion of legumes in intercropping improved both production and rain water use efficiencies with definite yield and economic advantage. The higher land equivalent ratio (1.27) and relative crowing coefficient (20.4) values for 2 M:1 G planting pattern indicated more efficient benefits and maximum maize yield advantage. As per values of aggressivity, greengram (2 rows) proved most competitive (+/- 0.0005) while sesame (2 rows) least competitive (+/- 0.0046) to maize. Among intercrops, the competitive ratio was highest (1.42) for greengram followed by blackgram in both the planting patterns. 2 M:1 G provided 9.8% (actual yield loss=+0.098) yield gain as compared to sole cropping. In the maize+greengram planting patterns, area time equivalent ratio values indicated yield advantages in the range of 19% for 2 M: 1G and 17% for 2 M:2 G Thus, inclusion of legumes (especially greengram) in maize culture system can achieve a sustainable and economic yield advantage along with shorter system duration compared to their monocultures.

However, assessment of intercropping systems using field experiments is often limited by time and cost. In this study, the suitability of using the DeNitrification DeComposition (DNDC) model to simulate intercropping of maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L.) and its aftereffect on the succeeding wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop was tested in the North China Plain. First, the model was calibrated and corroborated to simulate crop yield and nitrogen (N) uptake based on a field experiment with a typical double cropping system. With a wheat crop in winter, the experiment included five treatments in summer: maize monoculture, soybean monoculture, intercropping of maize and soybean with no N topdressing to maize (N0), intercropping of maize and soybean with 75 kg N ha(-1) topdressing to maize (N75), and intercropping of maize and soybean with 180 kg N ha(-1) topdressing to maize (N180). All treatments had 45 kg N ha(-1) as basal fertilizer. After calibration and corroboration, DNDC was used to simulate long-term (1955 to 2012) treatment effects on yield. Results showed that DNDC could stringently capture the yield and N uptake of the intercropping system under all N management scenarios, though it tended to underestimate wheat yield and N uptake under N0 and N75. Long-term simulation results showed that N75 led to the highest maize and soybean yields per unit planting area among all treatments, increasing maize yield by 59% and soybean yield by 24%, resulting in a land utilization rate 42% higher than monoculture. The results suggest a high potential to promote soybean production by intercropping soybean with maize in the North China Plain, which will help to meet the large national demand for soybean.

Maize in monoand intercropping was grown under field conditions (regosol soil, initial Olsen-P 12.6 mg kg(-1)) with P supply of 0 and 35 kg P ha yr(-1) (P0 and P35, respectively) for 3 years. Compared with monocropping, intercropping significantly increased grain yield (by 13.9 %) and plant P-use efficiency (45.1 %), which might be attributed to increasing light interception during the post-silking period. Both sufficient P supply (P35 treatment) and increased light interception delayed leaf senescence through minimizing the degradation of chlorophyll and remobilisation of P as well as increasing the expression of ZmSee2 beta gene that influences leaf longevity. Increased light interception associated with enhanced leaf longevity increased the duration of photosynthesis, which provided assimilates not only for achieving yield potential, but also for maintaining root growth. It is suggested that sucrose translocated to roots serves as a substrate for root growth and improves P uptake to satisfy the nutrient demand of expanding shoots. This work contributed to understanding of the resource-use efficiency in intercropping as regulated by shoot-root interactions.

SHOOT: ROOT DIFFERS IN WARM SEASON C-4-CEREALS WHEN GROWN ALONE IN PURE AND MIXED STANDS UNDER LOW AND HIGH WATER LEVELS	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article							"COMPETITION; SOIL; NITRATE; RATIOS; PLANTS; WHEAT"	Shoot: root (S: R) response of three warm season C-4-cereals (grasses) viz., corn (Zea mays L., cv. Hybrid-5393 VT3), grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench, cv. Hybrid-84G62 PAT), and foxtail millets (Setaria italica, cv. German Strain R) grown in pure and mixed stands was investigated at one month interval in pot experiment at West Texas A&M University, Texas, USA during spring 2010. The results indicated that the three warm season grasses responded differently in terms of S: R when grown in pure and mixed stands under low and high water levels at different growth stages. In the mixed stands, the roots and shoot biomass accumulation in millets decreased while its S: R increased and was considered the least competitor in the mixed stands than sorghum and corn. Corn plants on the other hand with higher root and shoot biomass accumulation but lower S: R was ranked first (strong) in terms of competitiveness in the mixed stands. In contrast, grain sorghum in the mixed stands produced more root and shoot biomass while grown mixed with millets, but produced less root and shoot biomass in the corn mixed stands was therefore ranked second in terms of competitiveness (corn > grain sorghum > millets). Better understanding of root architecture of different crop species in pure and mixed stands could maximize water and nutrients uptake. Early emergence of the three crop plants had positive effects on shoot and root biomass accumulation and was considered the best criteria in crops competitiveness. We also found that decreasing water level increased root biomass which declined the S: R in all three crop plants. With advancement in crop age, increase in shoot biomass was more than root biomass, and therefore, reduction in S: R was observed. We suggests that more studies are required to assess more accurately the root biomass contribution of different crops species in pure and mixed stands to improve carbon sequestration into the soils under different environmental conditions.

Maize-common bean intercropping to optimize maize-based crop production	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article							"NITROGEN-USE EFFICIENCY; INCREASES; FIXATION; YIELDS"	Maize (Zea mays L.)-common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) intercropping is a recent practice in north-western Ethiopia and there is limited information on its productivity. A field experiment was conducted at South Achefer and Mecha in north-western Ethiopia during the 2012 and 2013 crop growing seasons to determine combinations of intercrop planting arrangement (IPA) with nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) rates for optimizing maize-common bean intercrop productivity and profitability. Treatments consisted of factorial combinations of two IPA (single row of common bean between maize rows and paired rows of common bean between paired rows of maize), two N rates (92 and 128 kg N/ha) and two P rates (20 and 40 kg P/ha). A sole crop maize with recommended fertilizer rate of 128/40 kg N/P/ha was used as a control treatment. The treatments were laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Results indicated that land equivalent ratio was more than unity, and the intercrop system was 20% more productive relative to the sole crop. Maize equivalent yields were highest for most of the intercrop treatments relative to mono-crop maize with yield advantage of 14% from single row IPA with 128/20 kg N/P/ha. Single row IPA with 128/20 kg N/P/ha and paired row IPA with 92/20 kg N/P/ha increased financial returns by 16 and 8% relative to sole crop maize, respectively. Smallholder maize-based cropping of north-western Ethiopia could be nutritionally, agronomically and financially improved through maize-common bean intercropping of single row IPA with appropriate nutrient management.

Combined control of Striga hermonthica and stemborers by maize-Desmodium spp. intercrops	CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						"intercropping; maize; Desmodium; cowpea; Striga; stemborer; control"	"WITCHWEED; GERMINATION; NITROGEN; SORGHUM; BORER; ROOT"	The African witchweed (Striga spp.) and lepidopteran stemborers are two major biotic constraints to the efficient production of maize in sub-Saharan Africa. Previous studies had shown the value of intercropping maize with Desmodium uncinatum in the control of both pests. The current study was conducted to assess the potential role of other Desmodium spp., adapted to different agro-ecologies, in combined control of both pests in Kenya. Treatments consisted of intercropped plots of a Striga hermonthica- and stemborer-susceptible maize variety and one Desmodium sp. or cowpea, with a maize monocrop plot included as a control. S. hermonthica counts and stemborer damage to maize plants were significantly reduced in maize-desmodium intercrops (by up to 99.2% and 74.7%, respectively) than in a maize monocrop and a maize-cowpea intercrop. Similarly, maize plant height and grain yields were significantly higher (by up to 103.2% and 511.1%, respectively) in maize-desmodium intercrops than in maize monocrops or maize-cowpea intercrops. These results confirmed earlier findings that intercropping maize with D. uncinatum effectively suppressed S. hermonthica and stemborer infestations in maize resulting in higher crop yields. They also demonstrate that the other Desmodium spp. assessed in the current study have similar effects as D. uncinatum, indicating comparable phytochemical and other relevant attributes in these species. Overall results indicate the suitability of the Desmodium spp. for the control of both S. hermonthica and stemborers in maize. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The effects of three spatial arrangements in the maize (Zea mays L.) - soybean (Glycine max L.) intercropping on root distribution, transpiration, water use efficiency (WUE) and grain yield were examined. Two-year field experiments were conducted using three spatial arrangements of 2 rows maize x 4 rows soybean (M2S4), 2 rows maize x 2 rows soybean (M2S2) and 4 rows maize x 2 rows soybean (M4S2), with their respective sole crops (monocrop) for comparison. The grain yield of maize in intercrops was higher than its monocrop and that of soybean in intercrops was lower than its monocrop. Except for M2S2 in 2014, there were yield advantages in intercropping due to improvement in the land use efficiency. Transpiration in maize was higher than in soybean regardless of the spatial arrangements. Transpiration of both maize and soybean was influenced by the spatial arrangements of the intercropping with M4S2 or M2S4 tending to have higher daily transpiration than monocrops and other spatial arrangements. Intercropping enhanced root length density (RLD) in both maize and soybean compared to the corresponding monocrop. RLD was higher and land equivalent ratio (LER) was lower under M2S2 than under other spatial arrangements of intercropping, WUE was higher in M4S2 than in other spatial arrangements. Intercropping was more efficient in using the environmental resources than monocropping. The M4S2 spatial arrangement in the maize-soybean intercropping could be selected because of its sustainability and greater land and water use efficiency.

Peanut/maize intercropping enhances iron (Fe) nutrition in calcareous soil. In this study, the transcriptome of peanut and maize roots was analyzed by suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) and microarray analysis separately. We constructed four SSH libraries using the cDNA of peanut roots based on two cropping patterns: monocropping and intercropping, and two growth stages: vegetative stage and reproductive stage. Lib M1, I1, M2 and I2 comprised 53, 51, 37 and 54 genes, respectively. Six and four transporters were found in the two intercropping-specific SSH libraries, which may facilitate Fe acquisition and protoplasmic homeostasis of metal ions and anions. Specifically, AhNARMP1 and MTP may play a role in boosting Fe nutrition during the vegetative stage. The expression of MYC2 was also upregulated by intercropping, while an ethylene-responsive transcription factor was downregulated during two growth periods. Microarrays indicated that homocysteine S-methyltransferase and serine acetyltransferase 1 upregulated in intercropped maize roots, which directly associated with methionine biosynthesis. It may account for the enhanced phytosiderophore released capacity in intercropping, which benefited the Fe nutrition of intercropped peanut in reproductive stage. Two aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase oxidase genes, which are related to ethylene biosynthesis, were downregulated in maize root by intercropping. Taken together with our previous proteomic work, the results indicated that intercropping enhances jasmonate signaling and weakens ethylene signaling in peanut and maize roots, which may improve ecological adaptation of the peanut plant to intercropping systems.

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"climbing bean; G x CS interaction; intercroping; maize; sole cropping"		The selection of cultivars for the predominant cropping systems of small farms in the tropics depends to a large extent on the information obtained by testing their performance across the different systems. The main objective of this experiment was to measure the genotype x cropping system (G x CS) interaction for yield and selected agronomic traits of climbing beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) grown as sole crop and intercropped with two morphologically contrasting maize (Zea mays L.) cultivars. A secondary objective was to identify the most efficient and productive bean-maize intercrop combinations. Seven climbing bean genotypes were grown as sole crop and intercropped with two maize varieties, BH 140 (Mix. 1) and Guto (Mix. 2), in a factorial arranged Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications at Bako Agricultural Research Center in western Ethiopia. Main effects due to genotype and cropping system (except days to flowering) were significant for all bean traits considered. The genotypes x cropping system interaction terms were also significant for the number of seeds per pod, 100-seed weight, harvest index and seed yield. While bean seed yield significantly correlated with the number of seeds per pod (in Mix. 1) and with harvest index (in both mixtures), positive and significant correlations occurred with the number of pods per plant and 100-seed weight under sole cropping system. The correlation between bean seed yields of Mix. 1 and Mix. 2 and between Mix. 2 and sole crop were positive and significant. No such relationship was found between Mix. 2 and sole crop. The results suggest that selection of suitable climbing bean cultivars for intercropping with maize varieties predominantly grown in the area should be made under the associated culture of the two crops. Intercropping contributed to a significant reduction in seed yield of the bean genotypes due mainly to its adverse effects on the numbers of pods per plant and seeds per pod. The index tLER(1) identified most bean-maize genotype combinations of Mix. 2 as biologically more efficient system than Mix. 1. On the other hand, tLER(2) values of more than 1.00 for all treatments of Mix. 2 demonstrated higher overall productivity of the intercrop system when the bean genotypes were grown in association with a late-maturing and high yielding maize hybrid BH 140.

Relative Crowding Coefficient values indicated that maize dominated cowpea. The magnitude of competition between maize and cowpea is related to season and nitrogen fertilizer. Based on grain yields, maize and cowpea compete for N only when it was applied but tended to derive it from different sources in the absence of applied N. Spatial arrangements designed to increase light reaching intercropped cowpea included alternate and double rows of cowpeas between maize rows. These did not, however, increase grain yields of cowpeas over those intercropped with maize in the same row.

Interactions between plants in intercropped maize and common bean	JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE			English	Article						"Maize; Zea mays L.; common bean; Phaseolus vulgaris L.; intercropping; competition; mycorrhiza"	"ZEA-MAYS-L; YIELD COMPONENTS; NITROGEN; MYCORRHIZAL; NODULATION; CULTIVARS; ROOTS; FIELD; PRODUCTIVITY; FIXATION"	"BACKGROUND: Intercropping maize (Zea mays L.) with common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) can give silage yields that are as high as with monocropped maize, but with more crude protein. Interactions between maize and common bean intercropped in the UK were assessed at a range of plant densities (maize 100 000, 75 000 and 50 000 plants ha(-1) and beans at a fixed density of 50 000 plants ha(-1)). RESULTS: In monoculture, maize yield per plant increased as planting density decreased from 100 000 to 50 000 plants ha(-1). At a density of 50 000 maize plants ha(-1), both dry weight yield per plant and shoot N concentrations of maize were greater when intercropped with 50 000 Type III (bush-type) bean plants ha-1 than in monoculture (1196.4 g plant(-1) and 167.0 g plant(-1); 21.6 g N kg(-1) dry mass and 17.4 g N kg(-1) dry mass, respectively), but intercropping Type IV (climbing) beans at this density combination had no effects on either maize plant weight or shoot N concentration. Invariably, however, the beans grown at 50 000 plants ha(-1) were adversely affected by competition with maize at all densities. Weight per plant of both Type III (bush-type) and Type IV (climbing) beans grown in competition with 50 000 maize plants ha(-1) was only about half that of when grown alone. Intercropping gave increased mycorrhizal colonization of both species, especially in unfertilized plots, and gave higher shoot N concentration in the maize. The beans had more nodules in the intercrop than in the monocrop. CONCLUSIONS: Intercropping maize with Type III common bean at 50000 plants of each species ha(-1) increases yield per miaize plant above that of monoculture maize at 50000 plants ha(-1), despite plant density being doubled. This increase is brought about by increased maize shoot N concentration. Mycorrhizal infection of both species, and bean plant nodulation, are stimulated, and N moves from the beans to the maize.

PAR of intercropped maize was higher than its monocropping while PAR of intercropped cabbage was lower than its monocropping. PAR highlighted a decline trend for intercropped maize and an increase trend for intercropped cabbage with increased rows of two crops in intercropping, respectively. Relationship between PAR and the number of intercropping rows of two crops was a negative linear function for intercropped maize and a positive logarithmic function for intercropped cabbage, respectively. Grain yield of intercropped maize declined and fresh yield of intercropped cabbage increased with intercropping rows of two crops, respectively. Relationship between yield and the number of intercropping rows of two crops was a logarithmic function, negative for intercropped maize and positive for intercropped cabbage, respectively. Generally, a positive linear function between yield and PAR in the intercropping system was developed for both intercropped maize and cabbage. M-4 parallel to C-6 is recommended for an optimum combination of this intercropping system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Therefore, the aims of the research are as follows: (1) to verify if the dual inoculation can facilitate the N uptake and N transfer in maize/soybean intercropping systems and (2) to calculate how much N will be transferred from soybean to maize. A pot experiment with different root separations [solid barrier, mesh (30 mu m) barrier and no barrier] was conducted, and the N-15 isotopic tracing method was used to calculate how much N transferred from soybean to maize inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and rhizobium in a soybean (Glycine max L.cv. Dongnong No. 42)/maize (Zea mays L.cv. Dongnong No. 48) intercropping system. Compared with the Glomus mosseae inoculation (G.m.), Rhizobium SH212 inoculation (SH212), no inoculation (NI), the dual inoculation (SH212 G.m.) increased the N uptake of soybean by 28.69, 39.58, and 93.07% in a solid barrier system. N uptake of maize inoculated with both G. mosseae and rhizobium was 1.20, 1.28, and 1.68 times more than that of G.m., SH212 and NI, respectively, in solid barrier treatments. In addition, the amount of N transferred from soybean to maize in a dual inoculation system with a mesh barrier was 7.25, 7.01, and 11.45 mg more than that of G.m., SH212 and NI and similarly, 6.40, 7.58, and 12.46 mg increased in no barrier treatments. Inoculating with both AMF and rhizobium in the soybean/maize intercropping system improved the N fixation efficiency of soybean and promoted N transfer from soybean to maize, resulting in the improvement of yield advantages of legume/non-legume intercropping.

Habitat manipulation as a method of conservation biological control which employs cover crops/hedge rows/flower strips crops in the main crop field to conserve the beneficial insect fauna like natural enemies. An experiment was conducted to study the influence of intercropping of leguminous crops in maize for the management of fall armyworm. Five treatments viz., maize + groundnut (Arachis hypogaea), maize + broad bean (Vicia faba), maize + (Desmodium sp), maize + soybean (Glycine max) and monocrop of maize were evaluated for the severity of damage caused by fall armyworm. The percent plant damage and number of live larvae per 25 plants were significantly less in the maize + Desmodium sp at 9 weeks after planting compared to the monocrop of maize. Significantly higher rates of parasitization of egg mass of fall armyworm by Trichogramma sp were recorded in the maize + broad bean compared to the monocrop of maize. The abundance of Coccinellid predators and geocorid bugs was significantly higher in maize intercropped with groundnut compared to the sole crop of maize. The results of the study indicated the definite role of maize-legume intercropping in reducing fall armyworm damage in maize.

Maize yields from rotation and intercropping systems with different legumes under conservation agriculture in contrasting agro-ecologies	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"Crop rotation; Eastern and Southern Africa; Forage; Intercropping; Monocropping"	"ZEA-MAYS L.; SUSTAINABLE INTENSIFICATION; CROP PRODUCTIVITY; SOIL PROPERTIES; GRAIN LEGUMES; TILLAGE; BENEFITS; GROWTH"	Maize (Zea mays L.) is a key food security crop in Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA). Maize yield gaps are large in the smallholder farming systems of ESA but can be closed by a combination of improved crop varieties and sustainable cropping systems. On-farm trials were conducted in five countries of ESA over a seven-year period to assess the effects of different cropping systems on maize productivity. Cropping systems tested were conventional practice (Conv_sole) compared with variants of conservation agriculture (CA) such as sole maize (CA_sole), intercropping (CA_intercropping) and rotation (CA_rotation). Maize yield varied with cropping system and agroecological conditions. In highlands, CA_intercropping (3709 kg ha(-1)) outperformed Conv_sole (3456 kg ha(-1)), CA_sole (3596 kg ha(-1)) and CA_rotation (3545 kg ha(-1)) with similar legumes in the cropping system. The CA_rotation (3050 kg ha(-1)) out-yielded the other treatments (2645-2864 kg ha(-1)) in lowlands where similar legumes were grown in the cropping system. Without rotation practices, CA_sole (3596 kg ha(-1)) outperformed the conventional and CA_intercropping treatments (2954-3036 kg ha(-1)) in highlands with similar legumes in the cropping system. In lowlands, CA_intercropping (2802 kg ha(-1)) out yielded the other treatments (2485-2658 kg ha(-1)). The highest maize yield was from CA systems with groundnut (3609 kg ha(-1)) and common bean (3307-3576 kg ha(-1)) under rotation and intercropping practices, respectively. Maize-pigeon pea intercropping (35 %) and maize-groundnut rotation (31-43 %) under CA had the highest maize yield advantages over the conventional practices. The most stable maize yields were from the maize-common bean systems under CA. There is scope for promoting CA cropping systems integrated with grain and forage legumes to address maize productivity challenges on smallholder farms of ESA.

With respect to soil erosion, maize (Zea mays L.) belongs to the most problematic crops; one of the possibilities to increase protection against erosion is intercropping. In this study, we attempted to find out the effects of individual inter crops and their mixtures (sown 4-6 weeks after sowing maize) or a mixed culture (maize plus lupine) on the soil losses and surface runoff in the period 2019-2021. The study was realised in a sugar beet growing region (Haplic Luvisol); a field rainfall simulator was used. From the used variants with Lolium perenne L., Trifolium repens L., Vicia villosa Roth, Lolium multiflorum Lam., Festuca arundinacea Schreb., Triticum aestivum L. or a mixture (Vicia villosa plus a Trifolium hybrid diploid), the variants with Lolium perenne, Lolium multiflorum, Vicia villosa or Vicia villosa plus the Trifolium hybrid diploid, established between the maize rows (hybrid maize, cultivar Walterinio) on May 27, were the most efficient in case of both the soil losses and runoff reductions in the year 2019. For example, Triticum aestivum between the maize rows mostly reduced the soil losses and the surface runoff was similar (or higher) compared with the control (maize without any intercrop). The variant with Trifolium repens had mostly higher (or similar) soil loss values (compared with the control); in this variant, the runoff was lower compared with the control. We proved our hypothesis with regards to the higher reduction in the soil losses than with the runoff in the variant with Lolium perenne. The results from the years 2020 (the used variants with Lolium multiflorum, Secale cereale L., Trifolium incarnatum L., Phacelia tanacetifolia Benth., Lolium multiflorum plus Trifolium incarnatum, Lolium multiflorum plus Vicia pannonica Crantz) and 2021 (the variants with Lolium multiflorum, Lolium multiflorum early sowing, Secale cereale, Trifolium incarnatum, Phacelia tanacetifolia, Lolium multiflorum plus Trifolium incarnatum, a mixed culture = maize plus Lupinus albus L.) showed the variants with Trifolium incarnatum, the mixture (Lolium multiflorum plus Trifolium incarnatum), Phacelia tanacetifolia (in the year 2020) or the mixture (Lolium multiflorum plus Trifolium incarnatum) and a mixed culture (maize plus Lupinus albus) (2021) had the most positive effect the soil loss and surface runoff values were lower when the maize was 1 m and when the maize was 2 m with the used mixtures."

Total dry matter production and tuber yield responses to two maize populations	TROPICAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article						"sweet potato; maize; intercropping; plant population; dry matter production; tuber yield"		Six sweet potato [Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.] cultivars 'O49', 'A28/7', 'TIS 2328/6', 'C26/7', 'O2/62', and 'C9' were each grown in pure stands and with maize (Zea ma cultivar 'X304B' planted simultaneously at two populations (18 315 and 36 630 plants ha-(1)) L.) in two field trials. Cultivars 'C26/7', 'TIS 2328/6', and 'A28/7' produced less (P < 0.05) total dry matter in mixtures with maize than in pure stands, but harvest indices were not affected. Total and marketable tuber yields of 'TIS 2328/6' and 'C26/7' were also significantly (P < 0.05) lower in mixtures with maize due to the production of smaller tubers than those from pure stands. Intercropping with maize did not adversely affect tuber yield from 'O49' and 'A28/7'. Cultivar all mixtures, the joint Land Equivalent Ratio of sweet potato and maize exceeded unity, and productivity was highest in the mixture with maize planted at 18 315 plants ha(-1).

Total dry matter production and tuber yield responses to staggered maize planting dates	TROPICAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article						"sweet potato; maize; intercropping; staggered planting; dry matter production; tuber yield"		The effects of maize planting date on sweet potato growth and yield performance were examined in two seasons. Sweet potato cultivars 'O49' and 'TIS 2328/6' and maize cultivar 'X304B' were used. During the mid-dry to mid-wet season, significantly (P < 0.05) lower total dry matter (DM) and tuber yields of 'TIS 2328/6' and 'O49' were obtained from mixtures with maize planted six weeks and three weeks, respectively, before the sweet potato cultivars. Sweet potato DM production was not significantly affected in the mixtures during the mid-wet to mid-dry season and tuber yield of 'TIS 2328/6' showed no response to maize planting date while 'O49' produced significantly (P < 0.05) lower yields in mixtures with maize planted simultaneously with or after sweet potato. In both seasons intercropping adversely affected tuber number and size. Seasonal variation in responses to maize planting date were attributed to genotypic differences in tolerance to environmental stresses. The Land Equivalent Ratio was highest when maize was planted simultaneously with, or earlier than, sweet potato.

On-farm experiments were conducted to determine the effects of conservation agriculture (CA)-based maize (Zea mays L.)-legume cropping systems and conventional tillage (CT) on soil properties and yield of maize. The experiments were laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The experiments were continued for 3 yr from 2012 to 2014. The treatments were: CT with monoculture maize (CT-M), CA with monoculture maize (CA-M), CA-based maize-common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) intercropping (CA-M+CB), CA-based maize-cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) intercropping (CA-M+CP) and CA-based maize-common bean rotation (CA-M-CB).Weed infestation in CA-based maize-legume cropping systems reduced over the years. Application of CA-based maize-legume cropping systems increased soil organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus (Ava.P), and soil water infiltration rate by 37, 54, 12.3, and 327%, respectively, over CT-M. Maize grain yield increased by 54% in CA-M-CB over CT. The highest production efficiency was obtained from CA-M-CB. In conclusion, CA-M-CB followed by CA-based maize-legume intercropping were the best soil management practices as elucidated in higher soil fertility and stable yield. However, future research on CA-based cropping systems should be executed under various agro-ecologies and crop types.

Our study examined the performance of maize-soybean intercropping system at three sites across northern Mozambique. Both monocropped and intercropped maize received three levels of N application, while soybean was grown without additional fertilization. The grain yield of monocropped maize applied N at three rates and that of monocropped soybean ranged 1.6 - 2.1 t ha(-1) and 0.57 t ha(-1), respectively, in Nampula; 1.7 - 3.9 t ha(-1) and 1.87 t ha(-1), respectively, in Gurue; and 2.8 - 4.5 t and 2.01 t respectively, in Lichinga. Relative to these values, maize-soybean intercropping demonstrated advantageous productivity over monocropping in terms of the land equivalent ratio (LER) at 1.15 - 1.49 across the experimental sites. LER above 1 was mainly attributed to the consistently superior growth of intercropped maize than the monocropped maize. Under moist field conditions, the LER values were particularly high in the non-fertilized plots because maize plants became more competitive and depressed the intercropped soybean yields to greater degrees with increasing N application rates. When exposed to a dry spell, intercropped soybean showed an apparent benefit in drought avoidance, as shown by the slow depletion of the soil water potential and leaf stomatal conductance and by the retention of the aboveground biomass relative to the monocropped soybean. These results indicate that maize-soybean intercropping can be beneficial to introduce soybean while ensuring subsistent maize production in the low-N-input and drought-prone environment that prevails in the region."

Relay intercropping and mineral fertilizer effects on biomass production, maize productivity and weed dynamics in contrasting soils under conservation agriculture	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article							"LEGUME COVER CROPS; DIVERSITY; ROTATION; TILLAGE"	"Cash-constrained farmers who cannot afford herbicides and mineral fertilizers may incorporate green manure cover crops (GMCCs) as relay crops to aid in management of weeds and nitrogen in maize systems under conservation agriculture in cases where rotations are a challenge. An experiment was conducted at two sites with contrasting soil types, University of Zimbabwe farm (clay) and Domboshawa Training Centre (sandy) to investigate the effects of maize/velvet bean intercropping at 8 weeks after planting maize (WAPM), applying different fertilizer rates and exploring their interactive effects on weed composition, maize productivity and biomass production [total maize non-cob biomass (stover) plus GMCC biomass]. The performance of the system depended largely on the amount of rainfall received within and across the seasons, sites and their interaction; also on the amount of fertilizer applied. Generally, biomass yields attained by velvet bean [Mucuna pruriens L. (DC.)] were lower than reported previously. Maize grain yield and weed diversity were higher in treatments with higher fertilizer rates, reaching up to 5.1 t/ha and 1.39, respectively. Generally, the highest weed diversity and highest maize grain yield values were observed in maize/velvet bean combinations and higher fertilizer rates (i.e. 0.27 and 4.8 t/ha, respectively) in the sandy soil. Higher fertilizer rates resulted in greater maize stover yield and this contributed greatly to the biomass productivity of the system in the sandy soil in the 2012/13 season, while the high biomass productivity observed in velvet bean in the clay site in the final season contributed significantly to productivity. Maize productivity was not affected by velvet bean introduced at 8 WAPM in any of the seasons. The present study showed that relay cropping velvet bean as late as 8 WAPM and onwards has potential to increase biomass production without compromising maize yields. However, planting it as late as 8 WAPM results in reduced productivity due to reduced moisture availability."

However, the relative effects of aboveground and belowground interactions on yields of intercrops in maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] relay intercropping systems are still unclear. Field experiments, including measurements of biomass, grain yield, and photosynthetic parameters, were conducted in 2013-2014 to analyze the advantages and effects of aboveground and belowground of inter species interactions on yield. To analyze the aboveground interactions of intercrops for light interception, this study adopted three different row configurations [(Pi) 160 cm + 40 cm and (P2) 120 cm + 80 cm maize wide-narrow row planting, where two rows of soybean with a 40-cm row width were planted in the wide rows, and (P3) 100 cm +100 cm maize equal-row planting, where one row of maize and one row of soybean with a 50-cm spacing between the adjacent rows of both crops]. Moreover, to identify interspecies belowground competition, no root separation (R1) and root separation (R2) were employed between adjacent maize and soybean rows. The photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) transmittances of maize wide-row were significantly higher than those of maize narrow-row at the sixth leaf stage (jointing stage), twelfth leaf stage (bell stage), and tasseling stage. Specifically, PAR transmittances decreased as maize narrow-row spacing increased. No significant differences in the PAR transmittances of maize narrow-row or wide-row were found between the R1 and R2 conditions. Similarly, no significant differences between intercrop biomass and grain yield were observed between the R1 and R2 conditions. By contrast, different row configuration treatments exhibited significant differences in biomass (whole growth period for soybean and after tasseling stage for maize), grain yield and photosynthetic parameters of intercrops. These results implied that aboveground interactions, such as mutual shading, have more significant contributions to inter crop advantages than belowground interactions. In addition, the intercropped maize yields increased as maize narrow-row spacing (from P1 to P3 treatment) increased. However, contrasting trends were found for intercropped soybean yield and land equivalent ration (LER). No significant differences in LER were observed between R1 and R2 conditions in different row configurations. P1 treatment exhibited the maximum LER (1.64 for 2013 and 1.83 for 2014) and mixed yield (7430 kg ha(-1) for 2013 and 9559 kg ha(-1) for 2014), but the lower maize yield compared with P2 and P3 treatments. This result suggested that reducing the competitive ability of maize while increasing that of soybean significantly improves intercropping advantage in maize-soybean relay intercropping systems.

However, shading by maize decreases the photosynthetically active radiation, reaching the soybean canopy in maize/soybean relay intercropping system, which reduces soybean radiation use efficiency and competitiveness. Here, we reveal that compact maize in maize/soybean relay intercropping system enhances the photosynthetically active radiation transmittance, leaf area index, dry matter production, radiation use efficiency, and competitiveness of soybean and compensates the slight maize yield loss by substantially increasing soybean yield. In this experiment, soybean was relay intercropped with different maize types (SI, spreading maize; SII, semi-compact maize; and SIII, compact maize) in maize/soybean relay intercropping system, and all the relay intercropping treatments were compared with sole cropping systems of soybean and maize. Results revealed that SIII significantly enhanced the soybean radiation use efficiency (by 77%, from 0.35 g MJ(-1) in SI to 0.61 g MJ(-1) in SIII) and total radiation use efficiency (soybean radiation use efficiency + maize radiation use efficiency) of maize/soybean relay intercropping system (by 5%, from 3.53 g MJ(-1) in SI to 3.73 g MJ(-1) in SIII). Similarly, SIII improved the competitiveness (by 62%, from 0.58% in SI to 0.94% in SIII) of soybean but reduced the competitiveness (by 38%, from 1.73% in SI to 1.07% in SIII) of maize, which, in turn, considerably increased soybean yield by maintaining maize yield. On average, over the 2 years, in SIII, relay-intercropped soybean produced 89% of the sole soybean yield, and relay-intercropped maize produced 95% of the sole maize yield.

It is a critical farming practice for long-term productivity, agro-ecological improvement, land management, and land use. It is a well-known method to increase soil health and crop productivity. The impact of intercropping on the yield and production of maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) has been investigated at the leaf, stem, and root level. However, there is limited information about how to determine the best planting density for maize-soybean intercropping (MSI). The benefits and drawbacks of MSI are discussed in this review. Intercropping maize and soybean improves resource use, lodging resistance, and pest and weed control according to the existing research. Furthermore, soybean has low light use efficiency (LUE) and radiation use efficiency (RUE) due to the deep shade created by the maize canopy. As a result, more research is required to discover the optimal planting density to improve light and radiation efficiency.

However, intercropping can increase competition between crops and weeds. In this study, we analyzed the effects of maize-legume intercrops on the weed community in an organic cropping system. We were concerned only with competition between crops and weeds for light. We recorded a statistically significant negative correlation between the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (F-int PAR) intercepted by the canopy, and both weed density and weed dry matter. Maize-legume intercropping led to a higher soil canopy cover (leaf area index) than sole crops. The lowest values for Fint PAR were received in sole crops. Thus, in maize-legume intercrops the decrease in available light for weeds led to a reduction of weed density and dry matter, compared to sole crops. Intercropping maize and legumes considerably reduced the weed density in the intercrop compared with the maize pure stand. Weed suppression by crops was also greater on a low-productivity site than on a high-productivity site. Our results indicate that intercropping could be useful for weed suppression in organic row-crops such as maize and cotton.

Okra was either sown the same day as, or two weeks before or after maize or cowpea. Intercropping reduced the growth and yield of okra, maize and cowpea relative to their sole crops. However, okra yield was depressed more by maize than by cowpea, especially when okra was sown two weeks after maize. Comparative assessment of okra/maize and okra/cowpea mixtures suggests that it is better to grow okra and cowpea together than intercropping okra and maize because yield advantages were always higher in okra/cowpea (67% and 59% in 1990 and 1991 respectively) than in okra/maize (15% and 29%). The results were discussed in light of competitive abilities of the various components in the mixtures.

However, there is limited knowledge of aboveground and belowground interspecific interactions between maize and peanut in field. A two-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of interspecific interactions on plant growth and grain yield for a peanut/maize intercropping system under different nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) levels. The method of root separation was employed to differentiate belowground from aboveground interspecific interactions. We observed that the global interspecific interaction effect on the shoot biomass of the intercropping system decreased with the coexistence period, and belowground interaction contributed more than aboveground interaction to advantages of the intercropping in terms of shoot biomass and grain yield. There was a positive effect from aboveground and belowground interspecific interactions on crop plant growth in the intercropping system, except that aboveground interaction had a negative effect on peanut during the late coexistence period. The advantage of intercropping on grain came mainly from increased maize yield (means 95%) due to aboveground interspecific competition for light and belowground interaction (61%72% vs. 28%-39% in fertilizer treatments). There was a negative effect on grain yield from aboveground interaction for peanut, but belowground interspecific interaction positively affected peanut grain yield. The supply of N, P, or N + P increased grain yield of intercropped maize and the contribution from aboveground interspecific interaction. Our study suggests that the advantages of peanut/maize intercropping for yield mainly comes from aboveground interspecific competition for maize and belowground interspecific facilitation for peanut, and their respective yield can be enhanced by N and P. These findings are important for managing the intercropping system and optimizing the benefits from using this system. (C) 2021 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS.

EFFECT of digestates derived from the fermentation of maize-legume intercropped culture and maize monoculture application on soil properties and plant biomass production	CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						"Soil fertility; Microbial activity; Carbon; Nitrogen; Sustainable agriculture"	"SUBSTRATE-INDUCED RESPIRATION; ANAEROBIC-DIGESTION; BIOGAS PRODUCTION; MICROBIAL COMMUNITY; METHANE PRODUCTION; ENERGY-PRODUCTION; MONO-DIGESTION; CATTLE SLURRY; CURRENT STATE; NITROGEN"	"Background: The use of maize-legume mixed culture to produce renewable energy and fertilizers by anaerobic fermentation (AD), while respecting soil quality is a favourable approach in sustainable farming. This paper investigates how the substrate (silage) composition affects the quality of digestate and thus its effect on selected soil parameters (respiration, content of carbon and nitrogen). The high content of remaining nutrients (mainly N) in the AD residual biomass of digestate may increase the biomass of amended plants. One objective of this study was to determine the composition of different digestates produced by anaerobic fermentation of the biomass of intercropped (mixed) cultures. Other objectives focused the digestate impact on soil properties and yield of tested plant (lettuce) in a pot experiment, carried out under controlled conditions in the growth chamber for 6 weeks. Variants tested in the pot experiment included negative control, maize (Zea mays L.) digestate, broad bean (Vicia faba L.) digestate, white lupine (Lupinus albus L.) digestate, maize + broad bean digestate, maize + white lupine digestate. Results: As compared to maize, silage from the mixed culture (or legumes) positively affected the properties of digestate (content of N, P, K, Acid Detergent Fibre (ADF), Neutral Detergent Fibre (NDF), Acid Detergent Lignin (ADL). The effect of digestate application on soil parameters depended on the digestate composition: the highest basal respiration was induced by digestates with the increased content of dry matter and ADF - maize+ broad bean and white lupine. The broad bean variant showed glucose-induced respiration 0.75 (mu g CO2.g(-1) h(-1)), while the lowest value was in the maize variant (0.45 mu g CO2.g(-1) h(-1)). The application of digestate derived from the mixed culture increased the plant biomass more than that of single maize silage digestate (+ 14% in the maize + broad bean variant and +33% in the maize + white lupine variant). Conclusions: A potential was found of silage made of leguminous plants to increase the digestate N content. Nevertheless, it is desirable to increase the C/N ratio by raising the amount of C containing substances. Fertilization with digestate showed a potential to increase the plant biomass (compared to the unfertilized control); however, differences among the individual digestates were not observed. The benefit of legume added to the maize-based silage was proven, especially the contribution of nutrients to arable soil."

Effects of increasing maize densities in maize (Zea mays L.)/peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) intercropping on yields and other agronomic traits, and the community stability of productivity were conducted across three different experimental sites. There were significant and positive correlations between maize densities and both maize grain/biomass yields and corresponding partial land equivalent ratios (LERs) across all three locations; but grain/biomass yields and partial LERs of peanut were all negatively correlated with maize densities in each or across all locations. LERs of grain yields averaged over three locations ranged from 0.89 to 0.98, while LERs of biomass yields ranged from 0.94 to 1.09 (>1.0 except for the maize inter-plant distance of 27 cm), indicating the intercropping advantage on biomass yields but not grain yields. Peanut had significantly lower kernel harvest indexes than those in monoculture. Excessive narrowing maize inter-plant distances reduced the community stability of productivity severely (especially for maize and total LERs) and are more likely to lead to abnormal maize and peanut plants. Therefore, a rational increase of maize densities in intercropping is suggested to keep the balance between maize and peanut and the comprehensive yield advantage."

Row orientation did not significantly influence the growth and yield of spring maize. Spring maize equivalent yield and net returns recorded from various intercropping systems remained at par with north-south and east-west row orientation. Spring maize + spring groundnut intercropping system recorded significant higher growth and development parameters of spring maize and remained at par with spring maize + summer squash, sole spring maize and spring maize + maize (fodder) but significantly higher than spring maize+ spinach. Spinach recorded highest value of aggressively (0.42) and gave maximum competition to spring maize. Spring maize equivalent yield, net returns, land equivalent ratio and area time equivalent ratio were significantly higher under spring maize+ summer squash system as compared to all other systems. Spring maize + summer squash proved highly productive, profitable and viable intercropping system which gave 92.4% higher spring maize equivalent yield and (sic) 60200 ha(-1) higher net returns in comparison to sole spring maize.

Intercropping tropical vine legumes and maize for silage in temperate climates	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE			English	Article						"maize silage; intercropping; tropical forage legumes; biomass; moisture; growth rate"	"YIELD; CORN; SORGHUM; QUALITY"	Maize silage is used extensively in American dairy rations. Increasing protein content would enhance maize silage quality. This study examined nine forage legume species (Austrian winter pea. common bean, cowpea, lablab. scarlet runner bean, sesbania, sunn hemp, tropical kudzu, and velvet bean) grown in mixture with maize plants in Wisconsin, in the U.S. Plants were evaluated for growth throughout the growing season, harvest forage dry matter content, total dry matter yield. and forage mixture components. Of the forage legumes tested, common bean, lablab, scarlet runner bean, sunn hemp, and velvet bean were most successfully intercropped with maize. The common bean entry was the most aggressive forage legume, comprising 23% on a dry-matter basis of the final harvested forage mixture. The lablab entry, despite a slow start, became more productive during the late growing season and comprised 7.4% on a dry-matter basis of the final harvested forage mixture. Harvested forage moisture ranged from 299 g kg(-1) to 364 kg(-1) of dry matter. Except for the common bean mixture, which had a lower forage dry-matter yield, the mixtures did not differ from one another or the pure maize control for dry-matter accumulation per unit area. Similar to forage dry-matter yields, stover forage mixture fractions were not significantly different among entries, except for the common bean-maize mixture. Grain yields were inversely proportional to the amount of legume present.

However, few studies have investigated soil N2O emissions in intercropping systems in the North China Plain. Thus, we conducted a field experiment to compare N2O emissions under monoculture and maize-legume intercropping systems. In 2010, five treatments, including monocultured maize (M), maize-peanut (MP), maize-alfalfa (MA), maize-soybean (MS), and maize-sweet clover (MSC) intercropping were designed to investigate this issue using the static chamber technique. In 2011, M, MP, and MS remained, and monocultured peanuts (P) and soybean (S) were added to the trial. The results showed that total production of N2O from different treatments ranged from (0.87 +/- 0.12) to (1.17 +/- 0.11) kg ha(-1) in 2010, while those ranged from (3.35 +/- 0.30) to (9.10 +/- 2.09) kg ha(-1) in 2011. MA and MSC had no significant effect on soil N2O production compared to that of M (P<0.05). Cumulative N2O emissions from MP in 2010 were significantly lower than those from M, but the result was the opposite in 2011 (P<0.05). MS significantly reduced soil N2O emissions by 25.55 and 48.84% in 2010 and 2011, respectively (P<0.05). Soil N2O emissions were significantly correlated with soil water content, soil temperature, nitrification potential, soil NH4+, and soil NO3- content (R-2=0.160-0.764, P<0.01). A stepwise linear regression analysis indicated that soil N2O release was mainly controlled by the interaction between soil moisture and soil NO3- content (R-2=0.828, P<0.001). These results indicate that MS had a coincident effect on soil N2O flux and significantly reduced soil N2O production compared to that of M over two growing seasons.

A 2-year randomized complete block study with three replicates at New Mexico State University's Alcalde Sustainable Agriculture Science Center compared sweet maize (Zea mays var. rugosa; maize-alone) with sweet maize relay intercropped with oat (Avena sativa L.; maize-oat) or turnip (Brassica rapa L.; maize-turnip). Relay intercropping had no effect (p > 0.05) on sweet maize stover dry matter (DM) yield and there was no difference in aboveground biomass DM yield of the intercropped species. Turnip aboveground biomass had greater crude protein concentration and 48-h in vitro dry matter disappearance (IVDMD) than oat aboveground biomass. Relay intercropping with turnip improved sweet maize stover IVDMD (443, 439, and 515 g IVDMD kg(-1) for maize-alone, maize-oat, and maize-turnip, respectively, p < 0.0001). Intercropping increased animal gains compared to maize-alone (0.36, 0.52, and 0.59 kg/day for maize-alone, maize-oat, and maize-turnip, respectively, p < 0.02), likely due to provision of additional crude protein. Relay intercropping oat or turnip into sweet maize is viable for improving sweet maize stover for fall forage. In addition turnip, specifically, had a positive effect on stover nutritive value."

Two years of field experiments and further investigation by mini-rhizotron and pot experiments showed a decrease of O. crenata infection due to an allelopathic interference on the parasitic life cycle at the level of germination.

In this light, this study analyzed the effects of climate adaptation strategies on technical efficiency of maize farmers in Northern Ghana. This involved a total of 619 maize farmers that were selected through a multistage sampling procedure. A Cobb-Douglas stochastic frontier was fitted to the data. From the result, the major climate adaptation strategies adopted by the farmers include row planting, changing planting date, mixed farming, refilling, and intercropping. The frontier result shows that while climate adaptation significantly leads to higher maize outputs, only crop rotation and row planting significantly improve technical efficiency of maize farmers. Other factors that significantly influence maize output are farm size, labor, seed, and chemicals. The study concludes that climate adaptation, particularly, crop rotation and row planting, remains essential adaptation strategies for sustainable food production in the region. However, further understanding of mechanisms through which majority of the climate adaptation strategies significantly reduce technical efficiency is required.

In this study, we compare the PAE uptake by plant roots between the wheat/maize intercropping and the wheat and maize monocropping in a field work. We show that the PAE bioconcentration factors of wheat and maize roots are remarkably higher under wheat/maize intercropping than under monocropping, indicating that intercropping may significantly increase the biouptake of PAEs as compared to monocropping. The wheat/maize intercropping can increase the electron transfer capacity (ETC) of water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) in soils by increasing the abundance of redox-active functional groups in WEOM. The ETC-enhanced WEOM may be an important reason for facilitating the reduction of ferric iron [Fe(III)] minerals to soluble ferrous iron (Fe(II)] by acting as electron shuttle, thus leading to the release of the PAEs originally occluded in Fe(III) minerals into soil pore water. The increased bioavailable PAEs distributed in the soil pore water under wheat/maize inter cropping eventually result in the increase in the uptake of PAEs by plant roots from soils. The results can provide insights into the link between the uptake of PAEs by crops and the cropping practices in agricultural ecosystems.

Integrating a simple shading algorithm into CERES-wheat and CERES-maize with particular regard to a changing microclimate within a relay-intercropping system	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Intercropping; Maize; Microclimate; Modeling; Shading; Wheat"	"YIELD ADVANTAGE; MODEL; COMPETITION; RADIATION; TEMPERATURE; COMPONENTS; GROWTH; LIGHT"	Wheat/maize related multi-cropping systems are the dominant cropping systems in North China. To improve and adjust those systems, and to study competition effects within intercropping, extended field experiments are necessary. As field experiments are time consuming, laborious and expensive, a viable alternative is the use of crop growth models that can quantify the effects of management practices on crop growth and productivity. Field experiments showed that intercropped maize yielded as high as monocropped maize, and grain yield of intercropped wheat increased by up to 32%. Based on a process-oriented modeling approach, this study focuses on analyzing and modeling competitive relationships in a wheat/maize relay intercropping system with regard to yield, solar radiation and microclimate effects. A simple shading algorithm was applied and integrated into the CERES models, which are part of the DSSAT software shell vs. 4.5. The algorithm developed estimates the proportion of shading as affected by neighbouring plant height. The model was tested to investigate the applicability of this shading algorithm within the CERES models in the simulation of grain yield and dry matter yield of wheat and maize. Model error of grain and dry matter yield for both species was below 10%. There was a tendency for grain yield to be simulated adequately but for dry matter yield to be slightly underestimated. Increased top soil temperature in intercropped wheat increased the mineralization of nitrogen and improved N supply. The wheat/maize system was N efficient. Thus, N dynamics were taken into account for simulation as well as CO2 dynamics based upon modified wind speed. Wheat border rows were exposed to a higher wind speed until mid-June and to reduced wind speed thereafter. As a result, solar radiation, soil temperature and wind speed differed between monocropping and intercropping and could provide a starting point for simulating intercropping. Microclimate effects are often small, subtle or non-existent, while spatial and climate variability and the heterogeneity of plant populations can be considerable. Quantifying micro-climatic effects may prove difficult but should not be neglected when simulating intercropping systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effects of strip cropping and weed control methods on yields of dent maize, narrow-leafed lupin and oats	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION			English	Article						"Strip cropping; Dent maize; Oat; Narrow-leafed lupin; Weed control"	"SOIL-WATER; INTERCROPPING CORN; WIND EROSION; WHEAT; RADIATION; SYSTEMS; GROWTH; PRODUCTIVITY; EFFICIENCY; CHICKPEA"	"The aim of this study was to assess the effects of strip cropping and different weed control methods on the yield and yield structure of dent maize, narrow-leafed lupin and spring oat. A split-plot design with four replications was conducted in 2008-2010. The following factors were analysed in the experiment: I. Cultivation method - sole cropping and strip cropping; II. Weed control method - mechanical and chemical. The method of cultivation was considered the main plot and the weed control methods were the sub-plot. Strip cropping significantly increased the maize yield and the percentage share of ears in the total biomass. The seed yield of narrow-leafed lupin was significantly higher in strip cropping, but only where mechanical weed control was used. Strip cropping significantly increased the plant density, seed number and weight per plant and 1,000 seed weight of lupin. Oat yield was slightly higher in the strip cropping than in the sole cropping. Strip cropping increased grain number and weight per panicle in the oat. The chemical weed control method was more favourable to the yield of maize, narrow-leaf lupin and oat than the mechanical weed control. The land equivalent ratio value (1.06) confirms that the maize/narrow-leafed lupin/oat strip cropping was more efficient than the sole cropping."

A controlled 35 mm single irrigation, either early or late, was applied to each crop at a certain growth stage. Soil water, leaf area, final grain yield and yield components such as the thousand-grain weight, length of spike, fertile spikelet number, number of grains per spike, and grain weight per spike were measured, and water use efficiency and leaf area index were calculated for the irrigated and non-irrigated relay intercropping treatments and sole cropping controls. The results showed that yield, yield components, water use efficiency, and leaf area index in the relay intercropping treatments were affected by limited single drip irrigation during various growth stages of wheat and maize. The total yields in the relay intercropping treatment irrigated during the heading stage of wheat and the heading and anthesis stage of maize were the highest among all the treatments, followed by that irrigated during the anthesis stage of wheat and silking stage of maize; so was the water use efficiency. Significant differences occurred in most yield components between the irrigated and non-irrigated relay-intercropping treatments. The dynamics of the leaf area index in the relay-intercropped or solely cropped wheat and maize showed a type of single-peak pattern, whereas that of the relay intercropping treatments showed a type of double-peak pattern. Appropriately, limited single irrigation and controlled soil water content level could result in higher total yield, water use efficiency, and leaf area index, and improved yield components in relay intercropping. This practice saved the amount of water used for irrigation and also increased the yield. Therefore, heading stage of wheat and heading and anthesis stage of maize were suggested to be the optimum limited single irrigation time for relay-intercropped wheat and maize in the semi-arid area."

Although practiced for centuries, problems persist with competition for water, nutrients and light between crop species in traditional farming systems. Furthermore, little is known about farmers' perceptions regarding changes to traditional maize-legume intercropping systems and their interest in novel crop adoption to increase yields in the system while maintaining the practice. The objective of this study was to investigate the maize-based traditional cropping system by assessing the underlying motives and concepts of farmers to practice intercropping in the Yucatan Peninsula and to examine the association between farmers' level of knowledge about legumes and decisions to adopt intercropping and related practices therein. Farmer surveys were conducted in nine different regions of the Yucatan Peninsula. We selected Xoy, Euan, Muna, Mama, Tahdziu (Yucatan), Becal, Hecelchacam, Dzitbalche and San Antonio Sahcabchen (Campeche) which are representative of agroecological small-scale farming systems. We used a mixed methods case study analysis involving key informant interviews in eight associations of farmers. A sample frame with 73 farmers was selected in total during February 2021 and April 2021. Basic information such as land use, labor inputs, agricultural production and farmer's perceptions regarding their intercropping systems were collected. Our research shows that the primary motives for intercropping were due to the ability of intercropping to offer a more diversified range of food for human and animal consumption, as well as to take advantage of different harvest periods that this practice offers. The majority of respondents were likely to favor the idea of introducing new legume species in their maize-based cropping systems. Factors such as the type of cropping system (i.e., intercropping or monocropping), access to water and level of knowledge about legumes influenced their decision to adopt intercropping in their farming systems considerably. This paper contributes to the knowledge on the current state and farmers' perceptions of intercropping systems in the Yucatan Peninsula.

Performance of cowpea cultivars when grown as an intercrop with maize of contrasting maturities	ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article						"cowpea; maize; intercrop; sole crop; grain yield"	SOLE-CROP	A field trial was conducted during the rainy seasons of 2008 and 2009 at Samaru in northern Guinea savannah of Nigeria to determine the performance of semi-determinate and indeterminate cowpea cultivars intercropped with extra early, early and late maize cultivars. The trial was laid out in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) having treatments arranged as a split-plot factorial. Transmitted radiation was reduced by 49-63% due to shading by the maize plants. Similarly, intercropping cowpea with maize reduced intercepted radiation, fodder yield and grain yield of cowpea by 59-70%, 39-51% and 45-62%, respectively. Intercepted radiation and yields of intercropped cowpea were lower for late maize which maintained high leaf area over a longer period of time. This is supported by the higher plant height, higher leaf area index (LAI) and reduced transmitted radiation recorded in late maize compared with extra early and early maize. Extra early and early maize were less competitive with cowpea because of shorter period of association in addition to permitting higher radiation. Crop value of maize plus cowpea was higher than that of sole cowpea ($2616.8 vs. $1218.7ha(-1)) because higher combined yield was achieved by a more efficient use of resources in the intercrop. Therefore, cowpea cultivar may be intercropped with extra early maize.

Radiant energy reaching the soil surface and maximum diumal soil temperatures were lower with intercropping, with the lowest values being observed in the fertilized plots, Similarly, soil moisture content and earthworm activity were greater with intercropping, with the highest values occurring in fertilized plots. Soil fertility, especially N, was lower in intercropping than in cassava grown alone, with the lowest fertility occurring in non-fertilized mixtures, Intercropping with fertilizer application thus lowered exposure and temperature, and increased soil water and earthworm activity. Inclusion of maize with cassava increased plant height, reduced leaf area index and stem branching and diameter, favoured lodging, delayed bulking of storage roots and decreased nutrient uptake in cassava. The ability of cassava to compensate for impaired early growth after maize harvest depended strongly on soil fertility, especially the level of nitrogen.

Experiments were conducted in the summer season to compare the yield and nutritional composition of the forage and silage quality of mono-cropped maize and intercropped maize-soybean harvested at two stages of maturity. The main treatments were one sole crop maize (SM) and four maize-soybean intercropping patterns (one-row maize to one-row soybean (1M1S), one-row maize to two-row soybean (1M2S), one-row maize to three-row soybean (1M3S), and two-row maize to one-row soybean (2M1S). The crops were harvested when the maize reached the milk (R3) and maturity (R6) stages. Results indicated a significant increase in the fresh biomass and dry-matter production of maize fodder alone compared with those of maize intercropped with soybean fodder. After 60 days of ensiling period, silage samples were analyzed for pH, organic acids, dry matter, crude protein (CP), ether extract, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and other mineral compositions. All intercropped silages showed higher CP values (1M1S, 12.1%; 1M2S, 12.2%; 1M3S, 12.4%; and 2M1S, 12.1%) than the SM silage (8.7%). Higher organic acids were produced in 1M3S than in the other silages. Correlation data showed that CP was highly correlated with lactic acid but negatively associated with crude fiber, nitrogen-free extract, and NDF. Thus, the intercropping of maize and soybean silage is recommended due its enhanced crop production, nutritional values in dairy animals, and prolific animal feedings and because it was scientifically evaluated as a feed stuff. This study indicated that 1M3S was the most preferable among intercropped silages in terms of nutrient composition."

Two maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids (704, 301), vetch (Vicia villosa), bitter vetch (Vicia ervilia), berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) sole crops as well as intercrops of maize hybrids with each of the legumes were used to evaluate the effects of legumes on forage yield and quality. The experiment was carried out as randomized complete block design with three replications. The results showed that intercropping systems had a significant effect on the dry matter yield, crude protein (CP) yield, ash content, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) concentration. The CP yield, dry matter yield and ash content of maize forage increased by intercropping as compared with the maize monoculture. Also intercropping of legumes with maize significantly reduced NDF and ADF content, thus increasing digestibility of the forage. The highest and lowest NDF and ADF content were achieved in maize hybrid (704) monoculture, intercropping of maize hybrid (301) with bitter vetch, vetch and bean, respectively. In all intercropping treatments, land equivalent ratios (LER) were well above 1 indicating yield advantages for intercropping. It can be concluded that maize-legumes intercrops could substantially increase forage quantity and quality and decrease requirements for protein supplements as compared with the maize monocultures.

UTILIS; IMPERATA-CYLINDRICA; GRAIN-YIELD; MANAGEMENT; CORN; COMPETITION; AFRICA; COWPEA; COVER"	"Use of legume cover crops has been reported to improve maize productivity through various mechanisms that include improved soil mineral N supply and weed control. However, in the smallholder irrigation farming sector, where maize is the staple crop, strategies for intercropping summer legume cover crops are often a challenge for farmers. Field experiments were conducted in a warm-temperate region of South Africa during the summer season of 2007/08 and 2008/09 to investigate the effects of strip intercropping patterns (3:2; 4: 2 and 6:2 patterns) on the productivity of maize (cv. PAN 6479) together with mucuna or sunnhemp. The strip-intercrop patterns did not result in improved soil mineral N or weed control. Maize yields from rows adjacent to the cover crop strips were significantly (P < 0.01) lower than other rows. The 3:2 strip intercropping pattern slightly depressed yields; however, yield reduction was more pronounced in the 1st season where water stress was experienced with maize partial land equivalent ratios (PLER) of 0.55 and 0.98 in the 2007/08 and 2008/09 seasons respectively. A long winter fallow period reduced the positive impact of legume cover crops on soil mineral N and weed control benefits, resulting in no observable yield increase in a subsequent maize crop. Summer legume cover crops may enhance productivity of winter food/cash crops; however, this requires further investigation."	"[Murungu, F.

"PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS; WATER-STRESS; GROWTH; NODULATION; POPULATION; NITROGEN; MIXTURES"	Bush bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is widely intercropped with maize (Zea mays L.) in North-west Spain. Little information is available on the relative performance of elite bush bean cultivars when intercropped or on the effect of bush bean on performance of the maize crop. This two-environment study presents the interactions between improved bush bean cultivars and maize on yield and yield components. Eight treatments (four bean/maize intercrops and four sole crops, two of bean and two of maize) were tested using a randomized complete block design with four replications in two environments. Bean and maize were planted simultaneously in alternate rows when intercropped. Significant treatment differences were observed for bean and maize moisture, pod and cob percentage, bean and maize yield, ears per plant and ear length. Location effects were significant for bean and maize moisture and pod percentage. Significant treatment by location interactions occurred for pod percentage and ear length. Intercropping reduced yield by between 40 and 60% for bush bean cultivars, and by 45% for both maize cultivars. Mean yields were used to calculate the land equivalent ratio (LER), which averaged 1.01 in Pontevedra but 0.93 in La Coruna. Intercropping of bush bean with maize did not make better use of land than conventional sole cropping under these environmental conditions. It is suggested that this was probably due to the amount and distribution of rain in relation to crop growth. Approaches that might be expected to result in improved land usage are presented.

J	"Krishna, A; Raikhelkar, SV"				"Krishna, A; Raikhelkar, SV"			Crop complementarity and competition in maize (Zea mays) when intercropped with different legumes	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						"maize-equivalent yield; relative crowding coefficient; aggressivity; competitive ratio; Zea mays"		Intercrops of different oilseeds and pulses with maize (Zea mays L.) with different fertilizer doses were grown in medium black soil. 'Deccan Double Hybrid' maize was intercropped with 'BDN 2' pigeonpea [Cajanus cajans (L.) Millsp.],'S 8' greengram (Phaseolus radiatus L.), 'T 9' blackgram (Phaseolus mungo L.), 'JL 24' groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) and 'PK 472' soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. Significant higher maize-equivalent yield was recorded in maize + pigeonpea (4.88 tonnes/ha) and maize + blackgram (4.66 tonnes/ha) intercropping systems. There was significant response to application of N25P50 to intercrops, as well as that of N120P60K40 to maize. The interaction of intercropping system x fertilizer levels (for 2 years) revealed that for maize + pigeonpea system the application of N25P50 to intercrops gave significantly higher maize-equivalent yield (5.25 tomes/ha) than the control. For maize + greengram, maize + blackgram and maize + groundnut the application of N125P25 for intercrops gave significantly higher maize-equivalent yield (4.57, 4.67 and 4.49 tonnes/ha respectively) than N25P50 and the control (N120P60K40). The intercropping of maize + soybean needs N25P50 for intercrops in addition to application of N120P60K40 to maize. The data on relative crowding coefficient showed greater intensity of competition in pigeonpea system due to more favourable effect (higher value of K = 6.276),whereas maize + soybean combination recorded lower values of the coefficient (K = 1.21) resulting in lower competition. The aggressivity values showed that maize was vigorous hi growth habit compared with intercrops. The values of competitive ratio (CRa) revealed that the competition was higher (more than twice) in maize + pigeonpea, maize + groundnut and maize + soybean intercropping system. The land-equivalent ratios showed that there was yield advantage of 84% with maize + blackgram and 83% with maize + greengram when compared with sole crop of maize.

For this purpose, through an operational flow chart, authors have per -formed mycotoxin-hazard analysis in the pre-and post-harvest phases and applied Food Safety Objective (FSO) and Performance Objective (PO) concept.Mycotoxin-hazard and analysis of control measures in the pre-harvest operations indicated that the most important practices at pre-harvest level for the control of mycotoxins in wheat/maize chain may include: (i) land preparation, such as tillage, cover crop and crop rotation, (ii) planting and antifungal mulch treatment, appli-cation of botanical extracts and intercropping, (iii) application of fungal biocontrol agents to reduce aflatoxins and (iv) application of fungal and bacterial biocontrol agents. For the post-harvest operations one Critical Control Point (CCP) and five Control Points (CPs) have been determined. The CCP includes an intervention measure that can be applied during storage, such as the application of treatments with volatile bioactive compounds, cold plasma, ozonisation or UV treatment. The results of FSO/PO analysis applied to wheat/maize chain revealed that FSO (the maximum level of mycotoxins in final food products given in European legislation) could be reached by combining conventional production steps such as cleaning and milling with different intervention strategies. For all strategies presented here, application on actual food production site must take into account local specificities and its interaction with climatic conditions.

The objective of this work was to assess the possibility of lowering applied N rate in maize fields associated with less weeds infestation and keeping/boosting productivity. Thus, a field experiment was conducted to evaluate the response of maize yield and associated weeds to N levels (0, 144, 216, and 288 kg N ha(-1)) as well as maize (M)-cowpea (C) intercrops, sole-M, MC same ridge, MC alternating ridges, and sole-C. MC alternating ridges intercrop decreased weed biomass by 49.5% compared with sole-M. Sole-M was similar to MC alternating ridges intercrop in producing the maximum maize grain yield per hectare. In plots fertilized with 216 or 288 kg N ha(-1), MC alternating ridges were statistically at par with sole-M for enhancing maize grain yield per hectare. Medium N application level (216 kg N ha(-1)) with MC alternating ridges showed the highest agronomic efficiency (14.6 kg kg(-1)). MC alternating ridges intercrop can save 26% of the cultivated land.

The major objective of this study was to determine the distribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and soil aggregates and their interrelationship across soil depths in intercropping systems. Methods A three-year positioning experiment based on a two-factor experimental design at two N application levels (N0 and N2) and different cropping systems (maize/soybean intercropping and corresponding monocultures) was started in 2017. Soil samples were collected from 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm for analyzing soil aggregates and from 0-15 cm, 15-30 cm, 30-5 cm, and 45-60 cm for determining the AMF composition. Results It was observed that intercropping improved the macro-aggregate (> 5 mm) content at 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm depths for maize soil and only 0-15 cm depth for soybean soil without N treatment. The application of N decreased the macro-aggregate content in the intercropping soil at 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm depths. Moreover, intercropping significantly improved the AMF diversity of maize and soybean soils across soil depths, while the application of N reduced the AMF diversity of soil across depths. Conclusions The structural equation modeling analysis indicated that the intercropping system influenced the stability of soil aggregates and promoted the formation of large aggregates by altering soil nutrients and the diversity of AMF. The results further revealed the reasons behind soil fertility improvement by adopting crop diversification.

A 2-year field experiment was conducted from 2002 to 2003 in irrigated areas in North-West of China to investigate how phosphorus fertilizer application and intercropping of wheat/maize/potato impact on the crop yield and wheat-grain components such as protein content, wet gluten and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) sedimentation. The results indicated that bread wheat and maize achieved higher yields in the intercropping system than in the monoculture system over the 2 years, and the wheat-grain had higher protein content, wet gluten and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) sedimentation in the intercropping system than in the monoculture system. Better utilization of resources through border row effect and preventing competition between species over growing period have been indicated as the major factors contributing to the increased crop yield and wheat-grain components. Phosphorus application significantly increased crop yields and improved wheat-grain components; however, the optimal application rate for achieving highest protein content was at 150 kg ha(-1). The practical implication of the present study was that to obtain good yield and better wheat-grain components, a combination of intercropping and application of phosphorus fertilizer at a rate of approximately 150 kg ha(-1) was found as one of the most practical options."

Productivity of maize (Zea mays) under different crop sequences and irrigation regimes	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						"Economics; Energetics; Irrigation regimes; Maize; Water productivity"	"WATER PRODUCTIVITY; SYSTEMS; ENERGY"	A two year field experiment was conducted at Research farm of Department of Agronomy, Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana during kharif 2016 and kharif 2017. The experiment was laid out in split-plot design with seven maize (Zea mays L.) based crop sequences, viz. maize-wheat, maize-potato-mentha + onion, maize + cowpea (f)-potato-mentha + onion, maize + cowpea (f)-potato-spring maize, maize + cowpea (f)-gobhi sarson-summer moong, maize-toria + gobhi sarson-summer moong and maize + cowpea (f)-toria + gobhi sarson-summer moong in main plots and four irrigation schedules of 0.75 IW/CPE, 1.0 IW/CPE, 1.25 IW/CPE and recommended schedule in sub plots replicated thrice. Intercropping of cowpea with maize increased the grain yield, crop and water productivity, energy output and net returns of kharif maize. The maximum grain yield of maize was recorded under recommended schedule which was statistically at par with 1.25 IW/CPE irrigation regime. Irrigation regime of 1.0 IW/CPE recorded the highest apparent water productivity with 3.00 and 3.07 kg/m(3) during 2016 and 2017, respectively.

Legume-nonlegume intercropping systems can reduce N input by exploiting biological N fixation by legumes. Measurement of N utilization can help in dissecting the mechanisms underlying N uptake and utilization in legume-nonlegume intercropping systems. An experiment was performed with three planting patterns: monoculture maize (MM), monoculture soybean (SS), and maize-soybean relay intercropping (IMS), and three N application levels: zero N (NN), reduced N (RN), and conventional N (CN) to investigate crop N uptake and utilization characteristics. N recovery efficiency and N-15 recovery rate of crops were higher under RN than under CN, and those under RN were higher under intercropping than under the corresponding monocultures. Compared with MM, IMS showed a lower soil N-dependent rate (SNDR) in 2012. However, the SNDR of MM rapidly declined from 86.8% in 2012 to 49.4% in 2014, whereas that of IMS declined slowly from 75.4% in 2012 to 69.4% in 2014. The interspecific N competition rate (NCRms) was higher under RN than under CN, and increased yearly. Soybean nodule dry weight and nitrogenase activities were respectively 34.2% and 12.5% higher under intercropping than in monoculture at the beginning seed stage. The amount (Ndfa) and ratio (%Ndfa) of soybean N-2 fixation were significantly greater under IS than under SS. In conclusion, N fertilizer was more efficiently used under RN than under CN; in particular, the relay intercropping system promoted N fertilizer utilization in comparison with the corresponding monocultures. An intercropping system helps to maintain soil fertility because interspecific N competition promotes biological N fixation by soybean by reducing N input. Thus, a maize-soybean relay intercropping system with reduced N application is sustainable and environmentally friendly. (C) 2019 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS.

It is difficult to maintain the health and milk production of the livestock without supply of the quality green fodder. Therefore, the study was carried out to evaluate the forage quality of maize and legumes as influenced by varying intercropping combinations. This experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design (RCBD) with seven treatments consisting of three different forage crops, viz. maize, cowpea and guar sown in sole as well as in 1:1 and 2:1 intercropping combinations of forage cereal with legume crop components in three replications. Experimental results showed that the highest dry matter yield (94.89 q/ha) was obtained in maize+ cowpea (2:1) intercropping combinations. The quality parameters of different forage crops, viz. Organic Matter, Crude Protein, Ether Extract, Ash Content, Neutral Detergent Fiber, Acid Detergent Fiber, Acid Detergent Lignin, NDICP and ADICP were influenced significantly and favourably with inclusion of both legumes. Among intercropping combinations Maize:legume (1:1) was better over Maize:legume (2:1) and sole maize. The CP, EE and Ash yield were influenced significantly and maximum value were observed 10.74, 1.99 and 9.4 q/ha, respectively in forage maize+ cowpea (2:1) ratio. Among the different forage crops, the fiber fractions were observed minimum in (1:1) intercropping ratio of maize with legume components as compares to their sole component as well as (2:1) intercropping combinations. The insoluble crude protein content was found minimum in (1:1) intercropping combination and influenced significantly with their respective (2:1) or sole crop.

Farmers of the region sow many crops in a piece of land, without following any row proportion geometrics and hence crop productivity is considerably low. A research was carried out to assess the feasibility of raising intercrops in association with maize (Zea mays L.) at ICAR Research Complex for NEH Region, Basar during 2010 and 2011. The results indicated that biomass accumulation was the highest with 1:1 than in the 1:5 row proportions. Leaf area index of maize with intercrop was the highest with 1:5 row proportions. The maize grain yield was obtained relatively higher with solitary maize followed by 1:2 of maize-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. Maize equivalent yield was 55.5% higher with 1:5 of maize-groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) over the solitary maize, consequently, production efficiency was remarkably improved by 48.9% with 1:5 of maize-groundnut. Land equivalent ratio, area time equivalent ratio and monetory advantage index were favourable for the intercropping implying their intrinsic advantage over solitary planting. Weed density and dry biomass were lower with 1:5 row proportions which resulted in higher weed smothering efficiency.	"[Choudhary, V. K.; Dixit, Anil; Kumar, P.

This benefit was associated with increased phytosiderophore secretion by maize and increased Fe(III)-chelate reductase activity by peanut. In the present study, we isolated the full-length cDNA of AhIRT1 (iron-regulated transporter 1) from peanut and characterized how iron deficiency and intercropping affected its iron-transporting ability. Functional complementation with AhIRT1 restored normal growth of the yeast mutant fet3fet4 (defective in both high- and low-affinity iron-uptake systems) under iron-deficiency conditions. Based on transient expression analysis. AhIRT1 was determined to be a membrane protein, which was consistent with a function in iron uptake. In peanut, transcript levels of AhIRT1 increased in both root and shoot under iron-deficiency conditions.

Furthermore, nitrogen requirement may also varying according to proportion of legume component. Therefore, the present study was carried out to evaluate the effect of different intercropping ratios and nitrogen levels on productivity and nutritional quality of fodder maize (Zea mays L.) and Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.). The experiment was laid out in split plot arrangement with three intercropping row ratios of maize: cowpea (1:1, 2:1 and 1:2, respectively) in main plot and five nitrogen levels (0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 kg N/ha) in sub plot. Highest total green fodder, protein and ash yield in 2:1 ratio whereas maximum ether yield was reported in 1:2 intercropping ratio of maize and cowpea. However, the maximum crude protein, ether extract, ash content and lowest NDF, ADF and ADL of maize and cowpea, respectively were obtained under 1:2 intercropping ratio of maize and cowpea. Among N levels, highest total green fodder, crude protein, ether and ash yield and as well as their content in green forage of maize and cowpea were recorded with the use of 120 kg N/ha. However, cowpea responded significantly upto 60 kg N/ha only. The lowest NDF, ADF and ADL of maize and cowpea were found when these crops fertilized with 120 Kg N/ha. A significant interaction between intercropping ratios and N levels was reported in terms of yield. Thus, it can be concluded that nitrogen rates 90, 120 and 60 kg/ha found suitable to achieve maximum fodder yield in 1:1, 2:1 and 1:2 (maize: cowpea) ratios, respectively.

There were two planting systems (maize/soybean, maize/peanut intercropping) coupled with three biochar application rates (0, 15, and 30 t ha(-1)). Changes in the soil water content, soil bulk density, temperature, soil nutrients and yield were recorded. Under the influence of rainfall, biochar significantly increased soil water storage at the 0-30 cm soil layer. The maximum increment of soil water storage was 15.5% with the maize/peanut intercropping at 15 t ha(-1) treatment at the tassel stage. Both biochar treatments significantly increased the soil effective accumulated temperature at the seedling stage and jointing stage. The greatest increment in soil effective accumulated temperature was achieved using the maize/peanut intercropping at 15 t ha(-1) treatment. The effects of biochar on soil effective accumulated temperature were weakened at the tasselling, grain filling and mature stages. After biochar application, the soil mineral nitrogen content was significantly reduced at the seeding stage, but significantly increased by 25.2-48.9% at the tasselling and grain filling stages. The soil ammonium and nitrate nitrogen content of the soybean and peanut ridges was significantly higher than those of the corn ridges. The total yield of maize/soybean increased by 12.8-13.7% and the total yield of maize/peanut intercropping increased by 15.9-18.0% relative to the treatment without biochar. Therefore, both 15 t ha(-1) and 30 t ha(-1) effectively regulated the soil water, nutrient and temperature at the jointing, tasselling and grain filling stages, which enhanced the positive effects of intercropping on crop yield. From an analysis of the yield results, it was found that biochar may be more significant in the maize/peanut intercropping system.

A promising method for improving crop production and environmental conditions is to intercrop sweet maize with legumes. Here, a three-year field experiment was conducted to assess the influence of four different cropping systems (sole sweet maize (SS), sole soybean (SB), two rows sweet maize-three rows soybean (S2B3) intercropping, arid two rows sweet maize-four rows soybean (S2B4) intercropping), together with two rates of N fertilizer application (300 and 360 kg N ha(-1)) on grain yield, residual soil mineral N, and soil N2O emissions in southern China. Results showed that in most case, intercropping achieved yield advantages (total land equivalent ratio (TLER = 0.87-1.25) was above one). Moreover, intercropping resulted in 39.8% less soil mineral N than SS at the time of crop harvest, averaged over six seasons (spring and autumn in each of the three years of the field experiment). Generally, intercropping and reduced-N application (300 kg N ha(-1)) produced lower cumulative soil N2O and yield-scaled soil N2O emissions than SS and conventional-N application (360 kg N ha(-1)), respectively. S2B4 intercropping with reduced-N rate (300 kg N ha(-1)) showed the lowest cumulative soil N2O (mean value = 0.61 kg ha(-1)) and yield-scaled soil N2O (mean value = 0.04 kg t(-1)) emissions. Overall, intercropping with reduced-N rate maintained sweet maize production, while also reducing environmental impacts. The system of S2B4 intercropping with reduced-N rate may be the most sustainable and environmentally friendly cropping system.

Application of N-fertilizer significantly increased maize grain and cassava root yields as well as N, P and K concentrations of both crops compared with application of non-N fertilizer or with the unfertilized controls, Intercropping, with or without fertilizer application, led to a decrease in the root yield and N, P and K concentrations of cassava, but had no significant effect on nutrient concentrations and grain yield of maize. Growth analysis revealed that from 20 weeks after planting to harvest in cassava and during the flowering to harvest in maize dry matter accumulation in both crops was similar in intercropping. However, during the same period, the mean crop growth rate in cassava was less than a fourth of the mean crop growth rate in maize. It was concluded that the main factor limiting total yield in a cassava-maize intercropping system is the depression of early cassava growth by vigorous maize component, which reduces the amount of assimilate allocated to cassava roots.

The objective of this study was to measure the performance of two intercropped systems in terms of total above-ground biomass production and maize (Zea mays) grain yield: pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) and Brachiaria (Brachiaria ruziziensis) sown as cover crops in established maize under a no-tillage management. The cover crops were sown at two different dates and a comparison was made with the three crops sown as a sole crop at the early sowing date. The experiment was conducted during the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 growing seasons. Maize grain yield was not reduced by the presence of the relay cover crops in comparison with maize as the sole crop, even when the cover crop was sown soon after maize emergence. In contrast, the production of above-ground biomass by the cover crop was significantly lower when grown with maize than it was when grown as a sole crop. In the intercropped systems, when sown early, the cover crop produced higher total biomass than when sown late. Total above-ground biomass production of maize intercropped with a cover crop was much higher than that of any of the crops sown alone: the total biomass (average of the two growing seasons) produced by maize and pigeon pea was more than double that of maize grown alone. The land equivalent ratio (LER) of maize grain yield and biomass production was higher than one whatever the intercropped system used. It was particularly high when maize was intercropped with early sown pigeon pea; grain yield LER and biomass LER reaching, respectively, 1.72 and 1.73 in 2007-2008 and 2.02 and 2.03 in 2008-2009. These high LER values provide evidence for the complementary and the high efficiency of use of available resources by the intercropped plants and thus the advantage of such systems to produce both maize grain and cover crop forage under the conditions of our study.

Early (Katumani) and mid-late (A511) maize varieties were interplanted with sweetpotato simultaneously, 15 days, 30 days, and 45 days after emergence (DAE) of maize, using an additive type of intercropping. Grain yield of maize was not affected by simultaneously-interplanted sweetpotato, but later interplanting decreased grain yield particularly in very dry years. Intercropping reduced tuber yield by more than 50% regardless of planting time. Land equivalent ratio (LER) was consistently higher than 1.5 in sweetpotato-Katumani mixtures, because sweetpotato was less affected by Katumani compared to A511. About 80% of the joint LER was contributed by maize. There was no difference in water use between intercrops and sole crops, and water use was much lower than the available soil water, when compared with maize plants grown with suppressed inter-row evaporation. This study indicated that higher LER values, relatively stable yield over seasons, and a high amount of feed from sweetpotato vines would be obtained if early-maturing maize varieties were interplanted with shade-tolerant sweetpotato simultaneously in long-growing seasons.

Maize/soybean relay strip intercropping has significant advantages on the increase of crop yields and efficient use of agricultural resources, but its effects on the occurrence and pathogen population of soybean root rot are rarely known. In this study, root rot was investigated in the fields of the continuous maize/soybean strip relay intercropping and soybean monoculture. Fusarium species were isolated from diseased soybean roots and identified based on sequence analysis of translation elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2), and the diversity and pathogenicity of these species were also analyzed. Our results showed that intercropping significantly decreased soybean root rot over monoculture. A more diverse Fusarium population including Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC), F. incarnatum-equiseti species complex (FIESC), F. oxysporum, F. fujikuroi, F. proliferatum and F. verticillioides, F. graminearum and F. asiaticum was identified from intercropping while FSSC, FIESC, F. oxysporum, F. commune, F. asiaticum and F. meridionale were found from monoculture. All Fusarium species caused soybean root infection but exhibited distinct aggressiveness. The most aggressive F. oxysporum was more frequently isolated in monoculture than intercropping. FSSC and FIESC were the dominant species complex and differed in their aggressiveness. Additionally, F. fujikuroi, F. proliferatum and F. verticillioides were specifically identified from intercropping with weak or middle aggressiveness. Except for F. graminearum, F. meridionale and F. asiaticum were firstly reported to cause soybean root rot in China. This study indicates maize/soybean relay strip intercropping can reduce soybean root rot, change the diversity and aggressiveness of Fusarium species, which provides an important reference for effective management of this disease.

Results showed that maize planted (alternate-rows) simultaneously with cowpea and soybean recorded significantly higher values of leaf area index (LAI), leaf area ratio (LAR) and net assimilation rate (NAR). Highest values of NAR was recorded at R1 stage; LAI, LAR and relative growth rate (RGR) through at vegetative growth stage. LAI (sole maize) and NAR (1M+1C) showed significant correlation with grain yield. LAR and RGR for maize decreased from VT to R6. The LAI and NAR at silking stage have been identified as the major determinants of grain yield."

Little is known about the relative contribution of indigenous and introduced AM fungi and rhizobia to nutrient acquisition of intercropped soybean and maize in unsterilized soils. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of indigenous and introduced AM fungi and rhizobia in a soybean/maize intercropping system under unsterilized soil conditions. The results show that introduced rhizobial inoculation promoted soybean nodulation and growth. Single AM fungal inoculation promoted indigenous rhizobial nodulation and increased maize AM root colonization, but had little effect on maize growth. Co-inoculation strongly increased plant dry weight, and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content of the intercropped soybean compared to those with only indigenous rhizobial and AM fungal communities, but had no effect on those of maize in the same intercropped system. These results indicate that AM fungal inoculation promoted nodulation by indigenous rhizobia. Effective rhizobial inoculation combined with introduced AM fungi may not only promote symbiotic N2 fixation, but also enhance rhizosphere processes, which has the potential to improve nutrient acquisition in the field. Soybean is a weak competitor compared with maize in intercropping systems. Inoculation with introduced AM and rhizobia ameliorated the growth suppression of intercropped soybean, but inhibited growth of intercropped maize, indicating that inoculation of introduced AM fungi and/or rhizobia partly shifted the competitive advantage from maize to soybean. In conclusion, introduced AM fungi and rhizobia contributed more than indigenous populations to promoting growth and nutrient acquisition of the intercropped soybean in unsterilized soils.

How plants respond under these conditions and then affect the structure and function of communities remain important questions. Maize (Zea mays L.) was intercropped with potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.). In the field experiment, we applied fertilizer both homogeneously and heterogeneously under monocropping and intercropping conditions. The heterogeneous nutrient treatment in intercropping was designed with different fertilizer placements, at intraspecific and interspecific rows, respectively. In the pot experiment, crops were grown under both homogeneous and heterogeneous nitrogen conditions with single plant, intraspecific and interspecific competition. Shoot and root biomass and yield were measured to analyse crop performance. In the field experiment, the heterogeneous nitrogen, compared with the homogenous one, enhanced the performance of the intercropped crop. Importantly, this effect of heterogeneous nitrogen was greater when fertilizer was applied at interspecific rows, rather than at intraspecific rows. Moreover, in pot experiments, the root foraging precision of the two crops was increased by interspecific neighbours, but only that of potatoes was increased by intraspecific neighbours. The integrated responses of plants to heterogeneous neighbours and nutrients depend on the position of nutrient-rich patches, which deepen our understanding of the function of plant diversity, and show that fertilizer placement within multi-cropping systems merits more attention. Moreover, the enhanced utilization of heterogeneous nitrogen could drive overyielding in multi-cropping systems.

Nine growth stages of monocropping maize were chosen to study the dynamic process of extraction of heavy metals. The total content of heavy metals extracted by the aerial part of monocropped maize increased in a sigmoidal pattern over the effective accumulative temperature. The biggest biomass, highest extraction content, and lowest heavy metals bioaccumulation level occurred at physiological maturity. Among the different planting patterns, including monocropping and intercropping of maize and/or soybean (Glycine max), pea (Pisum sativum), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa), the extraction efficiency of Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd varied greatly. Only intercropping of maize and soybean yielded relatively higher extraction efficiency for the four metals with no significant difference in the total biomass. Moreover, the heavy metals concentrations in dry biomass from all the planting patterns in the present study were within China's national legal thresholds for fodder use. Therefore, slightly polluted alkaline soils can be safely used through monocropping and intercropping of maize and/or legumes for a range of purposes. In particular, this study indicated that intercropping improves soil ecosystems polluted by heavy metals compared with monocropping.

Intercropping is a diversified and sustainable agricultural technique with optimized cropping intensity. Intercropping is used to obtain a higher yield and more balanced products per unit area. This study was performed at Aidyn Research Institute, Nur Sultan, Kazakhstan, in 2018 and 2019 to identify the effects of different sowing patterns on maize-white bean (Zea mays-Phaseolus vulgaris) sowing systems. The field experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Goynuk-98 was used for white beans, and SY Miami was used for maize, with 20 cm and 40 cm row spaces for maize, and 10 cm and 20 cm row spaces for white bean and sole maize, sole white bean, maize-white bean-maize-white bean, maize-white bean-white bean-maize and white bean-maize-maize-white bean sowing systems. The results showed that wide row spacing was better than narrow row spacing in terms of land equivalent ratio (LER) for both maize and white beans, but grain yield was higher in narrow row spacing. Yield items for both maize and white beans showed higher values in intercropping. Grain yield was higher in sole sowing. The maize-white bean-white bean-maize sowing system for maize and the white bean-maize-maize-white bean sowing system for white beans were determined as the best sowing systems according to the yield components.

However, studies on the separation of the complementarity effect (CE) and selection effect (SE) on yield and nutrient uptake to understand the underlying mechanisms of intercropping mediated by N application rates are relatively few. Here, field experiments with four N application rates (maize: 0, 180, 240, and 300 kg N ha(-1); soybean: 0, 40, 80, and 120 kg N ha(-1)) were conducted to study yield and nutrient uptake advantages in the maize/soybean intercropping system in 2017 and 2018. Intercropping significantly enhanced the maize yield and decreased the soybean yield, and yield advantage was observed across all N application rates. Also, the gross profit was significantly affected by N application rates and intercropping, and the maximum increase in intercropped compared to that of monoculture appeared at the N2 treatment in 2018. Moreover, nutrient uptake was significantly affected by intercropping and N application rates; the N uptake of the intercropping system (on average of two years) was highest at the N2 application rate, which increased by 13.8% compared to that of monoculture system. CE and SE of grain yield were positive over the two-year study and were both the main contributions. Furthermore, SE in N and P (only observed in 2017) uptake increased with the increase in N application rate, and SE was the main contribution to P uptake. Application of the additive partitioning method to intercropping may help to analyze the drivers of yield and nutrient advantage of intercropping and promote careful management of fertilizer application to improve nutrient use efficiency."

"SOIL; PHOSPHATE; ACQUISITION; ACID; AVAILABILITY; MOBILIZATION; DESORPTION; MECHANISM"	Intercropping or rotating of P-efficient crop species Which mobilize sparingly soluble P by their root exudates can have beneficial effects on growth and P uptake of P-inefficient species. We aimed at studying the effect of intercropping or incorporating of crop residues of P-efficient crops on the components of maize P-uptake, i.e. the root-system size and P influx (P-uptake rate per unit root length). This was studied in 3 pot experiments in a low-P sandy soil. In the first experiment, maize was intercropped with white lupine, sugar beet or oilseed rape, and with groundnut in the second experiment. In the third experiment, maize was grown after incorporating the crop residues of white lupine, sugar beet or oilseed rape. Maize growth and yield was strongly inhibited when intercropped with white lupine, sugar beet or oilseed rape, probably because of competition for nutrients. But with groundnut as the accompanying species, maize yield was increased by a factor of 3, mainly because of an enhanced P influx. Crop residues of oilseed rape and sugar beet increased the yield of maize by factors 2 and 1.6, respectively, because of a 3 and 2 times higher P uptake as compared to maize grown after maize without incorporation of crop residue. The reason for the higher maize P-uptake after oilseed rape was an 11 times higher P influx as compared to maize without crop residues, and after sugar beet residues because of an enhanced root growth and a 4 times higher P influx. Lupine residues did not improve maize growth, mainly because of a low P influx, which was even less than that of maize grown without crop residues. The soil solution P concentration and calcium acetate lactate-extractable P (CAL P) measured in this study did not reflect the P availability as indicated by the plants (P uptake, P influx). This indicates that other mechanisms such as P mobilization in the rhizosphere by root exudates or cell-wall components were responsible for the increased P availability. These mechanisms need further investigation.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of forms of implementation of intercropping of irrigated autumn maize with tropical forages on yield, decomposition, nutrient accumulation and release, and on the ratio of lignin/total N of forage residues, yield components, and grain yield of subsequent soybean, and on soil physical and chemical properties, under no-tillage in lowland Cerrado. The experiment was arranged in randomized blocks in a factorial (4 x 3 + 1) design with one control and four replications. The treatments consisted of four forages: Palisade grass, Congo grass, and two Guinea grass cultivars (Tanzania and Aries); and three methods of sowing intercrops of forageautumn maize: forage sown simultaneously with maize in the sowing furrow, mixed with fertilizer; forage sown by broadcasting on the day of maize sowing; and forage seeds mixed with fertilizer broadcast on maize in growth stage V4; plus a control (maize monoculture). The decomposition and nutrient release rate of the forage residues were evaluated by the litter bag method, 30, 60, 90, and 120 days after desiccation. Sowing the forages in the furrow and by broadcasting raise the total amount of maize residues compared to method V4. Regardless of the forage type and sowing methods, intercropping increases the amount of residues compared to maize monoculture. The forages and sowing methods had no influence on nutrient accumulation in the residues at the time of desiccation and at the lowest lignin/total N ratio in Congo grass residues, and a logarithmic decay was observed. Forage and sowing methods did not influence the macronutrient release rate from crop residues for 120 days after desiccation; the release of N, P, K and Mg is logarithmic and the release of Ca and S exponential.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the performance of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) in succession to the intercropped of maize (Zea mays) second crop with different densities of Crotalaria spectabilis. The experiment was sowing on February 15, 2016, in an experimental area of Embrapa Agrossilvopastoral, in the city of Sinop/MT. The experimental design was a randomized complete block, with four replications. Each plot had 11 lines with 0.45 cm of spacing and 10 meters of length, being considered as useful area, the three central plots. The treatments consisted of 4 densities of C. spectabilis, being 10, 20, 30 and 40kg of seeds per hectare, besides the control with the single maize. The sowing of the soybean was carried out in October 2016, under the plots harvested from the maize intercropped with the Crotalaria, where the cultivar M 8210IPRO was used and at the end of the cycle 10 plants of the useful area of each plot were collected, so that Production components. With the results obtained, it was possible to observe that the crotalaria did not cause a reduction in corn grain yield, but in only one consortium cycle, it did not allow the increase of grain yield of the soybean. Therefore, the continuity of the work must be carried out in order to be able to obtain increases in soybean production in succession, and also to evaluate the best C. spectabilis density to be used in intercropping.

Integration of legumes such as groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) and pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.) improve soil fertility and subsequent cereal crop productivity through biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), and high-quality residues. The objective of this four-year, multi-site, on-farm study in Malawi was to evaluate diverse legume systems, quantify crop production, economic viability, and total N accumulation in groundnut and pigeonpea. The study involved six research sites with different agricultural productivity potential based on precipitation, elevation, and temperature; to evaluate crop performance by environment. The six cropping systems evaluated were sole pigeonpea or sole groundnut rotated with maize (Zea mays L.) (PP-MZ and GN-MZ), groundnut/pigeonpea intercrop rotated with maize (GNPP-MZ), maize/pigeonpea intercrop (MZPP), continuous unfertilized maize (MZ-MZ), and fertilized maize (MZ+F). Total N accumulated by cropping system was in the order GNPP > PP > MZPP > GN at 180, 130, 103 and 87 kg N/ha respectively. In the groundnut/ pigeonpea intercrop, despite a reduction of pigeonpea biomass, pigeonpea was still the main driver for N cycling in the systems. The average percentage of N derived from BNF (BNF-N%) from all plant components and across sites was 66% for groundnut and 52% for pigeonpea. Average maize grain yield for response years when rotated with legumes was 4.82, 3.25, and 2.16 Mg/ha for sites with high (Linthipe), medium (Kandeu), and low (Golomoti) agricultural productivity potential. System performance in terms of gross margins ranged from $1145 (pigeonpea-maize rotation) to $1407/ha (groundnut/pigeonpea-maize rotation). The pigeonpea-maize rotation produced the most biomass but had modest economic and agronomic returns during the legume phase. This study highlighted that, for hot and dry environments, groundnut was the most effective species at increasing maize yield in a subsequent year. The groundnut/pigeonpea-maize rotation system met multiple goals including high pigeonpea biomass, profitable groundnut grain, and high maize yields during the rotational year. This system is recommended for ecological intensification, as it provided an economically feasible means to enhance BNF on smallholder farms, while ensuring multiple grain harvest goals in different environmental contexts."

We discovered serendipitously an effective control method for the weed that involves intercropping cereals with the fodder legume, silverleaf desmodium, Desmodium uncinatum (Jacq.) DC., through mechanisms that involve soil shading and nitrogen fixation. In the current study we investigated long-term effects of inorganic nitrogen (N), mulching and D. uncinatum, singly and in combinations, on S. hermonthica infestation, maize plant growth and grain yields. Treatments comprised sole maize with and without 120 kg N/ha; sole maize plots covered with maize straw (i.e. mulching), with and without N; and maize-D. uncinatum intercrop, with and without N. Intercropping maize with D. uncinatum gave the most significant suppression of S. hermonthica, with addition of N only minimally enhancing its effect. Similarly, mulching significantly suppressed S. hermonthica, although to a much less extent. Application of N both to sole maize and mulched plots reduced seasonal S. hermonthica infestations but the effect was largely insignificant. The effect of D. uncinatum was again notable as it dramatically increased maize plant height and grain yields, with the addition of N only minimally improving both effects. Application of N and mulch, singly and in combination, to the sole maize crop generally enhanced plant height and grain yields, although to a less extent, with the effect of N on grain yields being statistically insignificant during most of the cropping seasons. These results confirm the efficacy of D. uncinatum in S. hermonthica suppression leading to better growth and yields of maize. The effects of N application, mulching and a combination of both treatments in S. hermonthica control in maize were also observed, although these effects were much weaker. The results and their implications are discussed in the context of smallholder cropping systems in the region. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."	"[Midega, Charles A.

This also occurs with green cowpea grain, which is much appreciated in the north and northeast of the country. The aim of this study was to identify maize and cowpea cultivars that can be grown as monocrops or intercrops to produce green grain in the state of Para (PA). An experiment was carried out in a randomized block design with six replications in Maraba, PA. Monocrops of traditional varieties of the cowpea ('Corujinha' and 'Sempre Verde') and the maize cultivars ('AG 1051' and 'AL Bandeirante'), and four alternating, intercropped rows of a combination of the varieties and cultivars were evaluated. The 'AG 1051' cultivar was more productive than the 'AL Bandeirante' cultivar, as both a monocrop and an intercrop. The cowpea cultivars showed a similar performance under both systems of cultivation. There was no interaction between the maize cultivars and cowpea cultivars. The monocrops were superior to the intercrops for green-ear, green-pod and green-grain yield. Considering the land equivalent ratio, if the aim is to produce green pods, intercropping is only beneficial in the AG 1051 + Corujnha combination. If the aim is for green-grain yield in the cowpea, intercropping is more advantageous when the 'AG 1051' cultivar is combined with any cowpea cultivar. The intercrop including the 'AL Bandeirante' cultivar is only beneficial with the 'Corujinha' cultivar, and if the aim is to market unhusked, green ears of maize.

Soil conservation through intercropping or crop canopy management is widely accepted as one of the ways of diversifying crop yields in rainfed agriculture in sloping landscapes. Field experiments were conducted between 2009 and 2014 to evaluate the effects of one or two rows of cowpea/okra intercropped with maize (planted either in 90 or 150 cm row spacing) on productivity, profitability, and resource conservation on 4% sloping crop land in the Himalayas. During five years of experimentation, a total of 110 runoff events were observed in the maize crop grown in rainy months of June to September. The results showed that by growing one row of cowpea in between two rows of maize (90 x 20 cm), no effect was observed on the productivity of rainfed maize. Productivity of the succeeding wheat crop was enhanced by 13% which resulted in a higher net return (117 US$ ha(-1)) than in a maize -wheat system. This system also reduced runoff and soil loss by 26% and 43%, respectively, compared to only a maize cropping system. Regression analysis revealed as runoff in maize crop increases, grain yield of succeeding rainfed wheat crop decreases due to the less availability of soil moisture.	"[Sharma, N.

Moench] and maize (Zea mays L.) production in southern Honduras is a lepidopterous complex. The objective of this study was to apply economic analysis to sorghum production and insect pest management strategies. Whole plant samples were taken of sorghum and maize in an on-farm study to determine insect pest densities, plant damage, and yield in plots managed under different planting dates, weed management, and insecticide application treatment systems in 1996. An economic analysis was conducted on the production systems applying direct and fixed costs and income in an appropriate model. The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), was the most prevalent species; two other armyworm species, Metaponpneumata rogenhoferi (Moschler) and S. latifascia (Walker), were present only early in the season; and a grass looper, Mocis latipes (Guenee), was present in mid- to late season. The lepidopterous population density was kept under crop damaging levels and yield was increased when Semevin(R) (thiodicarb) insecticide was used as a seed protectant in combination with delayed planting date (five days after the beginning of the rainy season), delayed weed control (two to three weeks after crop emergence), and application of Lannate(R) (methomyl) insecticide as soon as eggs or first instar larvae were observed on the crop plants. Increased levels of technology input into the intercropped production system increased sorghum production by 49% and maize production by 26% in this on-farm study. This increase in yield may be translated to an increase in farm net return of 58% and 15% for sorghum and maize, respectively."

However, there are limited data on the underlying mechanisms of soil-bornePhytophthoradisease suppression. Here, a field experiment confirmed the effects of maize and soybean intercropping onPhytophthorablight of soybean caused byPhytophthora sojae. Experimentally, the roots and root exudates of maize were found to attractP. sojaezoospores and inhibit their motility and the germination of cystospores. Furthermore, five phenolic acids (p-coumaric acid, cinnamic acid,p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, and ferulic acid) that were consistently identified in the root exudates and rhizosphere soil of maize were found to interfere with the infection behavior ofP. sojae. Among them, cinnamic acid was associated with significant chemotaxis in zoospores, andp-coumaric acid and cinnamic acid showed strong antimicrobial activity againstP. sojae. However, in the rhizosphere soil of soybean, onlyp-hydroxybenzoic acid, low concentrations of vanillic acid, and ferulic acid were identified. Importantly, the coexistence of five phenolic acids in the maize rhizosphere compared with three phenolic acids in the soybean rhizosphere showed strong synergistic antimicrobial activity against the infection behavior ofP. sojae. In summary, the types and concentrations of phenolic acids in maize and soybean rhizosphere soils were found to be crucial factors forPhytophthoradisease suppression in this intercropping system.

Previous studies have focused on the description of recovery growth, but the physiological changes and water use assessment during the recovery growth period remain unclear. A field experiment was conducted in Yangling, Shaanxi province, China during the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 growing seasons to investigate maize physiological characteristics, root morphology, and transpiration efficiency during the recovery growth period. Three cropping systems (sole wheat, sole maize, wheat/maize intercropping) and two water treatments (supplementary irrigation and rainfed) were evaluated. Wheat was more competitive than maize during the intercropping co-growth period. During the co-growth period, the aboveground dry matter of intercropped wheat was 20.1 %-37.8 % greater than for sole wheat and water consumption was 14.9 %-15.9 greater than for sole wheat. However, plant height and aboveground dry matter of intercropped maize during the co-growth period were less than for sole maize. Total root length of intercropped maize under supplementary irrigation initially exhibited rapid growth after wheat harvest, especially in the border rows. Subsequently, aboveground dry matter showed recovery growth, with final aboveground dry matter (2-yr average) of border rows and inner rows being 1 % and 4.5 %, respectively, greater than sole maize dry matter. Relative chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate of intercropped maize were 4.3 %-19.2 % and 1.7 %-15.9 %, respectively, higher than observed for sole maize under irrigated conditions. Transpiration efficiency of intercropped maize during the recovery period was 10 % and 50.9 % greater than observed for sole maize under irrigated conditions in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Some recovery growth did occur under rainfed conditions, but it did not completely compensate for the growth reduction that occurred during the co-growth period. Supplementary irrigation promoted recovery growth of intercropped maize. Recovery growth improves intercropped maize grain yield and efficient use of water resources.

Maize grown with potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) in normal (1 : 1) and paired row planting (2 : 2) reduced the weed population, their dry weight and increased the weed-smothering efficiency of crop canopy (66.10 and 60.59% respectively). Maize intercropped with potato was more advantageous than French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and significantly improved all the yield attributes as well as yield of component crops and finally recorded significantly higher maize-equivalent yield (12.30 and 12.02 tonnes/ha) than normal (1 : 2) and paired planting (2 : 4) of maize with French bean (9.81 and 9.65 tonnes/ha). On an average, maize intercropped with potato under normal and paired planting systems, recorded 20.69 and 18.89% higher maize-equivalent yield than normal and paired row maize with French bean. Although gross return was more with maize + potato, the net return and net return per rupee investment were higher in maize + French bean. The higher level of fertilizer resulted in significant increase in all the yield attributes and yield of component crops and ultimately the maize-equivalent yield. Net return was significantly higher with 100% fertilizer dose but the net return per rupee of investment was higher with 75% dose. Weedy ecosystem registered a yield reduction of 29.63, 26.79 and 38.85% in maize, potato and French bean respectively. Significantly higher maize-equivalent yield was recorded under hand-weeding and pendimethalin-treated plots than weedy check. Chemical weeding recorded significantly higher net return per rupee of investment.

The different planting times were simultaneous planting of maize and cowpea (0) and subsequent interplanting of cowpea at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after planting (WAP) maize. The ratios of cowpea:maize population was also varied. The population of Clavigralla tomentosicollis Stal., Riptortus dentipes Fab., Anoplocnemis curvipes Fab., Mirperus jaculus W. and Nezara viridula L. was significantly less on cowpea in the 4 and 6 WAP treatments., but yield in these treatments was also reduced compared to all other treatments. There was a significantly lower population of bugs (P < 0.05) on the cowpea crop when grown at 25:75 and 50:50 cowpea:maize ratios but the yield was greatest at the 50:50 ratio.

Production potential, biological feasibility and economic viability of maize (Zea mays)-based intercropping systems under rainfed conditions of Kashmir valley	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						"Competition functions; Intercropping; Maize; Pulses; Soil fertility"		A field experiment was conducted during the rainy (kharif) seasons of 2006 and 2007 at the Regional Research Station, Wadura. Sopore (Jammu and Kashmir) to evaluate the production potential, biological feasibility and economic viability of intercropping of maize [Zea mays (L.)] with frenchbean [Vigna vulgaris (L.)], cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp], soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] and greengram [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek] under 2-row proportions (1:1 and 2:2). The grain yield of sole maize was higher than the intercropping but the total grain equivalent yield of maize was highest (4.87 tonnes/ha) in maize + frenchbean (2:2) intercropping system. Intercropping of maize with frenchbean in 2:2 row proportion gave maximum monetary advantage (Rs 6 586/ha), net returns (Rs 16 462/ha), income-equivalent ratio (1.38) and benefit : cost ratio (1.96) over other intercropping systems. This treatment accounted for maximum land-equivalent ratio (1.36), product of relative crowding co-efficient (K>8.99) and area-time equivalent ratio (1.32) and also indicated a modest competitive ratio (2.16 : 0.47) and aggressivity factor (+/- 0.97) Which proved the most efficient system. Intercropping increased available soil N and decreased both soil P and K compared to initial and available soil N, P and K content after sole maize at both the systems of sowing. Available soil N, P and K content varied with the kind of intercrops. However maize+soybean, followed by maize+cowpea system recorded the highest available soil N, P and K among various intercropping system.

This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying niche complementarity to increase P acquisition in the maize/alfalfa mixture by influencing root/rhizosphere interactions. Maize was grown alone (single maize) or with maize (maize/maize) or alfalfa (maize/alfalfa) with low P (30 mg P kg(-1)soil) and high P (150 mg P kg(-1)soil) supplies. The target maize had greater shoot biomass and P content when grown with alfalfa than maize. Compared with maize, alfalfa had higher secretion of carboxylates and acid phosphatase, suggesting a stronger capacity to mobilize soil P. Phosphorus deficiency also increased the specific root length and the proportion of thin roots (diameter < 0.2 mm) in alfalfa, and intercropped alfalfa had higher carboxylates secretion than monocropped one, indicating that alfalfa root traits were modified by both soil P supply and the identity of neighbor. Increased soil P availability by alfalfa root exudation and improved rhizosphere environment by thin alfalfa roots promoted shoot growth and P acquisition of maize in the maize/alfalfa mixture. The presence of maize increased the secretion of carboxylates from alfalfa roots, suggesting that the root interactions between maize and alfalfa are crucial for improving P-use efficiency and productivity in intercropping.

In this study, we analyzed the effects of legume intercropping and nitrogen (N) fertilizer level on net greenhouse gas balances (NGHGB), yield-based greenhouse gas emissions intensity (GHGI), carbon footprint (CF) and crop productivity in sweet maize cropland in South China based on a long-term field experiment during 2013-2018. Results demonstrated that the sweet maize/soybean intercropping pattern could improve crop productivity on the unit of arable land, but the yield advantage of the intercropping system was totally derived from the soybean. Accordingly, the intercropping pattern reduced the GHGI with significant difference compared to the sweet maize mono-cropping system. Therein, the difference between the sweet maize/soybean intercropping with crop line ratios of 2:3 (S2B3) and 2:4 (S2B4) were not significant. Furthermore, suitable N input during the sweet maize cultivation in the region were necessary for improving the crop productivity and decreasing the GHGs emission in farmland. Also, the difference of N levels was significant to the GHGs emissions, soil organic carbon sequestration, GHGI and NGHGB. The 300 kg N ha(-1) showed the better effect for lowering the NGHGB and CF in sweet maize farmland when keeping crop productivity. The interaction effect of the N level and crop pattern just showed on the crop yields and GHGI. The S2B4 with 300 kg N ha(-1) showed significant benefits with respect to maintaining the yields and reducing the net GHGs emissions compared to conventional sweet maize farming system in the Pearl River Delta in China. These advanced agricultural practices contributed to the development of clean agricultural production in China.

Performance of semi-determinate and indeterminate cowpeas relay-cropped into maize in Northeast Nigeria	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						"Cowpea; maize; grain; relay-intercropping; savanna; northeast Nigeria"	"INTERCROPPED COWPEA; YIELD"	Field trials were conducted in 2005 and 2006 in Tilla (northern Guinea savanna) and Sabon-Gari (Sudan savanna) in northeast Nigeria to determine the performance of two improved cowpea varieties when relay-intercropped with early and late maize, 6 and 8 weeks after planting the maize. Grain yield, number of branches and number of pods per plant were higher for the variety IT89KD-288 than for IT97K-499-35, whether planted sole or relay-intercropped with maize. Grain yield was lower for IT97K-499-35 than for IT89KD-288 when relay-intercropped with maize irrespective of the maturity period of the companion maize crop. This may be due to the indeterminate growth habit and shade tolerance of IT89KD-288 which allowed a higher pod load than IT97K-499-35. However, relay-intercropping with early maize gave higher yield than relay-intercropping into late maize. Also relay-intercropping at 6 weeks after planting maize (WAP) gave a higher yield than relay-intercropping at 8 WAP. This therefore, suggests that introducing cowpea into short statured early maize may mean less competition for light and soil resources compared to taller late maize. Also introducing the cowpea earlier may allow the crop to make full use of soil moisture during the cropping season.	"[Kamara, A. Y.; Ewansiha, S.

Knowledge on optimal maize plant density is lacking from perspective of dry matter accumulation among organs in this intercropping system. We quantified the effect of maize plant density on relative yield total (RYT), maize and peanut yields, and maize dry matter of organs (ears, leaves, and stems) in maize/peanut intercropping. Field experiments were conducted in a semi-arid area of China in 2015 and 2016. Three maize plant densities (6, 9 and 12 plants m(-2)) were tested in maize/peanut intercropping (per unit growing area designed for maize) and sole systems, whereas the plant density of intercropped peanut and sole peanut was fixed as 24 plants m(-2). The beta and logistic growth functions were used to quantitatively characterize the dynamics of dry matter allocation among organs in maize. Increasing maize plant density significantly increased maize yield gain, but not increased peanut yield loss, in maize/peanut intercropping. The greatest yield advantage (RYTs of 1.21 in 2015 and 1.13 in 2016) occured in maize/peanut intercropping with maize planted at 9 plants m(-2). Increasing plant density increased leaf growth rate, but reduced leaf longevity and dry matter allocation to ears for maize grown in both intercropping and sole systems. But, greater increases in leaf growth rate and leaf longevity for intercropped maize compared with sole maize resulted in a greater increase in dry matter accumulation for maize grown at 9 and 12 plants m(-2). Greater increases in ear dry matter accumulation and yield were found for maize grown at 9 plants m(-2) due to greater dry matter allocation to ears. We conclude that the different responses to plant density of the source capacity (leaves) and sink strength (ears) for maize in intercropping and sole systems could help optimize maize plant density (9 plants m(-2)) for greater maize yield gain and yield advantage in maize/peanut intercropping.

Twenty-six intercropping trials were conducted on farmers' fields with the following experimental treatments: sole maize crop cropping (MS), maize-Brachiariaintercropping (MB) and maize-pigeon pea intercropping (MP). The trials were managed by the farmers, i.e. choice of conventional tillage (CT) versus no-tillage (NT), sowing dates, fertilization and weed control. Maize grain yield varied strongly across the farmer fields, from 100 to 5900 kg ha(-1)in the MS treatment, 500 to 6900 kg ha(-1) in MP and 300 to 5500 kg ha(-1)in MB. Intercropping did not significantly affect maize grain yields under NT, but yields were reduced under CT in one out of two seasons. Maize yields in the intercropped systems were also higher under NT than CT. Total biomass productivity was significantly higher in the maize-fodder than in the sole maize system. An increased interval between sowing of maize and fodder crop significantly reduced the fodder crop biomass. Relay intercropping, especially in combination with NT, is a promising option if crop calendars and fertilization are properly managed by farmers to reduce interspecific competition between the maize and fodder crop.

Cultivation of maize intercropped with pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L. Millsp.) is common in some areas of eastern and southern Africa. The objectives of this study were (1) to investigate dry matter, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) accumulation in different plant components of maize-pigeonpea intercropping systems and (2) to report the effects of the intercrops on soil fertility. Maize-pigeonpea intercrops were compared to sole maize grown using farmers' practices. Intercropping maize and pigeonpea increased (P < 0.05) total system yield compared to sole maize in terms of biomass, N and P accumulation. Pigeonpea planted in maize did not reduce (P < 0.05) the accumulation of dry matter, N nor P in the maize grain. The harvest indices of maize, calculated on basis dry matter, N or P did not differ either (P < 0.05). Total soil C and N contents and inorganic N content, nitrate and ammonium, were not affected by two seasons of maize-pigeonpea intercropping compared to sole maize (P > 0.11). Nitrate and ammonium levels in soil were still not affected by the treatments after the soils were incubated in anaerobic conditions for 8 days at 37 degrees C (P > 0.11). However, pigeonpea added up to 60 kg of N ha(-1) to the system and accumulated up to 6 kg of P ha(-1) and only 25% of this N and P were exported in the grain. In conclusion, beside the added grain yield of pigeonpea in the intercropped systems, pigeonpea increased the recirculation of dry matter, N and P, which may have a long-term effect on soil fertility. Furthermore, the stems from pigeonpea contributed to household fuel wood consumption. The intercropped system thus had multiple benefits that gave significant increase in combined yield per unit area without additional labour requirements. The main requirement in order to up-scale the maize-pigeonpea intercropping approach is sufficient supply of high-quality pigeonpea seeds.

Effects of intercropping and fertilizer application on the yield and nutritive value of maize and amaranth forages in Nigeria	GRASS AND FORAGE SCIENCE			English	Article						"intercropping; fertilizer; maize; amaranth; forage; sheep; dry season"	CORN	Maize and amaranth forages, produced during the wet season, have the potential to bridge the gap in forage supply to ruminants during the dry season in Nigeria. In two growing seasons (2006 and 2007), effects of intercropping and fertilizer application on dry matter (DM) yield and chemical composition of forages, and land use efficiency, were studied in two experiments. The digestibility of sun-dried or ensiled maize, amaranth or maize-amaranth mixtures was measured using West African dwarf sheep in a third experiment. Maize showed a higher response to fertilizer application than amaranth or maize-amaranth mixtures. With fertilizer application, DM yield varied significantly (P < 0 center dot 05) between species and intercropped mixtures. Dry matter yield ranged from 7 center dot 1 (amaranth) to 12 center dot 6 t ha-1 (maize) in 2006 and 6 center dot 9 (amaranth) to 11 center dot 3 t ha-1 (70:30 maize-amaranth population mixture) in 2007. Crude protein (CP) concentration of whole plants ranged from 99 center dot 0 (maize) to 227 center dot 0 g kg-1 DM (amaranth). Dry matter digestibility values of sun-dried maize, sun-dried maize:amaranth 50:50 mixture, sun-dried amaranth, ensiled maize, ensiled maize:amaranth 50:50 mixture and ensiled amaranth were 0 center dot 718, 0 center dot 607, 0 center dot 573, 0 center dot 737, 0 center dot 553 and 0 center dot 526 respectively. Intercropping increased forage yield and land use efficiency compared to amaranth but had no yield advantage over maize. Although DM digestibility of maize was higher than that of amaranth or the maize:amaranth mixture, digestible CP yield ha-1 was higher with amaranth in the cropping mixture, showing that amaranth could complement maize in systems where CP is the limiting factor to livestock production.

In addition, nodulating soybean and nonnodulating soybean were each monocropped and grown as a mixture. In 1985 and 1986, treatments were grown at 0 nad 60 kg N ha-1 and in 1988, the treatments were grown without N fertilizer, on N-depeted soil and on non-N-depleted soil. N-15 enriched N was applied to soil in all the aforementional treatments to test for N transfer from nodulating soybean to non-N2-fixing crops by the N-15 dilution method. The N-15 dilution method did not show the occurrence of N transfer in 1985 and 1986, but the N sparing effect was evident from the total N uptake of nonnodulating soybean, dwarf maize and tall maize, in 1986. In 1988, maize and nonnodulating soybean seed yields and seed N yields were higher on non-N-depleted soil than on N-depleted soil. On N-depleted soil, the N-15 dilution method indicated N transfer from nodulating soybean to maize and to nonndulating soybean. At a population ratio of 67% nodulating soybean to 33% nonnodulating soybean, N transfer was also seen on non-N-depleted soil in 1988.

AND ON THEIR UPTAKE BY MAIZE	JOURNAL OF ELEMENTOLOGY			English	Article						"maize; strip cropping; copper; zinc; content; uptake"	"SOIL; SYSTEMS; CORN"	"Strip intercropping is the practice of growing two or more species of plants in strips wide enough for independent mechanical cultivation, yet narrow enough to allow interaction between the species. This can affect not only crop yield but also competition in the uptake of nutrients and thus the chemical composition of the plants. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of strip intercropping and three methods of weed control on the content of zinc and copper in maize and on uptake of these components by maize. The study was conducted in 2004-2006 on a private farm located in the village of Frankamionka in the administrative district (powiat) of Zamosc. It was based on a field experiment conducted on clayey silt soil with grain-size distribution of clay and a moderate Zn and Cu content. The experiment design was a split-plot randomized complete block in four replications. The factors taken into account were two methods of cultivation: sole cropping and strip cropping (common bean, dent maize, and spring wheat in adjacent strips) and three methods of weed control: mechanical - weeding of interrows twice; mechanical-chemical the herbicide Gesaprim 90 WG 1.5 kg ha(-1) + weeding of interrows once; and chemical the herbicides Gesaprim 90 WG 1.5 kg ha(-1) + Milagro 040 SC 1.5 L ha(-1). Fodder maize was grown for silage and harvested during milky-wax maturity. The content of copper and zinc in the dry matter of maize was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) after digestion in HNO3 (extra pure) in accordance with PN-EN ISO 6869:2002. On average for the experiment, strip cropping of maize with common bean and spring wheat reduced zinc content in maize, but in successive years of the study, the impact of the cultivation methods was varied. Strip cropping significantly increased the copper content in the plants in comparison with sole cropping. Zn and Cu content varied depending on the location of a row in strip cropping. Location adjacent to a strip of beans was more favourable to zinc accumulation in the biomass of maize, while copper content was the highest in maize plants from rows adjacent to wheat, and lowest when grown next to a bean strip. Strip cropping significantly decreased zinc uptake by maize, but the influence of cropping methods on copper uptake was not significant. The uptake of zinc and copper was the highest when the chemical weed control method was used, and resulted mainly from the high biomass of maize. The results confirm the impact of strip cropping on competition. in the uptake of nutrients and on their content and total uptake."

Assessment of conservation agriculture and intercropping practices for enhanced productivity and profitability in maize (Zea mays)	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						"Intercropped maize; Nutrient uptake; Weed population; Zero-tillage plus residue"	NITROGEN	A field experiment was conducted to study the effect of tillage and intercropping on yield, net returns and weed density in maize (Zea mays L.) at ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi during 2010, 2011 and 2012. The experiment was conducted in split-plot design with three replications. In main plots, tillage systems, viz. conventional tillage (CT), CT + residues at 3 t/ha, zero-tillage (ZT) and ZT+residues at 3 t/ha were taken. In sub plots, intercropping systems such as sole maize, sole groundnut, maize + groundnut (1:1) and maize + groundnut (1:2) were taken. The results indicated that ZT + residue at 3 t/ha recorded the highest dry matter (DM) accumulation in maize at all the growth stages except 30 DAS followed by CT + residue at 3 t/ha over the years. The yield attributes such as number of gain rows/cob and number of grains/grain row were recorded highest in ZT + residue at 3 t/ha followed by CT + residue at 3 t/ha. The residue retention at 3 t/ha in ZT enhanced 25.3-28.9% grain yield in maize compared to CT over the years. ZT + residue at 3 t/ha recorded the highest net returns (49.8 x 10(3) (sic)/ha) and B:C ratios (1.7) in maize. In 2010, weed population of broad-leaved weed (BLWs), narrow-leaved weed (NLWs) and total was recorded highest in ZT + residue at 3 t/ha. However, the population of BLWs and total increased in CT compared to ZT at the end of the study period. The intercropped system, viz. maize + groundnut in 1:1 and 1:2 recorded the lowest DM accumulation than the sole maize over the years. The number of grain rows/cob and number of grains/grain row were recorded highest in sole maize compared to intercropped maize. However, higher grain yield and net returns was found in maize + groundnut in 1:1 and 1:2 than sole maize. The intercropped maize + groundnut in 1:1 and 1:2 recorded the lowest population of BLWs, NLWs and total during the years.	"[Sepat, Seema; Bana, R. S.; Meena, S. L.; Rana, D.

Indeed, peanut/maize intercropping reportedly improves the iron nutrition of peanuts in calcareous soils. The limited evidence available suggests that the improved Fe nutrition in intercropping is largely attributable to a rhizosphere effect of maize. In this study, the effects of peanut/maize intercropping on the Fe nutritional status of peanut associated with the dynamics of the rhizosphere processes and Fe uptake gene expression induced by the interaction of the two species at various growth days were investigated. The results suggest that an interspecific rhizosphere effect improves Fe nutrition in peanut, as shown by changes in the rhizosphere available Fe concentration, pH, and Olsen-P concentration, based on time-course changes in peanut maize interaction. The increase in available Fe in the rhizosphere of peanut ranged from 0.2 to 2.64 mg kg(-1). The transition from the vegetative to reproductive stage was a key turning point in the time-course of changes in the rhizosphere processes in intercropping. There was more consistently positive effect of intercropping on peanut Fe nutrition after 53 days. Moreover, the expression of AhFRO1 and AhYSL1 was expressed at significantly higher level in intercropped peanuts compared to monocropped peanut at the vegetative stage, indicating a role for these genes in Fe improvement in intercropped peanuts. We conclude that the enhanced time-course changes in the rhizosphere processes and iron uptake gene expression with a consistent positive interspecific effect appear to be one of the mechanisms underlying the improved Fe nutrition in intercropped peanut plants.

It provides food security and early access to income from the maize component. However, yields of both crops are commonly low in farmers' fields. Multi-locational trials were conducted in Southern Nigeria in 2016 and 2017 to investigate options to increase productivity and profitability through increased cassava and maize plant densities and fertilizer application. Trials with 4 and 6 treatments in 2016 and 2017, respectively were established on 126 farmers' fields over two seasons with a set of different designs, including combinations of two levels of crop density and three levels of fertilizer rates. The maize crop was tested at low density (LM) with 20,000 plants ha(-1) versus high density (HM) with 40,000 plants ha(-1). For cassava, low density (LC) had had 10,000 plants ha(-1) versus the high density (HC) with 12,500 plants ha(-1).; The fertilizer application followed a regime favouring either the maize crop (FM: 90 kg N, 20 kg P and 37 kg K ha(-1)) or the cassava crop (FC: 75 kg N, 20 kg P and 90 kg K ha(-1)), next to control without fertilizer application (F0). Higher maize density (HM) increased marketable maize cob yield by 14 % (3700 cobs ha(-1)) in the first cycle and by 8% (2100 cobs ha(-1)) in the second cycle, relative to the LM treatment. Across both cropping cycles, fertilizer application increased cob yield by 15 % (5000 cobs ha(-1)) and 19 % (6700 cobs ha(-1)) in the FC and FM regime, respectively. Cassava storage root yield increased by 16 % (4 Mg ha(-1)) due to increased cassava plant density, and by 14 % (4 Mg ha(-1)) due to fertilizer application (i.e., with both fertilizer regimes) but only in the first cropping cycle. In the second cycle, increased maize plant density (HM) reduced cassava storage root yield by 7% (1.5 Mg ha(-1)) relative to the LM treatment. However, the negative effect of high maize density on storage root yield was counteracted by fertilizer application. Fresh storage root yield increased by 8% (2 Mg ha(-1)) in both fertilizer regimes compared to the control without fertilizer application. Responses to fertilizer by cassava and maize varied between fields. Positive responses tended to decline with increasing yields in the control treatment. The average value-to-cost ratio (VCR) of fertilizer use for the FM regime was 3.6 and higher than for the FC regime (VCR = 1.6), resulting from higher maize yields when FM than when FC was applied. Revenue generated by maize constituted 84-91% of the total revenue of the cropping system. The highest profits were achieved with the FM regime when both cassava and maize were grown at high density. However, fertilizer application was not always advisable as 34 % of farmers did not realize a profit. For higher yields and profitability, fertilizer recommendations should be targeted to responsive fields based on soil fertility knowledge."

The experiment was conducted during wet season of 2016 and 2017 at ICAR-National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, Haryana (India). Results indicated that significantly higher green fodder yield was recorded with monocropped maize with application of 75%RDF+Zn+PGPR+FYM and 100%RDF+Zn+FYM which remained statistically similar with maize and cowpea intercropped in 2M:1C ratio with application of 75%RDF+Zn+PGPR+FYM. Maize and cowpea intercropped in 1M:1C ratio recorded 20.4% higher crude protein (CP) yield over monocropped maize. The maize planted under 1M:1C ratio showed significantly higher macro and micronutrients content over monocropped. Furthermore, the maize and cowpea sown under 1M:1C ratio with application of 75%RDF+Zn+PGPR+FYM or 100%RDF+Zn+FYM also showed significantly higher nutrient uptake (macro and micronutrients) over remaining treatments. Therefore, intercropping of maize and cowpea in 1M:1C ratio with application of 75%RDF+Zn+PGPR+FYM or 100%RDF+Zn+FYM could be recommended to enhance forage productivity, nutrient uptake and also help in curtailing the external demand of protein by augmenting on farm protein production.

Mixtures were composed of cultivars with Arabische (gene Mla12), Laevigatum (MI(La)), and Monte Cristo (Mla9) resistance, respectively. The three-way mixtures were either random or, in 1989, laid out as one-row mixtures (i.e., regularly alternating rows of different genotypes) or three-row mixtures (i.e., regularly alternating three-row strips of different genotypes), respectively. In 1990 only random mixtures and six-row mixtures were compared with pure stands. The virulence complexity (i.e., the average number of virulence factors per isolate with reference to Mla12, MI(La), and Mla9) was always maximal in the random mixtures. In 1989, linear regression of complexity on mildew generations gave significant b-values (slopes) of 0.049, 0.031, and 0.025 in the random mixture, one-row mixture, and three-row mixture, respectively; the b-value from pure stands was not significant. In 1990, another sampling technique allowed selection to be observed on each genotype in the mixtures separately. In the random mixture b-values were 0. 048, 0.064 and 0.017 (not significant) on Mla12, MI(La), and Mla9 cultivars respectively. In six-row mixtures and in pure stands, there was no significant increase in complexity (b > 0) on any of the mixture components. Although the frequency and relative fitness of complex pathotypes were higher in all types of mixtures than in pure stands, selection towards complex races was much less intense in row mixtures than in random mixtures in both field trials."

The objectives of this study were to (i) investigate the yield variability of maize (Zea mays L.) cultivars and populations in mixtures, (ii) evaluate the competitiveness of maize cultivars, and (iii) evaluate the relationship between competitiveness and grain yield. A 2-yr (2012-2013) field experiment was conducted using the de Wit replacement series design. Two maize cultivars, Yedan13 (YD13) and Zhong-dan909 (ZD909), were grown in seven different YD13/ZD909 combinations (0:6, 1:5, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 5:1, and 6:0) with a plant density of 67,500 plants ha(-1). Yield variability was observed on individual plant and population levels in different mixtures of both maize cultivars. Grain and dry matter yield per plant for each cultivar and population level decreased as the proportion of YD13 increased, and grain yield per plant was always lowest for YD13. However, the relative yield (RY) of YD13 was higher than that of ZD909 in all mixtures. Analyses of competition indices (RY, aggressivity, and relative severity of competition) indicated that YD13 was more competitive than ZD909. These results demonstrated that maize cultivars differ in their competitiveness. In addition, enhanced competitive pressure was accompanied by a reduction in yield performance. These results suggest a negative relationship between maize competitiveness and grain yield.

However, the responses of indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) diversity and communities in rhizosphere soil and roots to intercropping systems with different nitrogen application rates remain unclear. In this study, a field experiment was conducted with split-plot design, and AMF communities in crop rhizosphere soil and roots in monoculture and intercropping systems treated with different levels of nitrogen fertilization were investigated using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Nitrogen fertilization significantly decreased the AMF alpha-diversity in maize rhizosphere soil, and no significant differences were observed between monocultured and intercropped maize. The Shannon index of soybean rhizosphere soil was significantly higher in intercropping treatments than in monoculture treatments for the corresponding nitrogen levels. The AMF diversity in the roots of maize showed different trends to those in the soil. The dominant genera in the present study were Glomusj Glomeraceae, Paragtomus, and Gigaspora, which occupied 55.52%, 9.18%, and 8.20% of the rhizosphere soil and 6535%, 5.32%, and 17.16% of the roots, respectively. Our study showed that the abundance of the dominant genus, Glomus_f_Glomeraceae in maize soil and roots significantly increased in intercropping treatments compared with monoculture treatments, and it also increased with the increase in nitrogen application levels. In soybean soil and roots, the abundance of Glomus_j_Glomeraceae decreased with the increase in nitrogen application levels. The results of the redundancy and correlations analyses indicated that the changes in the AMF diversity and community in intercropping areas were significantly associated with alterations of the soil total nitrogen and alkali-hydrolysable nitrogen due to the interactions between maize and soybeans in intercropping systems with different nitrogen fertilizer application rates.

Conservation tillage and production systems that aim to maximize soil and water use in a sustainable form have become alternatives for regions that have relatively short periods of rain and high temperature. The objective of this research was to evaluate intercropping systems with maize and Brachiaria that have better adaptation to the edaphoclimatic conditions of the Zona da Mata region, state of Alagoas. The treatments consisted of a BRS 3150 hybrid of maize, Cultivated ill the following systems: Conventional Cropping, Minimum Cultivation and No-tillage (BRS 3150 intercropped with Brachiaria decumbens). The design used was randomized block with subdivided plots. Soil samples were collected for chemical analysis. Production components and grain yield were also evaluated. The different soil managements and the use of Brachiaria decumbens ill an intercropping system with maize did not affect production components. The result analysis allowed the conclusion that the use of Brachiaria decumbens had a negative influence on maize yield when cultivated in an intercropping system, with the higher yield obtained ill conservations systems.

The contribution of phenotypic plasticity to complementary light capture in plant mixtures	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Article						"architectural model; community structure; complementary light capture; net biodiversity effect; phenotypic plasticity; wheat-maize intercrop"	"FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; PRODUCTIVITY; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; MODEL; VARIABILITY; ENVIRONMENT; COMPETITION; UNDERSTAND; SIMULATION"	Interspecific differences in functional traits are a key factor for explaining the positive diversity-productivity relationship in plant communities. However, the role of intraspecific variation attributable to phenotypic plasticity in diversity-productivity relationships has largely been overlooked. By taking a wheat (Triticum aestivum)-maize (Zea mays) intercrop as an elementary example of mixed vegetation, we show that plasticity in plant traits is an important factor contributing to complementary light capture in species mixtures. We conceptually separated net biodiversity effect into the effect attributable to interspecific trait differences and species distribution (community structure effect), and the effect attributable to phenotypic plasticity. Using a novel plant architectural modelling approach, whole-vegetation light capture was simulated for scenarios with and without plasticity based on empirical plant trait data. Light capture was 23% higher in the intercrop with plasticity than the expected value from monocultures, of which 36% was attributable to community structure and 64% was attributable to plasticity. For wheat, plasticity in tillering was the main reason for increased light capture, whereas for intercropped maize, plasticity induced a major reduction in light capture. The results illustrate the potential of plasticity for enhancing resource acquisition in mixed stands, and indicate the importance of plasticity in the performance of species-diverse plant communities.

Evaluation of Intercropping Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) with Maize under Different Plant Densities in Sandy Soils	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"Groundnut; Intercropping; Solid; Maize treatments; Plant densities; Seed yield; Pods yield; Sandy soils"	"ZEA-MAYS; YIELD; SYSTEMS; WHEAT"	"INTERCROPPING is the practice of growing two or more crops simultaneously on the same field to maximize total production per unit area. Intercropping is traditional practice in small holders especially at developing countries. The reason for this popularity is built on high profit and maximizing agriculture resources. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to evaluate the effect of intercropping maize with different plant densities on yield and yield components of groundnut to increase the productivity of groundnut under sandy soils. Two field trials were carried out at the experimental and research station at Ismailia of the Agriculture Research Center (ARC) during 2013 and 2014 summer seasons. Maize variety SC168 and groundnut C.V. Giza.6 were sown in the two seasons. The experimental design was a split-plot design with three replications; the main plots were assigned to three maize treatments (harvesting maize for grains, defoliation maize plants at 85 days from sowing maize and harvesting maize for silage). Three maize plant densities were distributed in sub plots by 2, 3 and 4 plants/hill at distance of 70 cm apart. Groundnut plants revealed that were sown in both sides of ridges (120 cm ridge width) by growing two plants per hill at 20 cm apart under intercropping and solid2 (as intercropping) , and solidi as recommended solid plant sowing. Results indicated that maize treatments, plant densities of maize and their interactions significantly affected groundnut characters. Removal maize plants for silage at 85 days or defoliation maize plants (at 85 days) increased light interception on groundnut plants which had a positive impact on the pod and seed yield of groundnut. Groundnut under intercropping with two maize plants per hill (50% of recommended density of maize) had the highest weight of seed per plant (13.18 and 12.78 g) and yield of pods per ha (2.16 and 2.09 ton) at 2013 and 2014 season, but four maize plants per hill (100% of recommended density of maize) caused significant reduction of seed yields per plant and pod yield per ha. According to this investigation, to gain high productivity of groundnut (2.50 and 2.32 t/ha, at 2013 and 2014 season), remove maize plants as silage (at 85 days) and / or growing two maize plants per hill (50%) under intercropping in sandy soil."

Since the whole plant maize has been known as energy source containing mainly carbohydrates, while protein is a limiting component, improving the protein source is one of the most stressed objective for crop production in Central Europe. At the same time sunflower and mainly soybean has been known as protein surce cultivars. That is why the possibility of maize based intercropping system with both sunflower and soybean was evaluated in 3-yr research program containing both field trial and chemical analysis or in situ digestibility for ruminants, carried out in Keszthely, Hungary. Since the findings of ideal harvest stage for forage sunflower are different, first of all time of harvest was investigated. According to both quantitative features or complex values, as digestible dry matter/protein yield, for whole plant sunflower, the flowering is the best harvest stage. During flowering, the ratio of head within the whole plant is increasing, and that for leaves and stalk with roughly to the same excent are decreasing. The feeding value of leaves was the same during the investigated period, two weeks before and one week after main flowering stage. In case of head it is increasing until main flowering stage and after this it is decreasing. Similar tendency was found in case of stalk, but the degree of increasing is much more moderate and that of decreasing deeper, than in case of head. Duration of harvest period for forage sunflower is very short; only 4-7 days. Large differences existed even if the earliest maize and the latest sunflower varieties and hybrids were investigated. The same was found in case of soybean. Consequently, sunflower and soybean are not suitable cultivars for maize intercropping in Hungary. At the same time, it has to be stressed, that in case of different sowing time. e. g. in different plots, it is possible to produce forage maize, sunflower or soybean and mix them before fermentation. That would be the only way to utilise the benefit of soybean and sunflower in improving the silage protein concentration. It could be especialy important in case of sunflower or soybean as second crop in the investigated area. These findings are useful to prepare a new technology for forage production."

However, little known is how to manage phosphorus (P) to enhance P use efficiency of the W/M/S system and to mitigate P leaching that is a major source of pollution. Field experiments were carried out in 2011, 2012, and 2013 to test the impact of five P application rates on yield and P use efficiency of the W/M/S system. The study measured grain yield, shoot P uptake, apparent P recovery efficiency (PRE) and soil P content. A linear-plateau model was used to determine the critical P rate that maximizes gains in the indexes of system productivity. The results show that increase in P application rates aggrandized shoot P uptake and crops yields at threshold rates of 70 and 71.5 kg P ha(-1) respectively. With P application rates increasing, the W/M/S system decreased the PRE from 35.9% to 12.3% averaged over the three years. A rational P application rate, 72 kg P ha(-1), or an appropriate soil Olsen-P level, 19.1 mg kg(-1), drives the W/M/S system to maximize total grain yield while minimizing P surplus, as a result of the PRE up to 28.0%. We conclude that rational P application is an important approach for relay intercropping to produce high yield while mitigating P pollution and the rational P application-based integrated P fertilizer management is vital for sustainable intensification of agriculture in the Southwest of China.

However, little is known about the fate of As fractions in the soil profile and As uptake within the intercropping plants under field condition. In this study, As removal, uptake, and translocation were investigated within an intercropping system of Pteris vittata L. (P. vittata) and maize (Zea mays). Results indicated that the concentration of As associated with amorphous Fe (hydr)oxides in the 10-20 cm soil layer was significantly lower under malposed intercropping of P. vittata and maize, and As accumulation in P. vittata and biomass of P. vittata were simultaneously higher under malposed intercropping than under coordinate intercropping, leading to a 2.4 times higher rate of As removal. Although maize roots absorbed over 13.4 mg kg(-1) As and maize leaves and flowers accumulated over 21.5 mg kg(-1) As (translocation factor higher than 1), grains produced in all inter cropping modes accumulated lower levels of As, satisfying the standard for human consumption. Our results suggested that malposed intercropping of a hyperaccumulator and a low-accumulation cash crop was an ideal planting pattern for As remediation in soil. Furthermore, timely harvest of P. vittata, agronomic strategies during remediation, and appropriate management of the above ground parts of P. vittata and high-As tissues of cash crops may further improve remediation efficiency.

The performance of improved rice varieties (ITA 118 and ITA 122), intercropped with various densities of bean, was measured against that of local varieties selected from on-farm variety trials. During the first season the two improved rice varieties greatly out-yielded a local variety which was severely affected by rice blast (Pyricularia oryzae Cavara). Neither rice yield nor bean yield was affected by bean density, but bean yield was significantly greater when intercropped with ITA 118 than with ITA 122, or a farmer's variety. Farmers' varieties under their own management were generally more productive than the improved varieties. In on-station trials during the second season, three farmers' varieties were compared with the two improved varieties intercropped at two densities of bean. Farmers' varieties out-yielded the improved ones at both bean densities. Bean yields were greater when grown with the improved rice varieties, apprently due to the shorter stature of the latter, and greater at the higher density. Maize-bean intercropping was studied simultaneously. Line-sown maize, intercropped with bean, yielded better than when sown in hills at the same density, but was more susceptible to lodging. Bean yields were unaffected by sowing arrangement, but yielded more when sown at higher densities. Sowing maize at two densities did not affect yield of the bean intercrop, but the maize yielded more at the higher density. Bean generally grew and produced better when intercropped with rice than with maize.

Yield advantages were noticed between 22-44% over sole maize cropping. Different production indices largely indicated the same pattern in ranking intercropping treatments. Of the other legumes used, mung also showed potential whereas cowpea and soyabean did not. Increasing cropping intensities through use of interspace by legume did not significantly reduce maize yield, particularly in combination with groundnut and mung. Soil nitrogen enrichment through legume cultivation could be noted through examination of soil test values and yield of succeeding wheat crop.

In this experiment, 25 populations of bush bean were evaluated for nutritional and culinary traits of dry seed and immature pod in sole crop and in intercrop in two years and in two locations, in order to determine whether selection of bush bean in sole crop can result in genetic progress for intercrop. There were no differences in the population means between cropping systems. Significant differences were detected among populations for all traits studied except starch content, crude ash, water absorption and coat proportion. Population x environment interaction was significant for pod thickness. Bean populations did not interact with cropping systems for any trait, although there were differences between cropping systems for crude protein. These results suggest that a sole crop system provides sufficient information to select bean populations efficiently for the bush bean-maize intercropping system, although the advanced generations of the breeding program should be tested for quantitative traits such as protein content in the appropriate cropping system (intercropping) to know the competitive ability with the associated species.

Leaf area index and dry-matter production of all the crops were maximum under irrigation and proper drainage system. Maize-equivalent yield was significantly highest (8.2 tonnes/ha) in case of maize + turmeric as compared to sole crops as well as maize + groundnut intercropping system during first year. However, during second year, difference between maize + turmeric and maize + groundnut system was not pronounced. Net return during first year did not differ between maize + groundnut and maize + turmeric but during second year maize + groundnut excelled in net return as compared to maize + turmeric. Irrigation with drainage provision resulted in maximum yield equivalence (7.5 tonnes/ha) and net return (Rs 11 752) as compared to other treatments. The water-use efficiency was maximum in case of pure crop of turmeric (0.499 tonne/ ha/cm) while in second year it was maximum (0.583 tonne/ha/cm) under sole crop of groundnut.

Values of land equivalent ratio (LER) and area-time equivalent ratio (ATER) with all the intercropping systems were greater indicating advantage in yield, land-use efficiency and monetary return/unit time and space over the respective monocultures. All the intercrops with maize recorded significantly higher maize-equivalent yield than the sole crop. Intercropping of maize with potato was more advantageous than the other intercrops.

Cowpea fixed around 60% of its N from the atmosphere amounting to 70 kg N ha(-1) under sole and 36 kg N ha(-1) under intercropping as estimated by the N-15 isotope dilution method around peak biomass production. The amount of N-2-fixed was 30-40% higher when P was applied as either TSP or MRP whereas cowpea yield were unaffected. Intercropped maize with 19,000 plant ha(-1) accumulated the same amount of N as 38,000 sole cropped maize plants although intercropping reduced the dry matter accumulation by 25%. The N uptake efficiency of the applied N-15 labelled fertiliser was 26%, which equal a total pool of early available plant N of 158 kg N ha(-1). Under the N deficient conditions, P application did not increase the grain yield of maize. The LER indicate that sole cropping required 18% more area than intercropping in order to produce the same grain yield, and 35% more land when LER was based on N uptakes. Introduction of break crops in the maize systems, more than doubled accumulation of dry matter and N in the grain compared to continuous maize cropping. During maturation sole crop cowpea shedded leaves containing 41 kg N ha(-1). The current findings underline the importance of crop diversity in Sub Saharan Africa agriculture and emphasise the need for including all residues, including shedded leaves, in nutrient balance studies.

Influence of cereal-legume rotation on Striga control and maize grain yield in farmers' fields in the northern Guinea savanna of Nigeria	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE TROPICS AND SUBTROPICS			English	Article						"maize; soybean; cowpea; cereal-legume rotation; intercropping; Striga"	"HERMONTHICA CONTROL; PARASITISM; MANAGEMENT; NITROGEN; SORGHUM"	On-farm trials were conducted in 2001, 2002, and 2003 in the northern Guinea savanna of Nigeria to evaluate integrated Striga hermonthica control measures under farmer-managed conditions. These included intercropping a Striga-resistant maize variety with cowpea for 3 years and also cropping this maize in rotation with legume trap crops -soybean and cowpea for 1-2 two years. Intercropping Striga-tolerant maize variety, Acr. 97TZL Comp. 1-W, with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) consistently reduced Striga infestation in maize relative to continuously cropped sole maize over the three-year period. Maize grain yield was lower in the intercrop than in the sole maize plot probably due to competition from cowpea. However, because of the high value of cowpea in the intercrop, crop value for this system was higher than sole cropped maize. Legume-maize rotation reduced Striga infestation by 35% after one year of legumes in the rotation and by 76% after two years of legumes in the rotation. Soybean was more effective in reducing Striga infestation and also gave higher maize grain yield than cowpea. The rotation of these two legumes with maize had clear advantage over continuously cropped maize. Farmers should therefore be encouraged to adopt the introduction of grain legumes into the cereal cropping systems of the Nigerian savanna.

Exploring farmer perceptions of agricultural innovations for maize-legume intensification in the mid-hills region of Nepal	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						"Agricultural innovations; participatory approaches; farmer perception; sustainable intensification; intercropping; adoption"	"CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; SUSTAINABLE INTENSIFICATION; PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH; SMALLHOLDER FARMERS; CROP IMPROVEMENT; ADOPTION; TECHNOLOGY; EXPERIMENTATION; RESEARCHERS; STRATEGIES"	Maize-legume intercropping is a fundamental component of mixed farming systems in the mid-hills of Nepal. However, its productivity is constrained by several biophysical and social factors, and limited adoption of proven agricultural innovations. In this study, we assessed the productivity impact of a selection of relevant agricultural innovations and changes in the associated perceptions of farmers through a series of two-year participatory on-farm trials. The evaluated innovations resulted in higher yields as compared to farmers' current practices. The active involvement of farmers enlarged our understanding of underlying decision-making factors to adopt or non-adopt agricultural innovations. Additionally, the in-depth farmer engagement in our onfarm trials positively influenced farmer perceptions of the innovations and their interest to adopt the agricultural innovations. Yet, farmers final decisions to adopt some of the evaluated innovations were limited by a host of factors including labour scarcity, the availability of inputs, and by cultural preferences despite the increased yields. This was particularly true for low and medium resource-endowed farmers. This study shows the importance of active farmer participation and context-specific design of research and development projects aiming for local impact.

However, how belowground interactions mediate root growth, N fixation, and nodulation of different legumes to affect N uptake is still unclear. Hence, a two-year experiment was conducted with five planting patterns, i.e., maize-soybean strip intercropping (IMS), maize-peanut strip intercropping (IMP), and corresponding monocultures (monoculture maize (MM), monoculture soybean (MS), and monoculture peanut (MP)), and two N application rates, i.e., no N fertilizer (N-) and conventional N fertilizer (N+), to examine relationships between N uptake and root distribution of crops, legume nodulation and soil N availability. Results showed that the averaged N uptake per unit area of intercrops was significantly lower than the corresponding monocultures. Compared with the monoculture system, the N uptake of the intercropping systems increased by 31.7-45.4% in IMS and by 7.4-12.2% in IMP, respectively. The N uptake per plant of intercropped maize and soybean significantly increased by 61.6 and 31.8%, and that of intercropped peanuts significantly decreased by 46.6% compared with the corresponding monocultures. Maize and soybean showed asymmetrical distribution of roots in strip intercropping systems. The root length density (RLD) and root surface area density (RSAD) of intercropped maize and soybean were significantly greater than that of the corresponding monocultures. The roots of intercropped peanuts were confined, which resulted in decreased RLD and RSAD compared with the monoculture. The nodule number and nodule fresh weight of soybean were significantly greater in IMS than in MS, and those of peanut were significantly lower in IMP than in MP. The soil protease, urease, and nitrate reductase activities of maize and soybean were significantly greater in IMS and IMP than in the corresponding monoculture, while the enzyme activities of peanut were significantly lower in IMP than in MP. The soil available N of maize and soybean was significantly greater increased in IMS and IMP than in the corresponding monocultures, while that of IMP was significantly lower than in MP. In summary, the IMS system was more beneficial to N uptake than the IMP system. The intercropping of maize and legumes can promote the N uptake of maize, thus reducing the need for N application and improving agricultural sustainability.

In southwest China, maize/soybean strip intercropping has commonly been practised under local limited agricultural land resources. However, heavy rainfall in combination with high humidity and low temperatures cause severe pod and seed deterioration in the maturity and pre-harvesting stages of intercropped soybean. Numerous Fusarium species have been reported as the dominant pathogens of soybean root rot, seedling blight, as well as pod field mold in this area. However, the diversity and pathogenicity of Fusarium species on soybean pods remain unclear. In the current study, diseased soybean pods were collected during the cropping season of 2018 from five different intercropped soybean producing areas. A total of 83 Fusarium isolates were isolated and identified as F. fujikuroi, F. graminearum, F. proliferatum, and F. incarnatum-equiseti species complex based on morphological characteristics and phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence of EF1-alpha and RPB2 genes. Pathogenicity tests demonstrated that all Fusarium species were pathogenic to seeds of the intercropped soybean cultivar Nandou12. Fusarium fujikuroi had the maximum disease severity, with a significant reduction of seed germination rate, root length, and seed weight, followed by F. equiseti, F. graminearum, F. proliferatum, and F. incarnatum. Additionally, the diversity of Fusarium species on soybean pods was also considerably distinct according to the geographical origin and soybean varieties. Thus, the findings of the current study will be helpful for the management and resistance breeding of soybean pod decay in the maize/soybean intercropping system.

This experiment was carried during over two years (2007 and 2008) on Research Center, University of Zabol, Iran. Results indicated that optimum forage quality from milky stage was obtained. Maize and cowpea intercrops were higher in total forage dry matter digestibility (DMD) than maize or cowpea grown as sole crops. Cowpea intercropped with maize led to increased forage quality (CP and DMD concentration) compared with sole-maize, and higher WSC concentrations compared with sole cowpea. The highest crude protein content was obtained by harvest time in milky stage (15.2%). It is suggested that maize-cowpea intercrops may have considerable potential as a high quality.

The role of intercropping maize (Zea mays L.) and Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) on yield and soil chemical properties	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						"Intercropping system; maize - cowpea; soil fertility; land equivalent ratio"	"ACID-PHOSPHATASE; NITROGEN; RHIZOSPHERE; SECRETION; PHYTASE; ROOTS"	Farmers in Sistan region experience low crop yields of crops due to low soil fertility. Sole crops and intercrops of maize (Zea mays L.) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) were studied at eight planting ratios of maize: cowpea (100:100, 50:100, 100:50, 25:75, 75:25, 50:50, 0:100 and 100:0) and two harvest times (milky stage and doughy stage). This experiment was carried during two years (2007 and 2008) on Research Center, University of Zabol, Iran, to investigate the influence of cowpea on the soil fertility and sole maize (SM) as control. Measurements of nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium soil and crop yield were carried out to study the effects of intercropping on crop yield in a cowpea-maize intercropping system in Sistan at southeast of Iran. We found that intercropping increased the amount nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) contents compared to sole crop of maize. The highest amount of N, P, and K in soil was obtained at sole cowpea and 100% cowpea + 100% maize with no significant difference to 100% cowpea + 50% maize. The lowest amount of N, P, and K was obtained at sole maize and 75% maize + 25% cowpea. Intercropping system had significant effects on soil fertility and crop yield. LER (land equivalent ratio) values were greater in all intercropping systems with different planting ratios which indicated yield advantage of intercropping over sole cropping of maize. Results indicate that intercropping can increase nutrient elements of soil compared to sole maize and improve conservation of soil fertility. Based on high grain and improve soil fertility intercrop productivity compared to sole crop could be selected for improving the productivity of maize/cowpea mixture in the Southeast of Iran.

Access to credit and maize productivity in Mali	AGRICULTURAL FINANCE REVIEW			English	Article						"Agricultural productivity; Endogenous switching regression; Credit; Maize; Gender; Production shocks; Sensitivity analysis; Mali"	"MATERIAL DETERMINANTS; AGRICULTURAL CREDIT; WATER CONSERVATION; FOOD SECURITY; IMPACT; CONSTRAINTS; ADOPTION; MARKETS; EFFICIENCY; TECHNOLOGIES"	Purpose The aim of this paper is to analyze the effects of access to credit on maize productivity in Mali, by identifying the determinants of credit market participation and maize yield, and then estimating the impact of credit on maize yield. Design/methodology/approach This study analyzes the impact of credit on maize productivity using data from the World Bank 2014 Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) on Mali, and the endogenous switching regression (ESR) model. Findings The results suggest a positive effect of credit on maize yield in Mali. Farm size, production shocks and the female gender exert negative effects on credit market participation, unlike education, intercropping with cotton, male family labor and fertilizer use which show positive effects. Farm size has a negative effect on maize yield, but both male family labor, and fertilizer use exert positive effects. Although the use of credit improves agricultural yields, the results show a greater potential effect for rationed producers, than credit users. Research limitations/implications These results suggest that implementing a credit strategy that allows those currently excluded from the credit market, to participate, could substantially increase productivity and maize production output in furtherance of the country's food security strategy. Gender-based targeting is needed to bridge the gender gap in access to credit. Originality/value As far as the authors are aware, this study is the first to explore the credit-farm productivity links in Mali, while addressing selection bias.

In a regional survey of aflatoxin conducted in 2009 across three agroecological zones within three administrative regions, milled maize samples were collected from 985 patrons of 26 hammer mills. Aflatoxin contamination was detected in 49% of samples and was above the regulatory (10 ppb) in 15% of the samples overall; 65% of samples from a drought-prone area were over the limit. In a detailed survey in Bungoma County, we investigated aflatoxin and fumonisin contamination in four popular maize varieties at harvest and after 2 and 4 months of storage. We collected whole-grain samples from farmers' storage sheds and milled samples from patrons of local mills. Mean aflatoxin contamination was identical for storage sheds and mills at 2.3 ppb. In all, 41% of the samples from mills had detectable aflatoxin, with 4% over the regulatory limit, whereas 87% had detectable fumonisin, with 50% over the regulatory limit (1 ppm). Mean contamination levels did not change during storage. Maize varieties differed in fumonisin contamination, with the most popular varieties vulnerable to both mycotoxins and weevils, which are potential factors in exacerbating mycotoxin contamination. Mycotoxin surveillance is important not just in areas known previously for aflatoxin contamination and acute poisoning but also is needed in all maize-producing regions."	"[Mutiga, S.

Recycling of legume residues for nitrogen economy and higher productivity in maize (Zea mays)-wheat (Triticum aestivum) cropping system	NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						"Economics; Grain yield; Intercropping; Legumes; Maize-equivalent; N balance; N fertilizer; Residue incorporation"	"RICE ORYZA-SATIVA; ZEA-MAYS; ELEUSINE-CORACANA; SUMMER LEGUMES; YIELD; SOIL; COMPETITION; MANAGEMENT; RATIO"	"Contribution of legumes towards N economy in cereal-based cropping systems is well-known but there has been a gradual decline in the cultivation of grain legumes, threatening sustainability of maize (Zea mays)-wheat (Triticum aestivum) cropping system in north-western India. A study was made to evaluate and quantify the effect of different grain legumes on productivity, profitability, N economy and soil fertility in maize-wheat cropping system at New Delhi during 2002-2004. Five legumes, viz. blackgram (Vigna mungo), greengram (Vigna radiata), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) and soybean (Glycine max) were either intercropped with maize or grown in sole cropping, and their residues were incorporated before the following crop of wheat, which was grown with varying rates of N, viz. 0, 40, 80 and 120 kg N ha(-1). Maize-equivalent productivity was significantly more with intercropped greengram (16.1-29.9%), cowpea (24.8%) and groundnut (11.1-16.6%) than in sole maize. Land equivalent ratio and other competitive functions were favourably influenced with intercropped maize + greengram and maize + cowpea. Addition of N through legume residues varied from 11.5-38.5 kg ha(-1) in intercropped system and 17.5-83.5 kg ha(-1) in sole cropping, which improved productivity of following wheat to a variable extent. Nitrogen economy in wheat was 21 kg ha(-1) due to residue incorporation of intercropped greengram, cowpea and groundnut; and 49-56 kg N ha(-1) of sole cropped greengram and groundnut. Residual soil fertility in terms of organic C and KMnO4-N showed an improvement under maize-based intercropping systems followed by wheat, and the beneficial effect was more pronounced with sole cropping of legumes due to greater addition of residues. Apparent N balance as well as actual change in KMnO4-N at the end of study was positive in most intercropped legumes as well as sole cropping systems, with greater improvement noticed under groundnut, soybean and greengram. Net returns were marginal with maize-based intercropping or sole cropping of legumes, but improved considerably with wheat, particularly when greengram, cowpea and groundnut were grown in the previous season. The studies suggested that inclusion of grain legumes, particularly greengram, cowpea and groundnut was beneficial for improving productivity, profitability, N economy and soil fertility in maize-wheat cropping system."

Green Manure and Overlapped Rhizosphere Effects on Pb Chemical Forms in Soil and Plant Uptake in Maize/Canola Intercrop Systems: A Rhizobox Study	SOIL & SEDIMENT CONTAMINATION			English	Article						"Rhizosphere effect; mixed-culture; overlapped rhizospheres; heavy metals; sequential extraction"	"BACTERIALLY INDUCED MINERALIZATION; PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS; CALCIUM-CARBONATE; TRACE-ELEMENTS; EXTRACTION; CADMIUM; METALS; ZINC; L.; EXOPOLYSACCHARIDES"	To investigate the effects of single and mixed cultures of maize and canola, green manure addition, and distance from the rhizosphere on chemical forms of soil lead (Pb) and its uptake by plants, a greenhouse experiment was conducted using rhizobox systems. After plant harvest, the soils from different parts of the rhizoboxes were sampled and analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and pH values. A sequential extraction procedure was also carried out to differentiate the chemical forms of Pb in the soil samples. Results showed that root activity significantly affected soil DOC concentration, pH and Pb chemical forms, while the effects generally ceased from the rhizosphere through the bulk soil. The pH value increased and DOC concentration decreased with distance from the roots. Green manure addition enhanced DOC concentration and exchangeable, carbonate-associated, and organic matter-bound Pb fractions. Green manure addition reduced the Pb concentration and uptake of maize but increased those of canola. The concentration of Pb in the roots of maize and canola was increased in intercropping compared with monocropping systems. The conclusion is that chemistry and bioavailability of soil Pb are interactively influenced by overlapped rhizospheres as compared to individual rhizospheres, use of green manure, and distance from the root surfaces.

Smith), an economically crucial polyphagous insect pest native to tropical and subtropical regions of America has reached Asia and noticed first time in maize fields South Karnataka in the Indian subcontinent during May 2018, causing substantial damage to the crop. The pest has invaded most of the maize growing area in India within a short period of two months posing a severe threat to maize growers, challenges to the scientific community and administrators. In the context of its economic importance and destructive nature, the identification, biology and life cycle, nature of damage and extent of yield loss, and management of fall armyworm through cultural practices, mechanical and local controls, biological and synthetic pesticides have been reviewed in detail in the present manuscript. Early planting and intercropping with non-host crops are essential cultural practices to reduce pest incidence. The crop which was monitored during the early vegetative stage showed a good response for synthetic pesticides, while crop damage was largest in late vegetative and pre-flowering stages. The pathways of the introduction of fall armyworm into Indian sub-continent are subject to speculations, however considering the lack of diapause mechanisms, its high spreading ability, and wide host plant range it is likely that the pest will soon be able to colonize most of tropical Asia. Hence, there is an urgent need for developing ecologically sustainable, economically profitable, and socially acceptable integrated pest management strategies to mitigate the impact of the fall armyworm in India and Asia.

However, knowledge on specific interactions in field conditions, especially below-ground interactions, is deficient. To evaluate the nature and strength of interspecific interactions between maize and potatoes, field and pot experiments were conducted using the 'target' technique, with three interaction models: no interaction (NI), below-ground interaction (BI) and full (both above and below-ground) interaction (FI). Plants were sampled at flowering and harvest periods to measure biomass and calculate the log response ratio (lnRR), root:shoot ratio and land equivalent ratio (LER). In the field experiment, the lnRR value of both BI and FI treatments for potatoes was >0, whereas for maize it was <0. This result accorded with differences in biomass, yield, Harvest Index and root:shoot ratio between the two treatments for both crops. Results showed that maize was subjected to competition (negative interaction), while potatoes obtained facilitation (positive interaction) when they were intercropped. In addition, after flowering there were no significant differences between BI and FI treatments in terms of biomass, lnRR, yield and LER for the two crops. Thus, compared with above-ground interaction, below-ground interaction (i.e. root competition for maize and root facilitation for potatoes) plays a more important role for crop growth and intercropping advantages. In the pot experiment, however, the lnRR values of both BI and FI treatments were <0 for both crops, so potatoes did not obtain a net profit from maize. However, the competitive capability of potatoes were significantly greater than maize when they were intercropped, which is consistent with results from the field experiment. Similarly, there were no significant differences between BI and FI treatments in terms of biomass, lnRR, root:shoot ratio and LER for the two crops. In summary, our study suggests that the root facilitation produced by maize for potatoes is a mechanism for overyielding in the maize-potato intercropping system. The potential of this system merits further research. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Treatments were laid out in a split-plot design with three replications. Three levels of nitrogen (0, 60 and 120 kg/ha) were assigned to the main plot, and ten periods of weed interference to the sub-plots. In both seasons, N-application resulted in significant increases in grain yields of maize and rice in the plots that were kept weed-free for 6 weeks and more. Uncontrolled weed growth resulted in 83.03% and 93.85% reductions in average grain yield of maize and rice respectively. Weed control for 9 weeks after sowing at 120 kgN/ha gave the best crop yields. However, it is recommended that for resource-poor farmers, rather than keeping plots weed-free for long periods, n-application of 60 kg/ha in combination with a weed-free regime of 6 weeks after sowing will be adequate to provide a good crop yield for the intercrop.

Mucuna was intercropped into maize at 6 and 9 weeks after planting (WAP) and plots without Mucuna were included as control. Intercropping of Mucuna had a positive impact on the chemical properties of soil especially when it was introduced 6 WAP of maize. In 2005-2006, clay, organic matter, total N, available P and CEC were improved by 14-8, 27-25, 50-43, 70-83 and 24-26%, respectively as compared with control, whereas sand and pH (H2O) declined by 4-17 and 6-3%, respectively during these years. Intercropping of Mucuna did not significantly affect the yield and yield components of maize. Mucuna reduced weed density by 52% and 16% when introduced at 6 and 9 WAP, respectively. The study showed that degraded soil infested by weeds could be reclaimed by intercropping maize with Mucuna. The legume could be introduced six weeks after planting maize.

J	Breland, TA				Breland, TA			Green manuring with clover and ryegrass catch crops undersown in small grains: Crop development and yields	ACTA AGRICULTURAE SCANDINAVICA SECTION B-SOIL AND PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						"cover crop; fertilizer replacement value; mixed cropping; residual effect; species interaction; undersowing; weeds"	"ITALIAN RYEGRASS; WINTER-WHEAT; NITROGEN; SOIL; GROWTH; BARLEY; FATE"	In three field trials in southern Norway, spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) or barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) monoculture was compared with crops undersown with Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.), white clover (Trifolium repens L.) and subterranean clover (T. subterraneum L.) at three levels of N fertilizer. The catch crops were ploughed in in late October, and the after-effect on succeeding spring wheat or barley crops was determined. The catch crops were more competitive in 1986, when rainfall in spring was abundant, than in 1985, when it was low. Ryegrass was stimulated by N fertilizer, whereas the clovers were repressed owing to increased shading. At ploughing, catch-crop biomass N ranged from 17 to 94, 37 to 155 and 41 to 243 kg N ha(-1) for ryegrass, white clover and subterranean clover, respectively. Grain yields (mean of N-fertilized plots), respectively, ranged from 83 to 94, 84 to 110 and 84 to 100% of yields in monoculture. The catch crops reduced weeds. The fertilizer replacement value of ploughed-in white clover was 50-60 kg N ha(-1) on loam soil without N fertilizer. Fertilizer N given either of the years decreased the grain yield response to white clover. Yet, the grain yield with white clover plus 60 kg N ha(-1) exceeded that on plots receiving 120 kg N ha(-1) as mineral fertilizer only. On sandy loam, the aftereffect was much smaller, most likely owing to N loss during wet conditions in the spring. The effect of ryegrass was neutral and that of subterranean clover intermediate.

Nitrate Leaching in Maize (Zea mays L.) and Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Irrigated Cropping Systems under Nitrification Inhibitor and/or Intercropping Effects	AGRICULTURE-BASEL			English	Article						"sustainable cropping systems; nitrogen use efficiency; fertilizer management; vetch; maize; wheat"	"FERTILIZER NITROGEN; N2O EMISSIONS; COVER CROPS; DURUM-WHEAT; SOIL; ROTATION; YIELD; RATES; EFFICIENCY; RECOVERY"	The use of nitrogen fertilizers in agriculture is currently under high pressure to reduce its environmental impact and improve its currently low efficiency. Nitrification inhibitors and/or intercrops emerged in recent decades as useful tools to combat these problems. The objective of the experiment is to study the effect of these techniques on the yield, the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and N leaching in a maize-wheat rotation. Six treatments were studied, combining the use of ammonium nitrate sulfate (ASN) alone or with a nitrification inhibitor (DMPSA or 3,4-dimethylpyrazole succinic acid) and the use or absence of vetch (Vicia sativa L.) as an intercrop. The results showed that fertilized treatments did not show significant differences in crop development, but the use of DMPSA delayed the nitrate (NO3-) availability and reduced N leaching losses (average N leaching reductions around 25% after maize harvest). On the other hand, the use of vetch as an intercrop helped to reduce the negative effects of N deficiency and, at the same time, increased the concentration of N in the soil during the following crop harvest (4.5 kg N ha(-1) on average after wheat harvest) and reduced losses due to leaching (average N leaching reductions around 14% after the maize-wheat season). The combination of both techniques (DMPSA and vetch intercrop) at the same time presented a synergic effect and greatly improved the environmental impact of the irrigated maize-wheat system.

However, the extent to which root morphology contributes to N fixation and transfer is unclear. A two-factorial greenhouse experiment was conducted to quantify the N fixation, transfer and root morphology characteristics of the maize/alfalfa intercropping system in two consecutive years using the 15N-urea leaf labeling method, and combining two N levels with three root separation techniques. N application could inhibit N fixation and transfer in a maize/alfalfa intercropping system. Irrespective of the N application level, compared with plastic sheet separation (PSS), no separation (NS) and nylon mesh separation (NNS) significantly increased the total biomass (36%) and total N content (28%), while the N fixation rate also sharply increased by 75 to 134%, and the amount of N transferred with no root barrier was 1.24-1.42 times greater than that with a mesh barrier. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the crown root dry weight (CRDW) of maize and lateral root number (LRN) of alfalfa showed the strongest associations with N fixation and transfer. Our results highlight the importance of root contact for the enhancement of N fixation and transfer via changes in root morphology in maize/alfalfa intercropping systems, and the overyielding system was achieved via increases in maize growth, at the cost of smaller decreases in alfalfa biomass production.

Intensive applications of chemical fertilizers bring about pollutions to the environment; therefore, the use of biofertilizers as an alternative fertilizer or as a supplement for the chemical fertilizers is essential to be studied in the field trials. This study was to search for the formulation of Azotobacter sp. isolate effective to promote growth and yield of local maize and sorghum grown in a multiple cropping system. It was done in based on the Randomized Block Design in a two-factor factorial design. The first factor was planting system and the second one was the formulation of Azotobacter sp., a mixture of LP7a+KU6e and LT2d1+KU6e isolate. The results showed an interaction effect between the two factors tested on growth and yield of local maize and sorghum, LER partial of maize crop and total LER of the maize sorghum multiple-cropping system. Therefore, it can be concluded that the formulation of Azotobacter sp., a mixture of LP7a+KU6e and LT2d1+KU6e isolate, was effective in increasing the plant N and P availability and in reducing the use of N and P chemical fertilizers on local maize and sorghum grown in an intercropping system in an Ultisol."

In groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.), dry-matter accumulation was substantially greater in sole cropping, compared with intercropping. Final pod yield was 34-57% as high as sole cropping, this being achieved by increase in pads/plant, pod weight/plant and 100-kernel weight. In maize (Zea mays L.), yield and yield attributes of intercrop maize did not differ from sole maize, but intercrop maize gave 16.2 and 13.8 q/ha extra pod yield of intercrop groundnut at 1 : 2 and 2 : 3 row ratio respectively. Calculated on the basis of land-equivalent ratio, an intercropping gave 82 and 70% more productive yield than growing the 2:crops separately. Row ratio 1 : 2 showed the maximum monetary return and was about 6 times more than sole maize. Irrigation increased cobs/plant of maize and pods/plant, pod weight/plant and kernels/pod in groundnut, Three irrigations improved maize yield by 32% and groundnut pod yield by 51%, giving the highest monetary return, 1.5 times of rainfed treatment. Oil content in groundnut remained unaffected due to intercropping systems, but increased with irrigation. Intercropping decreased oil yield, while irrigation augmented it.

J	Koca, YO				Koca, Yakup Onur			DETERMINATION OF THE FORAGE YIELD AND GROWTH PARAMETERS OF MAIZE (Zea mays L.) WITH QUINOA (Chenopodium quinoa) INTERCROPPING AT DIFFERENT PLANT MIXTURES	TURKISH JOURNAL OF FIELD CROPS			English	Article						"Maize; quinoa; intercropping; protein yield; RGR; CGR; GDD"	"DRY-MATTER ACCUMULATION; BRACHIARIA-BRIZANTHA; GRAIN-YIELD; CORN-SILAGE; TEMPERATURE; DIGESTIBILITY; ADAPTATION; QUALITY; WILLD."	The aim of this study was to grow maize with quinoa plants as an alternative in an intercropping system and to determine the effects of different plant mixtures on production. For this purpose, a trial was carried out in the coastal Aegean region (Aydin Province) of Turkey under Mediterranean climate conditions. In addition to 100% maize and 100% quinoa (monocultures), 3 different mixtures (75% maize-25% quinoa, 50% maize-50% quinoa and 25% maize-75% quinoa) were also created with the help of the row numbers in plots. To determine the effects of the different plant mixtures, the ash rate, forage yield and protein yield were measured in the mid-dough stage of maize. Moreover, the dry weights of the plants and plant parts (leaf, stalk and ear) were measured on 9 different sampling dates throughout the generative period, and the relative growth rate (RGR) and crop growth rate (CGR) were calculated. As a result, some climatic factors (extreme temperatures in 2020 and extreme rainfall in June 2019) had major impacts on the RGR and CGR values. Although the amount of maize dry matter increased in almost all mixtures, quinoa performed well only in the 50% quinoa-50% maize practice. In terms of forage yield and quality, quinoa can serve as a good alternative plant in intercropping systems with maize to improve the forage quality (with higher protein yields and ash rates) without reducing the forage yield excessively.

The yield and quality of fresh and ensiled plant material from intercropped maize (Zea mays) and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris)	JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE			English	Article						"maize; Zea mays; bean; Phaseolus vulgaris; intercropping; silage yield; crude protein"	"NITROGEN; FIELD; PRODUCTIVITY; DENSITY"	An investigation was carried out in the UK to determine whether intercropping with Phaseolus vulgaris beans increases the yield and nutritional quality of maize forage. Fresh and dry yields arising from different sowing dates and different densities of the two species were evaluated, with total nitrogen concentration (TNC) of the plants, and crude protein concentration (CPC), dry matter, metabolizable energy (ME), pH and starch, lactic acid and ash contents of ensiled material. Highest biomass yields of intercrops were obtained when the two species were planted simultaneously. There was a higher TNC in intercropped maize plants than in maize plants grown without beans (P < 0.05). Biomass yields were not significantly higher with a higher density of maize in the intercrop than with a lower density, nor were they higher with monocrop maize than with intercropping. However, the biomass had higher CPC at 75 000 maize plus 50 000 beans ha(-1) and 50 000 maize plus 50 000 beans ha(-1) than monocrop, maize. Other nutritional characteristics of the silage made from the intercrop, treatments were not significantly different from those of the silage made from monocrop, maize. As the silage from intercrops of 75 000 maize plus 50 000 beans ha-1 and 50 000 maize plus 50 000 beans hat gave more CP per land area than monocrop silage, and gave biomass yields that were not significantly different from monocrop maize, it was concluded that such intercropping is suitable for producing high-quality silage under similar agro-climatic conditions.

The effect of maize (Zea mays L.) plant density on N utilization and N fertilizer supply in maize/pea (Pisum sativum L.) strip intercropping was evaluated in a field study with sole maize, sole pea, and intercropped maize/pea with three maize densities (D1, 45,000 plants ha(-1); D2, 52,500 plants ha(-1); D3, 60,000 plants ha(-1)) and two N treatments (N0, 0 kg N ha(-1); N1, 450 kg N ha-1 for maize and 225 kg N ha(-1) for pea). Soil mineral N in intercropped strips decreased with increased maize density. Increased maize density decreased N accumulation for intercropped pea but increased it for maize and the sum of both intercrops. The land equivalent ratio for grain yield (LER grain) showed a 24-30% advantage for intercrops than corresponding sole crops, and was greater with D3 than D1 and D2. Maize/pea intercropping had 4-113% greater nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) than sole maize, which was enhanced with increased maize density.

The plant height and the leaf area index (LAI) increased as the planting density increased in sole or intercropped okra while the number of branches per plant decreased with increasing okra planting density. The height of maize plants also increased as okra planting density increased but the LAI decreased. Intercropping reduced the yield and yield components (number and weight of pods per plant) of okra and maize (number of cobs, cob length and 100-grain weight). Increasing okra planting density reduced the sole and the intercropped okra and also the maize intercrop yield by reducing the number of pods and grains as well as the pod and grain size, respectively. Assessment of the productivity of the mixtures showed that the highest yield advantage (35%) of growing okra and maize together was obtained at 28 000 okra plants ha(-1) while the highest monetary return was realized at the highest okra planting density of 111 000 plants ha(-1) intercropped between maize rows.

The wheat-maize-soybean relay intercropping system has been widely employed by famers in Southwestern China for years, but the detailed mechanisms through which the nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency reach the high level in this system remain unclear. In the present study, two separate pot experiments were performed by N-15 isotope dilution (ID) labeling and direct N-15 foliar feeding (Ft) assays, and a solid barrier was employed to prevent the roots intergrowth and N movement among crops in the first experiment, using no barrier as the control. The results showed that, under the no-barrier condition, the grain yields, N-15 uptake and N-15 recovery efficiency of wheat and maize were significantly increased, but those measures in soybean were decreased compared to the solid barrier condition. Furthermore, hi-directional N transfer was detected during the co-growing stage of crops, the amount (N-transfer) and percentage (%NT) of N-15 transferred varied significantly with the fertilizer-N rate, and the maximum reached at 150 - 300 kg N ha(-1) level. The N-transfer fer from maize to wheat was 16.1% - 163.0% higher than that from wheat to maize; the N-transfer from soybean to maize was 1.7 - 6.0 times higher than those from maize to soybean, while the %NT from soybean to maize were 6.7 - 22.2 times higher than those from maize to soybean. Conclusively, this study revealed that the interaction of the roots among crops significantly increased the uptake efficiency and recovery efficiency, and further, the positive N competition and hi-directional N transfer of each crops were the main contributors to improve the N use efficiency in the wheat-maize-soybean relay intercropping system."

In alkaline Mediterranean soils with P deficiency, it is assumed that legumes increase inorganic P availability. Methods A field experiment was conducted at the Staoueli experimental station, in Algiers province, Algeria, to compare the growth, grain yield, P availability, and P uptake by plants with sole-cropped cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. cv. Moh Ouali) and maize (Zea mays L. cv. ILT), intercropped cowpea-maize, and fallow. Results P availability in the rhizosphere was increased in both sole cropping and intercropping systems compared with fallow. It was highest in intercropping. The increase in P availability was associated with (i) significant pH changes of the rhizosphere of cowpea in sole cropping and intercropping systems, with the rhizosphere acidification significantly higher in intercropping (-0.73 units) than in sole cropping (-0.42 units); (ii) significant increase in the rhizosphere pH of intercropped maize (+0.49 units) compared to fallow; (iii) increased soil respiration (C-CO2 from microbial and root activity) in intercropping compared with sole cropping and fallow; and (iv) higher efficiency in utilization of the rhizobial symbiosis in intercropping than in sole-cropped cowpea. Conclusion With cowpea-maize intercropping, cowpea increased the P uptake, by increasing the P availability by rhizosphere pH changes in an alkaline soil. Overall, this study showed that intercropping cowpea improved the plant biomass and grain yield of maize in this soil."	"[Latati, M.; Ounane, S.

However, the physiological and anatomical mechanisms of grain yield increase at high plant densities in maize-based intercropping systems are not well understood. A two-year field experiment was conducted in 2018 and 2019 to investigate grain yield, photosynthetic characteristics, stomatal traits, and leaf anatomy of maize plants in an intercrop-ping system with high plant densities. Two cropping patterns (monocropping and intercropping) and three plant densities (D1, 78,000 plants ha(-1); D2, 103,500 plants ha -1; D3, 129,000 plants ha(-1)) were arranged in a randomized block design. Increasing maize plant density significantly increased maize yield, and intercropping gave a significant yield advantage over monocropping under the same plant den-sity. Intercropping combined with high plant density increased the leaf area and SPAD value of maize, increasing the photosynthesis rates after the harvest of pea. At the twelfth leaf stage, the stomatal density and stomatal area of intercrops combined with medium plant density increased by respectively 10.5% and 18.4% relative to their values for the corresponding density of monocrops. Although leaf thickness of maize was reduced by increasing plant density, the chloroplast number and grana lamella number were higher in intercropping than in monocropping under different plant densities.

The legumes, being a mixture of alfalfa, clover and hairy vetch, had a significant cumulative effect on some physical properties of both soil. The lowest stability and smallest mean weight diameter of soil aggregates were associated with monoculture maize plots. Aggregate size and stability were not affected by N fertilization at any of the rates of 0, 70, and 140 kg ha-1 in intercropped plots, except that aggregate stability was actually reduced by N fertilization in one soil, the Ste. Rosalie clay. In maize plots in both soils, stability and size of soil aggregates were significantly increased with increased added N. Intercropped legumes significantly decreased dry bulk density and soil penetration resistance. Added N had no measurable influence on these compaction factors. Soil water properties were not significantly affected by either intercropping or N fertilization. Positive effects noted on soil aggregation and other physical properties in intercropped plots are the result of enhanced root activity, or incorporation of legumes as green manure, or both. Improvement of soil structure in maize plots associated with increasing N application was the result of increased maize-root residues.

Tillage and mulching effects on performance of maize (Zea mays)-wheat (Triticum aestivum) cropping system under varying land slopes	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						"Land slopes; Live mulching; Maize; Minimum tillage; Moisture conservation"	INDIA	A field experiment was conducted at Selakui, Dehradun during 2001-04 to study the effect of tillage (conventional and minimum) and mulching practices (no mulching and live mulching) under artificially created varying land slopes (0.5, 2.5, 4.5 and 9.5%) on soil-moisture conservation, productivity and nutrient uptake in maize (Zea mays L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend Fiori & Paol.) cropping system. Sunnhemp (Crotalaria juncea L.) intercropped with maize gave 0.87-1.09 tonnes biomass (dry weight) and accumulated 24.8-31.4 kg N/ha at 30 days of growth when it was mulched. Biomass and N accumulation generally decreased with increasing land slope and under minimum tillage. Maize performed better on moderate slopes (2.5-4.5%) than on the relatively flat (0.5%) and highly sloping land (9.5%). However, the yield of wheat decreased linearly and significantly with increasing slope due to less conservation of soil moisture on sloping lands during the previous rainy season. Conventional tillage gave significantly higher productivity of both maize and wheat than the minimum tillage. Intercropping of maize with sunnhemp and spreading the cut biomass as mulch at 30 days (live mulching) improved soil moisture conservation at maize harvest (+1.63 to 1.94%), and yield of maize (12.0%) as well as of following wheat (13.8%) compared with the no mulching.

Results of this work revealed that the highest U.V. spectra measurements at bands 270 nm, were 2.5 for the oils of Crowmord soybean seed variety intensificated on Giza 15 sorghum variety intensity 2:4 (2 rows soybean: 4 rows sorghum) and Giza 2, Hz 215 and Hz 310 maize varieties, intensity 2:2, 2:4, 2:4 and 2:2 respectively in the regions of spectra differences. The intensification of Clark and Crowmord soybean varieties on sorghum and maize is effective as the physical properties of their oils improved by increasing the cromophor and carotenoids compound levels.

To optimize agronomic advantage of maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L.) intercropping system compared to monoculture of maize, two sequential experiments were conducted. Experiment 1 was to screening the optimal cropping system in summer that had the highest yields and economic benefits, and Experiment 2 was to identify the optimum row ratio of the intercrops selected from Experiment 1. Results of Experiment 1 showed that maize intercropping with soybean (maize parallel to soybean) was the optimal cropping system in summer. Compared to conventional monoculture of maize, maize parallel to soybean had significant advantage in yield, economy, land utilization ratio and reducing soil nitrate nitrogen (N) accumulation, as well as better residual effect on the subsequent wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop. Experiment 2 showed that intercropping systems reduced use of N fertilizer per unit land area and increased relative biomass of intercropped maize, due to promoted photosynthetic efficiency of border rows and N utilization during symbiotic period. Intercropping advantage began to emerge at tasseling stage after N topdressing for maize. Among all treatments with different row ratios, alternating four maize rows with six soybean rows (4M:6S) had the largest land equivalent ratio (1.30), total N accumulation in crops (258 kg ha(-1)), and economic benefit (3,408 USD ha(-1)). Compared to maize monoculture, 4M:6S had significantly lower nitrate-N accumulation in soil both after harvest of maize and after harvest of the subsequent wheat, but it did not decrease yield of wheat. The most important advantage of 4M:6S was to increase biomass of intercropped maize and soybean, which further led to the increase of total N accumulation by crops as well as economic benefit. In conclusion, alternating four maize rows with six soybean rows was the optimum row ratio in maize parallel to soybean system, though this needs to be further confirmed by pluri-annual trials.

The current study has been conducted to evaluate the effect of intercropping maize with legumes covers on Soil Moisture improvement at Misrak Azerinet Berbere woreda. Seven treatments evaluated were vetch with maize, lablab with maize, vetch only, lablab only, and maize only. The experimental design was in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications in a permanent plot. Disturbed soil samples were collected from the intra-row spacing from both intercropped and non-intercropped plots from the depth of 0-20 cm and composited for soil moisture analysis. The yield and biomass of maize and legume shrubs have been collected. The Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) was computed to evaluate the land productivity of intercropped combinations. The result reveals that in both years, yield, biomass, and soil moisture content were not significant (p > 0.05) at a statistically significant level. After crop harvest, maize with lablab has better soil moisture relative to other combinations (first year). In both years, the soil moisture content in the soil was reduced in the sole crop of maize compared with sole vetch. However, the soil moisture content in the soil was increased in maize intercropped with lablab in both development stage and after harvest compared with maize intercropped with vetch. Both legume shrubs under mono and intercropped conditions conserve soil moisture relative to maize under mono cropped conditions. This implies the benefit of legume shrubs on soil moisture conservation both planted under mono cropped conditions and intercropped conditions. It is concluded that the combination of intercropping maize with legume shrubs could substantially increase soil moisture conservation and improve the overall land productivity. Therefore, for maximum maize production, farmers in the area should plant maize with a combination of vetch and lablab. Additionally, farmers should practice double cropping with the residual soil moisture from legume and its combinations.

Due to the popularity of cassava-maize intercropping and the food security and economic importance of both crops in Nigeria, we investigated options to improve interception of photosynthetically active radiation (IPAR), radiation use efficiency (RUE), soil moisture retention, and yields of cassava and maize in cassava-maize intercropping systems in 8 on-farm researcher-managed multi-location trials between 2017 and 2019 in different agroecologies of southern Nigeria. Treatments were a combination of (1) maize planting density (low density at 20,000 maize plants ha(-1) versus high density at 40,000 maize plants ha(-1), intercropped with 12,500 cassava plants ha(-1)); (2) fertilizer application and management targeting either the maize crop (90 kg N, 20 kg P and 37 kg K ha(-1)) or the cassava crop (75 kg N, 20 kg P and 90 kg K ha(-1)), compared with control without fertilizer application. Cassava and maize development parameters were highest in the maize fertilizer regime, resulting in the highest IPAR at high maize density. The combined intercrop biomass yield was highest at high maize density in the maize fertilizer regime. Without fertilizer application, RUE was highest at low maize density. However, the application of the maize fertilizer regime at high maize density resulted in the highest RUE, soil moisture content, and maize grain yield. Cassava storage root yield was higher in the cassava fertilizer regime than in the maize fertilizer regime. We conclude that improved IPAR, RUE, soil moisture retention, and grain yield on nutrient-limited soils of southern Nigeria, or in similar environments, can be achieved by intercropping 40,000 maize plants ha(-1) with 12,500 cassava plants ha(-1) and managing the system with the maize fertilizer regime. However, for higher cassava storage root yield, the system should be managed with the cassava fertilizer regime."

Management of hot pepper anthracnose relies on costly fungicide sprays, which have severely limited the development of the hot pepper industry in China. As an alternative management strategy, we evaluated the performance of hot pepper (P) intercropped with maize (M) at different intercropping ratios on anthracnose disease and yield. Compared with monocropping, intercropping significantly reduced anthracnose incidence and delayed the onset of the disease. The mechanisms by which the intercropping system reduced anthracnose incidence included interfering with spore dispersal, decreasing the incidence of sunscald, and altering the microclimate. A significant difference in the percentage of marketable hot pepper fruit was observed between intercropping (P4|M1, P5|M1 and P6|M1) and monocropping systems. The hot pepper fruit yield in the P6|M1 system (19.5-32.7 t/ha) was equivalent to that in the monocrop system and had a land equivalent ratio > 1 (1.32, 1.36). Considering the reduction in anthracnose incidence and increased land utilization efficiency, the hot pepper-maize (P6|M1) intercropping system is a favorable measure for controlling hot pepper anthracnose. This work provides a foundation for the sustainable management of hot pepper anthracnose and increases the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the reduction of anthracnose in the hot pepper-maize intercropping system.

Influence of soybean-crop proportion on the conservation of maize-soybean bi-crop silage	ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						"Aerobic stability; Fermentation; Intercropping; Legume"	"CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; DETERGENT FIBER; WHOLE-PLANT; FERMENTATION; FORAGE; ACID; CORN"	Our objective was to determine the influence of soybean proportion on the conservation of maize-soybean bi-crop silages. We hypothesized that the aerobic stability of bi-crop silages would increase with the level of legume in the mixture, without affecting fermentative losses. Maize (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max) were cultivated in alternating rows within four 0.5-ha plots and manually harvested when the maize crop reached 330 g/kg of dry matter (DM). After cut, maize and soybean plants from each plot were chopped separately. Five proportions of whole-plant soybean were mixed with whole-plant maize, ensiled in laboratory silos (0, 125, 250, 375 and 500 g/kg of fresh matter) and stored for 90 d. As expected, crude protein increased linearly with the inclusion of soybean crop in the mixed silages (from 106 to 154 g/kg DM), mainly at the expense of soluble N. On the other hand, the addition of soybean increased DM loss during fermentation (from 59 to 109 g/kg) without altering yeast counts and aerobic stability of the silages. The increase in 2,3-butanediol, ethanol and acetic acid concentrations suggested that soybean addition favored the development of enterobacteria. In vitro DM and fiber digestibility linearly decreased with the inclusion of soybean, due to an increase in acid detergent fiber content. In conclusion, despite the expected increase in crude protein, mixing up to 500 g/kg of whole-plant soybean in whole-plant maize at ensiling did not improve aerobic stability, increased fermentative losses and reduced the in vitro digestibility of the silages compared with whole-plant maize silage.

We tested the hypothesis that desmodium (Desmodium intortum (Mill.)

We measured available N and P in 15 cm topsoil at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after planting (WAP), and corresponding maize shoot weight in three seasons: 2017 long rains (LR), 2017 short rains (SR), and 2018 LR at Thomas Odhiambo Campus of icipe at Mbita Point in western Kenya. Treatments were additive 1:1 maize-legume intercrops; maize-bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), maize-cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.), maize-crotalaria (Crotalaria ochroleuca G. Don), maize-desmodium, maize-green gram [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek] and maize-groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.), and maize monocrop as a control, replicated four times in a complete randomized design. This experiment was established in 2003 and treatments were repeated every season on the same plot (for 31 seasons up to 2018 LR). At the beginning (year 2003), experimental plots were infested with 100 g of striga seeds per 250 g soil. Across the three last seasons corresponding to this study, we observed an increase in available N in maize-desmodium plots compared to maize monocrop plots. Available P measured at 4, 8 and 12 WAP in 2017 SR and at 4 WAP in 2018 LR was higher in maize-desmodium than in maize monocrop at the same sampling times (P < 0.05). The shoot weight for maize grown with desmodium was consistently higher than that for maize grown in monocrop. Maize grain yield for maize-desmodium was 5.0, 3.1 and 4.3 Mg ha-1 in 2017 LR, 2017 SR and 2018 LR, respectively, compared to 0.5, 0.4 and 1.8 Mg ha-1 for maize monocrop in the three respective seasons. Other intercrops were comparable with maize monocrop. Historic maize yields were constantly higher in maize-desmodium than maize monocrop and other maize-legume intercrops. We show that desmodium improves N and P availability, growth and yield of maize. We recommend studies on biological N fixation and changes in rhizosphere to understand mechanisms behind observed improvement in N and P availability."

The content of this nutrient in plants is variable, and its uptake by plants is influenced by both abiotic and biotic factors. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of interactions between spring barley and Italian ryegrass in pure and mixed stands on the Mg content of the aerial biomass and uptake by both plant species under different soil moisture conditions. Three series of a pot experiment were conducted in greenhouse under controlled conditions. The following experimental factors were analyzed: (1) stand type (each plant species was sown in pure and mixed stands), (2) water supply (optimal and reduced by 50%). The Mg content of the aerial biomass of plants was determined in five growth stages (leaf development, tillering, stem elongation, heading, ripening) corresponding to the development of pure-sown barley under optimal water supply conditions. The Mg content was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry, and the Mg uptake was calculated based on the Mg content and dry matter accumulation in plants. Neither a stand type nor the water deficit had a significant effect on the Mg content in the aerial biomass of barley and Italian ryegrass during their growth and development. Both the stand type and water supply significantly affected the Mg uptake by the aerial parts of plants. From emergence to heading, the Mg uptake by spring barley was hindered by water deficit rather than by competition with Italian ryegrass. The responses of Italian ryegrass to water stress and competition with barley varied in the initial growth stages, whereas during later growth stages, the Mg uptake was limited by competition with barley rather than by water deficit.

Results revealed that although potato performed better in 2:2 intercropping system and maize in 1:1 intercropping system, maximum advantage in terms of yield and competition was obtained when both the crops were grown in intercropping with 75% of their sole crop population, irrespective of planting pattern. The relative crowding coefficient values indicated that at similar planting densities, maize was more competitive than potato in 1:1 planting pattern, whereas potato was more competitive than maize in 2:2 planting pattern. The competitive ratio also showed that performance of potato in terms of yield was better than maize when planted in 2:2 pattern. The land equivalent ratio and product of relative crowding coefficient indicated that potato + maize intercropping was advantageous when both the crops were planted with 75% density, either in 1:1 or 2:2 ratio.

Reduced nitrate leaching in a perennial grain crop compared to maize in the Upper Midwest, USA	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"Nitrate leaching; Perennial grains; Lysimeter; DNDC model; Intermediate wheatgrass; Switchgrass; Maize; Intercropping"	"PRAIRIE FILTER STRIPS; INTERMEDIATE WHEATGRASS; NITROGEN; BIOENERGY; GROUNDWATER; SYSTEMS; MODEL; WATER; EFFICIENCY; CONVERSION"	"Global expansion of high-input annual grain crops and associated nitrogen (N) fertilizer use can have negative consequences for the environment and human health. Nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) leaching from fertilized annual crops can contaminate groundwater and pollute natural aquatic ecosystems and rural drinking water sources. Intermediate wheatgrass (IWG; Thinopyrum intermedium) is a perennial grass being domesticated to serve as the world's first widely available perennial grain crop. Our objective was to measure water quality variables and crop yields in order to model NO3-N leaching beneath IWG, maize, and switchgrass under three N fertilizer treatments; low N (0 kg N ha(-1)), medium N (maize = 80, switchgrass and IWG = 40 kg N ha(-1)), and high N (maize = 160, switchgrass and IWG = 120 or 160 kg N ha(-1)). The switchgrass and IWG medium N treatments also included alfalfa as an intercrop. The NO3-N concentration in soil solution 50 cm below the surface was one and two orders of magnitude lower in high N fertilized IWG compared to switchgrass and maize, respectively. Soil solution NO3-N increased with N fertilizer in all crops. Soil water content was less at 50 and 100 cm depths in IWG compared to switchgrass and maize but was unaffected by N fertilizer treatment. Using the Denitrification and Decomposition (DNDC) model, average annual NO3-N leaching estimates in the high N treatments were 21.7 kg N ha(-1) for maize and 3.7 and 0.2 kg N ha(-1) for switchgrass and IWG, respectively. Despite consistent biomass yields through time, IWG grain yields decreased with stand age at all N fertilizer treatments. Alfalfa did not persist in the IWG and switchgrass medium N treatments, thus other legumes should be tested for intercropping with perennial grain crops. Intermediate wheatgrass has great potential to provide food-quality grain and biomass while preventing NO3-N leaching."

Samples were taken with an entomological net with 60 trappings/sample every two weeks. Contingency tables and proportion comparisons were used for analysing the data. The main insects affecting Leucaena were: Heteropsylla cubana (148-938) and Euxesta stigmatias (9-81) which had a lower incidence in maize and weeds. In maize,insect infestation was negligible and a high population of Dorn taeniatum, preying on larvae nymphs(Spodoptera frugiperda) was observed. However in weeds the highest incidence was of Draeculacephala cubana, Hortensia simiIis, Polymerus cuneatus and Diabrotica balteata. The presence of Mocis latipes was negigible. Regardless the number of insects collected, no important detrimental effect was found in crops. The results demonstrate that there was a greater incidence when plants were intercropped at 15 days and lower at 40 days. It is concluded that on intercropping at 15 days, the number of insects did not damage maize nor Leucaena during establishment and a land use is more efficient.

The impact of Desmodium spp. and cutting regimes on the agronomic and economic performance of Desmodium-maize intercropping system in western Kenya	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Desmodium intortum; Desmodium uncinatum; Maize; Striga"	"PUSH-PULL TECHNOLOGY; SOIL FERTILITY MANAGEMENT; MINJINGU PHOSPHATE ROCK; STRIGA-HERMONTHICA; INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT; CEREAL STEMBORERS; PHOSPHORUS; RESIDUES; LEGUMES; SORGHUM"	Low soil fertility, stemborers (particularly. Chiba partellus) and Striga weeds (Striga hermonthica and Striga asiatica) are major limitations to production of maize in western Kenya. The Push-Pull technology (PPT) has been described as an appropriate innovative technology capable of addressing these constraints. The technology involves intercropping maize with Desmodium and planting Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) around the intercrop, but in the current study a modified PPT was used and Napier grass was not included. Field trials were conducted in two locations in western Kenya during 4 subsequent seasons to test the hypothesis that maize yield, the degree of Striga suppression and economic benefits of intercropping maize with Desmodium are affected by: (i) the related biomass production by different Desmodium species and (ii) the cutting regime of the Desmodium. Maize was intercropped with Desmodium uncinatum (Jacq.) DC, cv Silverleaf or Desmodium intortum (Mill.) Urb. cv Greenleaf, and treatments with sole maize (with and without urea) were included for comparison. To eliminate phosphorus (P) deficiency, all treatments received basal P. The first two Desmodium cutting events were fixed at land preparation i.e. at the start of every season, and 4 weeks later, following the recommended practice, while the third cutting was varied and conducted at 9, 12 or 18 weeks after planting maize. Maize yield in the Desmodium-maize intercropping system was only higher than sole maize without urea from the third season. This implies that when P is not limiting inclusion of Desmodium spp. into the maize cropping system would provide a substitute for inorganic N fertilizers to enhance crop growth and yield after Desmodium becomes well established. Cumulative maize grain yield over the four seasons with the D. intortum and D. uncinatum intercrops were 6.3 and 7.0, and 10.9 and 11.6 t ha(-1) in Busia and Siaya, respectively, and significantly higher than or comparable to a maize monocrop (5.8 and 11.8 t ha(-1)). Average net benefits from Desmodium intercropping over the four seasons were increased by 1290 and 918$ ha(-1) relative to the maize monocrop in Busia and Siaya, respectively. Biomass yields were significantly higher for D. intortum than for D. uncinatum. Varying the time of the third Desmodium cutting had little effect on Desmodium biomass yields or maize grain yields in Busia, while in Siaya. D. intortum biomass yields were highest when cut at 12 weeks after planting. In the Desmodium intercropping systems. Striga counts were reduced by 95% in Busia and by 65-90% in Siaya with higher reductions when Desmodium was cut at 18 weeks after planting. In summary, the use of PPT provides robust and high economic benefits to smallholder farmers in western Kenya. The use of D. uncinatum with the third cutting at 18 weeks after planting is recommended, but can be modified according to the need for fodder without much effect on maize yield or revenue.

The productivity of sole or intercropped crops is subject to variety, location, year, and their interaction. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the productivity of newly released common bean varieties NUA45 and SER83 under sole cropping and intercropping with a maize hybrid variety SC672 as a guide to large-scale production. Experiments were conducted at Chitedze Agricultural Research Station (13.85 degrees S; 33.38 degrees E) and Linthipe Extension Planning Area (12.06 degrees S; 33.25 degrees E) in 2019 and 2020 in Malawi using a factorial arrangement laid out in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four replications. The numbers of pods per plant (NPP) and seeds per pod (NSP), grain yield (GYD), and 100-seed weight were collected for common bean included, while GYD was recorded for maize. The main effects for genotype, location, year, and intercropping system were significant (p < 0.05) for GYD in common bean. The effects of the year and cropping system and location by intercropping system interaction were significant for maize GYD. The maize yield did not vary between sole cropped and intercropped systems. The total land equivalent ratios (LERs) for NUA45 and SER83 were 1.59 and 1.77, respectively. The LER-values showed a significant difference (p < 0.034), suggesting a considerably higher benefit of maize and common bean intercropping. Overall, intercropping maize with common bean rendered higher yields in the SER83/SC672 intercropping system than the sole crop in the study areas. Therefore, intra-row intercropping of the newly released common bean variety SER83 with a maize hybrid variety SC672 is recommended in the study area and other similar agro-ecologies for stable and sustainable production of both crops."

Merr] Relay Strip Intercropping System	LEGUME RESEARCH			English	Article						"Maize-soybean relay strip intercropping; Plant growth regulators; Soybean; Yield"	"TOLERANCE; MODEL"	Background: The shading caused by maize inhibited the growth of soybean, reduced the yield of soybean under maize-soybean relay strip intercropping system. To investigate whether foliar spraying different types of plant growth regulators could improve the growth and yield of intercropped soybean. Methods: A field experiment was conducted in 2018 to evaluate the effect of foliar spraying 6BA (6-benzylaminopurine), S3307 (uniconazole) and DTA-6 (diethyl aminoethyl hexanoate), at the soybean beginning flowering stage, on the growth and yield of three soybean varieties [i.e., Nandou 25 (ND25), Gongqiu 8 (GQ8) and Guixia 3 (GX3)]. Result: The leaf area index of three soybean varieties were highest in DTA-6 at 35 days after spraying (DAS) and no significant difference (p<0.05) were observed among three plant growth regulators. The chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b content under 6BA and DTA-6 treatments were significantly higher than CK and S3307 at 35 DAS. The activities of antioxidant enzymes [i.e., SOD (Superoxide dismutase) and CAT (Catalase)] and antioxidant substances [i.e., GSH (Glutathione)] were increased after spraying 6BA, S3307 and DTA-6 in three soybean varieties at 35 DAS. Independent soybean varieties, foliar spraying 6BA, S3307 and DTA-6 increased the soybean yield, pods per plant, 100-grains weight and grain per plant and the effect of DTA-6 (60 mg L-1) treatment were best than others.

AFLP analyses of 130 individuals from two mixed and two pure strands of the parental species resulted in a matrix of 337 polymorphic loci that was analysed with Bayesian cluster algorithms implemented in the software programmes Structure and NewHybrids. The results, together with sequence polymorphisms of the nrDNA ITS1 + 5.8S region, indicate that the three taxa are distinctly separated and that only a few F2-hybrids and no backcrosses to the parental species are present in the surveyed mixed stands. These findings were corroborated by HPLC studies of the phenolic compounds from bark samples that were carried out for the same individuals. A multivariate statistical analysis of relative peak areas of chromatograms (PCA, principal component analysis) indicates the clear separation of parental and the intermediate position of S. x rubens individuals.

Dynamic interactions within the soil-microbial community in a cereal-legume intercropping ecosystem influence the composition and structure of N-cycling microbial groups (e.g. nitrogen-fixing bacteria). However, these effects have not been extensively studied in some intercropping patterns or in response to varying nitrogen fertilization levels. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of reduced and conventional nitrogen application in a sweet maize (Zea may L.)/soybean (Glycine max L.) strip intercropping system under three cropping patterns over a 3-year time period. High-throughput sequencing and quantitative PCR techniques were used to investigate changes to both the microbial community structure and the expression of key nitrogen-cycling genes in the rhizosphere. Our results indicate that reduced nitrogen application affected the microbial community structure in the rhizosphere, but microbial diversity in the sweet maize rhizosphere was relatively stable. Both the abundance and activity of functional marker genes for microbial nitrogen fixation (nifH), nitrification (amoA), denitrification (nirS, nirK, nosZ), and decomposition (chiA) increased significantly from 2013 to 2016. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the quantified shifts in the soil microbial community and the observed increases in the expression of key functional genes involved in N-cycling were the result of reduced nitrogen application in this strip intercropping system. This study, therefore, provides essential insight into the potential relationships between functional nitrogen-cycling genes and mitigation of nitrogen-loss and N2O emissions in a cereal-legume strip intercropping system.

Maize-grain legume intercropping is an attractive option for ecological intensification that reduces climatic risk for smallholder farmers in central Mozambique	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Maize-grain legume intercropping; Intensification; Extensification; Crop productivity; Profitability; Climatic risk"	"SOIL FERTILITY; CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; RESOURCE CAPTURE; SYSTEMS; YIELD; CROP; COWPEA; STRIGA; DECOMPOSITION; CONSTRAINTS"	"Many farmers in central Mozambique intercrop maize with grain legumes as a means to improve food security and income. The objective of this study was to understand the farming system, and to evaluate the suitability of maize-legume intercropping to alleviate the biophysical and socio-economic constraints faced by smallholder farmers in Ruaca and Vunduzi villages, central Mozambique. To achieve this we characterised the farming systems and measured grain yields, rainfall infiltration, economic returns and acceptability of maize-legume intercrops under different N and P application rates. Two intercropping strategies were tested: (a) an additive design of within-row intercropping in which legume was inter-cropped with alternating hills of maize within the same row; maize plant population was the same as sole crop maize, and (b) a substitutive design with distinct alternating rows of maize and legume (local practice). Fertiliser treatments imposed on all treatments were: (i) no fertiliser, (ii) 20 kg P ha(-1), (iii) 20 kg P ha(-1) + 30 kg N ha(-1), and (iv) 20 kg P ha(-1) + 60 kg N ha(-1). Intercrops were relatively more productive than the corresponding sole crops; land equivalent ratios (LER) for within-row intercropping ranged between 1.1 and 2.4, and between 1.0 and 1.9 for distinct-row intercropping. Average maize yield penalty for intercropping maize and pigeonpea in the within-row was small (8%) compared with 50% in the distinct-row design; average (season x fertiliser) sole maize yield was 3.2 t ha(-1). Intercropping maize and cowpea in within-row led to maize yield loss of only 6%, whereas distinct-row intercropping reduced maize yield by 25% from 2.1 t ha(-1) of sole maize (season x fertiliser). Cowpea yield was less affected by intercropping: sole cowpea had an average yield of 0.9 t ha(-1), distinct-row intercropping (0.8 t ha(-1)) and the within-row intercropping yielded 0.9 t ha(-1). Legumes were comparatively less affected by the long dry spells which were prevalent during the study period. Response to N and P fertiliser was weak due to poor rainfall distribution. In the third season, maize in rotation with pigeonpea and without N fertiliser application yielded 5.6 t ha(-1), eight times more than continuous maize which was severely infested by striga (Striga asiatica) and yielded only 0.7 t ha(-1). Rainfall infiltration increased from 6 mm h(-1) to 22 mm h(-1) with long-term maize-legume intercropping due to a combination of good quality biomass production which provided mulch combined with no tillage. Intercropping maize and pigeonpea was profitable with a rate of return of at least 343% over sole maize cropping. Farmers preferred the within-row maize-legume intercropping with an acceptability score of 84% because of good yields for both maize and legume. Intercropping increased the labour required for weeding by 36% compared with the sole crops. Farmers in Ruaca faced labour constraints due to extensification thus maize-pigeonpea intercropping may improve productivity and help reduce the area cultivated. In Vunduzi, land limitation was a major problem and intensification through legumes is amongst the few feasible options to increase both production and productivity. The late maturity of pigeonpea means that free-grazing of cattle has to be delayed, which allows farmers to retain crop residues in the fields as mulch if they choose to; this allows the use of no-tillage practises. We conclude that maize-legume intercropping has potential to: (a) reduce the risk of crop failure, (b) improve productivity and income, and (c) increase food security in vulnerable production systems, and is a feasible entry point to ecological intensification.

Row configuration affects how many crop rows interact with the same species and how many rows interact with the other species, shaping the expression of plasticity, resource capture, and growth. This study aims to determine how row configuration influences radiation interception and productivity in wheat maize intercropping under western European growing conditions. Field experiments with different row configurations were carried out in 2013 and 2014 in the Netherlands. We compared seven treatments, comprising sole crops of wheat and maize (SW and SM), a replacement intercrop (6:2WM), skip-row designs (6:0WM, 0:2WM) and add-row designs (6:3WM, 8:2WM). We determined leaf area and biomass dynamics over time, and developed a simple geometry-based model to estimate light capture in these different row configurations. The model was tested with light measurements in the field. Crop radiation use efficiency (RUE) was estimated by linear regression of above-ground biomass on the calculated cumulative intercepted light (photosynthetically active radiation-PAR). This study showed that: 1) wheat-maize intercropping had significantly higher PAR interception than sole wheat in 2013 and 2014, and sole maize in 2013, but not in 2014; 2) intercropping significantly increased RUE of wheat, whereas it significantly decreased RUE of maize; 3) both light interception and light use efficiency changed with planting configuration. Thus we showed that the row configuration of the intercrop affected light interception as well as light use efficiency by modulating the strength of competitive and compensatory interactions within and between crop species.

Under relay intercropping combinations, potato tuber yield reduced by 1.5-25.8 % compared to sole potato, depending on kind of row proportion and planting geometries of maize. Amongst different relay intercropping combinations of potato in maize, 1 row of potato within paired rows of maize (40/80 cm) and 2 rows of potato in between 2 paired rows of maize (40/80 cm) was found to be the best in terms of potato tuber yield (19 389 kg/ha) which was on a par with sole potato (19 675 kg/ha). Relay intercropping of potato maize paired rows (40/80 or 40/60 cm) gave maize yield at par with sole maize. Similarly, maize yield also did not differ significantly due to different relay intercropping treatments. All the relay intercropping combinations enhanced the total production in terms of maize-equivalent yield by 1.6-2.1 times over paired rows (40/60 cm) of maize sole (7 089 kg/ha).

Relay intercropping of 1 row potato within paired rows of maize and 2 rows of potato between 2 paired rows of maize (40/80 cm) recorded the highest maize-equivalent yield (21 908 kg/ha), gross returns (Rs 109 538/ha), net returns (Rs 49 538/ha), benefit : cost ratio (1.83) and land-equivalent ratio (1.98).

J	"Undi, M; Kawonga, KC; Musendo, RM"				"Undi, M; Kawonga, KC; Musendo, RM"			Nutritive value of maize stover/pasture legume mixtures as dry season supplementation for sheep	SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH			English	Article						"maize stover; pasture legumes; intake; preference; sheep"	STOVER	Two experiments were carried out to determine the nutrient contents and relative preferences of maize stover and three legumes forages and their feeding on intake and digestibility of sheep. Maize stover was blended with three legumes, style (Stylosanthes guainensis), siratro (Macroptilium atropurpureum) and centro (Centrocema pubescens), to produce four treatments, namely, only maize stover (control), stover/stylo, stover/siratro and stover/centro mixtures. The first experiment evaluated the relative preference of the stover and the various stover/legume mixtures when offered to sheep. Six rams were offend pair combinations of the treatments in a 6 x 6 Latin square with a split plot arrangement such that each ram had access to two feeds at a time in each period of 6 days. The second experiment included measurements of intake and digestibility of the stover and stover/legume mixtures. Four intact and four castrated male sheep were used in two, 4 x 4 Latin squares with 21-day periods. The least (P < 0.05) preferred feed was maize stover when it was offered as the sole feed. There were no significant differences in preference among the stover/legume mixtures. Dry matter intake (DMI) was highest (P < 0.05) when sheep were offered the stover/centro mixture and lowest (P < 0.05) when maize stover was fed as the sole feed. Dry matter digestibility did not differ significantly among treatments. Sheep that were offend maize stover only lost weight, those fed stover/centro gained weight and those that were fed either stover/siratro or stover/stylo maintained weight. However, these short-term weight changes may reflect changes in fill as much as changes in body tissue. Addition of legumes to maize stover improved the nutritive value, possibly by increasing the nitrogen content of the stover. The results suggest that maize stover, which is normally left to rot in the field, could be better utilised by intercropping with legumes and allowing animals access after grain harvest. <(c)> 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	"HUSSEIN, MY; SAMAD, NA"				"HUSSEIN, MY; SAMAD, NA"			INTERCROPPING CHILLI WITH MAIZE OR BRINJAL TO SUPPRESS POPULATIONS OF APHIS-GOSSYPII GLOV, AND TRANSMISSION OF CHILLI VIRUSES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEST MANAGEMENT			English	Article						"CHILLI; MAIZE; AUBERGINE; APHIS-GOSSYPII; MALAYSIA"		A 2-year field trial was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of intercropping in suppressing Aphis gossypii, a vector of chilli veinal mottle virus (CVMV) which causes severe damage to chilli plants (Capsicum annuum). One monocrop (chilli only) and two dicrops (chilli and maize, or chilli and brinjal) treatments were tested. No insecticides or fungicides were applied but pre-emergence weedicides and other normal cultural practices were applied as recommended. The parameters used to compare the treatments were vector abundance, virus infection, plant height and fruit yield. The results showed that populations of A. gossypii found on the chilli plants were significantly (P < 0.05) larger in plots where chilli were grown as monocrop rather than as dicrops. Brinjal (Solanum melongena) seemed to perform better than maize (Zea mays) as a companion crop in protecting chilli plants from vector colonization and virus infection. Plant density appeared to have an influence on the vector abundance and virus spread as resources were limited, thus hampering vector movements in the intercropping system. Overall, CVMV infection was higher as the virus spread faster in chilli monoculture than dicultures involving either maize or brinjal. Trap catches of winged (alate) vectors also indicate that the vectors were more abundant and actively spreading the disease in the monocrop. No significant (P > 0.05) decrease or increase in the heights of chilli plants grown in the dicropping system was detected. Yields of fresh and marketable chillies were signifiantly higher when chilli plants were interplanted with either maize or brinjal. Brinjal was found to be the better companion crop, while maize could be used as a substitute. Brinjal was effective as a trap crop for those vectors migrating early, and also in diluting the vector population. Maize, on the other hand, acted as a barrier crop and was effective in reducing vector movement within a plot and also preventing winged vectors from landing on chilli plants. The study has demonstrated that a change in the cropping pattern or vegetational diversity could change the vector abundance and distribution while reducing virus transmission and spread.

Twelve farmers hosted on-farm trials per district, in three districts, with each farmer having six plots. The design of the study was randomised complete block design arranged in a split plot fashion with tillage as main plot and cropping systems as sub-plots, with each farmer acting as a replicate. CA had 1400 and 3200 kg ha(-1) more maize grain yield in the second and third seasons, respectively compared with CT. In the first two seasons, CT had 310, 180 and 270 kg ha(-1) more cowpea, soybean and pigeon pea grain yields in Salima, Mzimba and Mangochi districts, respectively, compared with CA. Similarly, CA had 1100 and 950 kg ha(-1) more groundnut grain yields than CT in Salima and Mzimba districts in the second and third seasons, respectively. Over the three-year study period, partial land equivalent ratio for maize ranged from 0.78 to 1.24. Largest net returns were achieved by intercropping maize with pigeon pea in Mangochi and rotating maize and groundnut in Mzimba and Salima districts.

Lemon, Kinnow, Grapefruit and Musambi intercropped with and without maize were selected for recording data on these insects. Percent leaf miner infestation and number of predators were recorded from randomly selected branches of citrus trees. Results showed that intercropped plots of each variety had low infestation of citrus miner and high population of coccinellids and Chrysoperla carnea when compared with Tuckey's Test at p<0.05. The mean CLM infestation on Kinnow and Musambi was 8.40 +/- 0.144 and 12.72 +/- 0.171 in intercropped and 9.12 +/- 0.169 and 14.52 +/- 0.200 in wihtout intercropped plots, respectively. Interaction of population of Chrysoperla carnea and coccinellids was non-significant for months, varieties and intercropping but was significant within months, varieties and intercropping.

However, few studies have focused on the effects of root morphological and physiological changes during the recovery growth of late-maturing species. The present study aimed to determine the mechanism underlying the recovery growth in terms of root distribution and nitrogen (N) uptake in response to different N supplies. Methods The roots of maize were sampled three times by auger after wheat harvest in the intercropping system with six levels of N application and sole crops at one N-application rate under field condition. Results Intercropped maize adjusted its root length density (RLD) and root distribution and enhanced its N absorption per unit root length with increasing soil N concentration. Soil inorganic N concentration had a direct influence on RLD of intercropped maize which was related to shoot N concentration. In addition, maize took up 93% more N per unit root length when intercropped with maize compared with sole cropping. Conclusions Our findings show that the recovery growth of late-maturing species involves phenotypic plasticity of maize root architecture, and the enhanced N uptake resulted from extra soil N acquired from the area where wheat was growing before its harvest.

However, the physiological and anatomical mechanisms of grain yield increase at high plant densities in maize-based intercropping systems are not well understood. A two-year field experiment was conducted in 2018 and 2019 to investigate grain yield, photosynthetic characteristics, stomatal traits, and leaf anatomy of maize plants in an intercrop-ping system with high plant densities. Two cropping patterns (monocropping and intercropping) and three plant densities (D1, 78,000 plants ha -1; D2, 103,500 plants ha -1; D3, 129,000 plants ha -1) were arranged in a randomized block design. Increasing maize plant density significantly increased maize yield, and intercropping gave a significant yield advantage over monocropping under the same plant den-sity. Intercropping combined with high plant density increased the leaf area and SPAD value of maize, increasing the photosynthesis rates after the harvest of pea. At the twelfth leaf stage, the stomatal density and stomatal area of intercrops combined with medium plant density increased by respectively 10.5% and 18.4% relative to their values for the corresponding density of monocrops. Although leaf thickness of maize was reduced by increasing plant density, the chloroplast number and grana lamella number were higher in intercropping than in monocropping under different plant densities. These positive changes in leaf anatomy resulted in increased photosynthesis, suggesting a physiological basis for the increase in grain yield.(c) 2021 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS.

The effect of maize-alfalfa intercropping on the physiological characteristics, nitrogen uptake and yield of maize	PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						"chlorophyll content; intracellular CO2; photosynthetic activity; stomatal conductance; transpiration rate"	"USE EFFICIENCY; SYSTEM; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; RHIZOSPHERE; WHEAT/MAIZE; PRODUCTIVITY; FACILITATION; INOCULATION; ACQUISITION; PHOSPHORUS"	In Northeastern China, the intensive cropping system and increased use of chemical fertilizer has caused severe problems in terms of sustainable agricultural development. Therefore, to improve agricultural sustainability and crop productivity the farming system needs to be modified in the region. A pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of maize-alfalfa intercropping on the physiological characteristics, nitrogen (N) uptake and yield of the maize crops in northeast China in 2017-2018. The study findings showed that intercropping under N fertilization progressively improved the physio-agronomic indices of the maize crop as compared to mono-cropping. The grain yield, 100 seed weight and biomass dry matter of maize crop improved in intercropping when it was practiced with N fertilizer. Furthermore, intercropping with N fertilization increased the chlorophyll content of the maize crop at bell-mouthed, silking, filing and mature stages by 19%, 44%, 12%, and 9% in 2017 and by 23%, 43%, 15%, and 11% in 2018, respectively, as compared with the monocropping system. Unlike monocropping, intercropping with N fertilization increased the photosynthesis rate (14% and 15%), stomatal conductance (74% and 98%) and transpiration rate (74% and 75%) in 2017 and 2018, respectively. However, intercropping reduced intercellular CO2(C-i). Moreover, intercropping with N fertilization increased the maize N content of grain and leaves as well as total N uptake by 49%, 31% and 93% in 2017 and 53%, 34% and 132%, respectively, in 2018 as compared to monocropping. In conclusion, our results suggest that maize-alfalfa intercropping with optimal N fertilization provides a practical method for improving growth, yield and N accumulation in the maize crop.

J	Ijoyah, MO				Ijoyah, M. O.			Yield effects of intercropping white guinea yam (Dioscoreae rotundata P.) minisetts and maize (Zea mays L.) in the southern Guinea savanna of Nigeria	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						"White guinea yam; minisetts; maize; intercropping; Nigeria"		Field experiments were conducted from May to October during 2003 and 2004 cropping seasons at the Research Farm, University of Agriculture, Makurdi, Benue State, Nigeria, to evaluate the yield effects of intercropping white Guinea yam (minisetts) and maize and to assess the advantages of the intercropping system. Maize yield was not significantly affected by intercropping with yam-minisett. However, tuber yield of yam-minisetts intercropped with maize was significantly (P <= 0.05) depressed by 15.0 and 16.3% respectively, in 2003 and 2004 compared to monocultured yam-minisett. However, total yield was greater than the component crop yield, either planted as sole or in mixture. Intercropping yam-minisett and maize gave land equivalent ratio (LER) values of 1.98 and 1.95 respectively, for years 2003 and 2004, thus, indicating that higher productivity per unit area was achieved by growing the two crops together than by growing them separately. With these LER values, 49.5 and 48.7% of land was saved respectively, in 2003 and 2004, which could be used for other agricultural purposes. In addition, maize was about three-quarters as competitive as yam-minisett, indicating that both crops are complimentary and suitable in mixture.

Diversified cropping systems are known to influence pest populations, however, how neighboring habitats affect pest population dynamics is not clear. This study focused on understanding the influence of wetland borders on Fall Armyworm (FAW) and wasps prevalence in a maize-soybean intercrop system in Eastern Uganda. FAW and wasps population estimates were carried out in twelve farmers' fields stratified within 0-300 and 500-1100 meters from the wetland borderline. Data were collected biweekly from emergence until post flower growth of the crops. Results showed the prevalence of FAW was significantly higher on maize-soybean fields 500-1100 meters compared to those within 0 to 300 m from the wetland borders. While the prevalence of wasps was significantly higher in the crops at 82-219 meters from wetland borderline. It is concluded that wetland borders play a crucial role in negatively affecting crop pest populations while positively influencing natural enemy populations and these effects are influenced by distance of crop fields from the wetland border.

To date, this transfer has been shown only where mineral N is applied shortly before harvest, and hence is readily available. We have yet to demonstrate VAM-mediated N transfer where soil-N is limiting, a condition under which most traditional legume-nonlegume intercrops are grown. In this study, N-15-enriched soil (with 0.28%N) was used to distinguish between the uptake of soil- and atmospherically-derived N in maize grown with beans in the presence or absence of VAM fungi. VAM infection did not result in transfer of fixed N or soil N from bean to maize, despite a VAM-stimulated increase in N fixation in bean. In fact, beans were more competitive for soil N when mycorrhizal. N content in beans increased by 75% with a concomitant 22% decrease in mg N per maize plant. The competitive effect may have resulted from a VAM-mediated shift in carbon allocation in beans (but not maize) from shoots to roots.

However, maize root morphological plasticity and N uptake capability response to gravity in the intercropping system remains to be determined. In this study, maize was grown under 20 cm (I-20), 40 cm (I-40), and 60 cm (I-60) of narrow row spacing in an intercropping system (maize-soybean strip relay intercropping) and equal row spacing of monoculture (M) in a 2-year field experiment. As a supplementary for the field experiment, maize root barrier and plant inclination experiments were conducted. Plant inclination, brace root morphology, N uptake, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) level, IAA synthesis genes, and grain yield were assessed. The result showed that the plant inclination increased with decreasing narrow row spacing in intercropping system. Also, the brace unilateral root growth ratio (BURR) increased with increasing plant inclination in intercropping treatments. The plant inclination experiment showed the BURR achieved 94% after inclination at 45 degrees. BURR tended to be positively correlated (p = 0.00) with plant inclination. Thus, gravity (plant inclination) causes brace unilateral root growth. The IAA concentration of stem nodes in the wide row increased with increasing plant inclination, while the IAA accumulation decreased in the narrow row. The Zmvt2 and ZM2G141383 genes (associated with IAA biosynthesis) were highly expressed in a wide row. There was a strong correlation (p = 0.03) between the IAA concentration of wide row and the BURR. Therefore, gravity regulates the IAA level, which affects BURR. In addition, the brace root number, volume, and surface area were decreased when BURR was increased. Subsequently, the leaf N, cob N, and kernel N accumulation were reduced. These organs N and grain yield in I-60 were not significantly different as compared to the control treatment. The excessive brace unilateral root growth was not conducive to N uptake and increased yield. Our results suggest that gravity is essential in regulating root morphology plasticity by regulating IAA levels and decreasing N uptake capacity. Furthermore, these results indicate that plant inclination can regulate root phenotype and N uptake of maize and by adjusting the spacing of narrow maize row, we can improve the N uptake and yield of the maize-soybean strip relay-intercropping system.

Five legume cover crops (Pueraria phaseoloides (Roxb) Benths, Stylosanthes guianensis (Aubl.) Sw., Mucuna pruriens (L.) Dc var. utilis Wall ex Wight, Mucuna preta and Mucuna jaspeada] with a no legume cover as control were used as a sub-treatment in an integrated weed management in maize/cassava intercrop. The study was carried out at the Teaching and Research Farm of the University of Ilorin in 2002 and 2004. Significantly lower weed densities were obtained under S. guianensis and M. pruriens var. utilis (7.83 and 8.08 weeds/m(2), respectively) compared with densities in P. phaseoloides (9.87 weeds/m(2)), M. jaspeada (9.37 weeds/m(2)) and M. preta (11.71 weeds/m(2)) plots at 12WAP. Mucuna preta produced the highest ground cover at 10WAP while M. pruiens (var utilis) had the highest ground cover at 16WAP in 2002. In 2004, M. jaspeada produced the highest ground cover at both 10 and 16WAP (59.6 and 91.0% respectively). Total weed density was significantly reduced under S. guianensis and M. pruriens var. utilis at 48WAP in 2004. There was no significant difference in the yield of maize in the various legume cover crops plots in both years while average yield of fresh cassava tuber was significant in M. preta plots.

As part of the effort to evolve proven agronomic package for such intercropping, two experiments were carried out between 2000 and 2002. Experiment I which was carried out between 2000 and 2001 was with two factors (a) four fertilizer combinations (organic kraal manure 0, 50 and 100 t/ha and NPK 300 kg/ha) and (b) three crop combinations (sole maize at 40,000 plants/ha, sole beans at 175,439 plants/ha and maize/bean intercrop at 75% maize and 25% bean). The trial was a factorial experiment laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications. This experiment was repeated during the next season without fertilizer treatments as Experiment 2. Fertilization, whether organic or inorganic, was found to enhance morphological parameters for both maize and Phaseolus bean when grown sole or intercropped. Kraal manure (100 t/ha) and NPK fertilizer (300 kg/ha) gave significantly higher total dry matter yields than the control treatment in sole maize and sole beans by 34 and 33% respectively. Intercropped maize and bean grown with kraal manure at 100 t/ha gave higher total dry matter yields than intercropped maize and bean grown without fertilizer by 24 and 45% respectively. Optimum grain yields were obtained at 300 kg/ha NPK (10.8 t/ha) for sole maize and at 50 t/ha kraal manure (8.0 t/ha) for intercropped maize and these yields were higher than those of control by 46 and 45% respectively. As for the sole bean, optimum seed yields were obtained at 50 t/ha kraal manure (3.2 t/ha) while 100 t/ha kraal manure gave optimum yield for intercropped bean (0.98 t/ha). These values were higher than the values obtained under the control treatment by 13 and 49% respectively. Grain yields of sole and intercropped maize in plots previously applied with organic manure (100 t/ha) had 40 and 83% increase in the second year while maize previously fertilized with inorganic fertilizer (NPK) had grain yield reduction of 5 and 50% for sole and intercropped maize respectively. The same trend was observed for the yields of beans. The importance of organic manure and its long time usefulness in increasing productivity of maize/bean intercrop for small-scale farmers in Eastern Cape of South Africa was highlighted by the study.

This study used 12 maize hybrids with different genetic backgrounds. Planting was carried out for two seasons using four cropping systems. Hybrids were selected according to their adaptability and stability based on parametric, nonparametric, and multivariate analyses. The results showed that G10 had high yield for all cropping systems. G10 was also selected as an adaptive hybrid for sole-cropping, whereas G9 was selected as an adaptive hybrid for intercropping. The L5 and L4 were ideal environments for evaluating hybrids under different cropping systems. The selected hybrids should be evaluated and disseminated for smallholder farmers in Indonesia.

Sixty four percent of the surveyed fields were intercropped with the proportion of maize ranging from 24% to 68%. Rust incidence and severity among the areas and between years varied. Logistic regression was used to analyse the association of the diseases with cropping systems and practices, geographic area, season and altitude. Crop density, sowing date, variety, area, cropping system and year were significantly associated with rust incidence in a multiple variable model. Low rust incidence had a high probability of association to low crop density, early and optimum sowing, maize-bean intercropping and the 1998 cropping season. High rust incidence had a high probability of association to the Habro area, hybrid varieties and maize-sorghum intercropping. Cropping year and proportion of maize in intercrops were significantly associated with rust severity in a multiple variable model. The severity of rust was higher where the proportion of maize in the intercrop was 25-50%. The Habro area and the 1998 season had a high probability of association with high rust severity. Crop density, altitude and sowing date were significantly associated with LB incidence in a multiple variable model. Sowing at an optimum time had a high probability of association with low (< 25%) LB incidence. At low crop density and lower altitude LB was increased. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We also determined some agronomic practices that may influence stemborer infestation and identified the stemborer control methods used. Pests reported included chafer grubs, stemborers, termites, 'red ants', yellow-necked spur fowls, squirrels, monkeys, porcupines, rats, wild pigs and storage insect pests. Their relative importance in each AEZ is discussed. The squirrel was the most widely distributed and important vertebrate pest of maize in the study AEZs. Stemborers infested maize in all the zones, and ranked first among insect pests in the Upper Midland zone 4 (UM4), Lower Midland zone 3 (LM3) and LM4, and second in LM5, but were unimportant in UM2. Agronomic practices that may influence stemborer infestation in maize, including cropping system, sowing time, fertilizer/manure use, stover storage usage and disposal and maize varieties are discussed. Most farmers preferred local to improved maize varieties, and maize was mostly grown as an intercrop. This emphasizes the need for more research effort to identify pests and develop pest management technologies in local maize varieties, contrary to the current research agenda which has focussed on improved varieties. Pest management technologies developed also should be compatible with intercropping before dissemination to farmers. Farmers use insecticides, wood ash, soil, saw dust, chilli pepper powder, dry cell powder and mexican marigold (Tagetes minuta) to control stemborers.

Here we reveal that leaf-removal from maize-canopy improves the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) transmittance and dry-matter production (DMP) of soybean (especially during the co-growth phase), and compensates the maize seed-yield loss by considerably increasing soybean seed-yield. In a two-year experiment with MSR, maize-plants were subjected to different leaf-removal treatments to increase the PAR-transmittance of soybean; removal of the topmost two-leaves (R2), four-leaves (R4), six-leaves (R6), with no-removal of leaves (R0). Leaf-removal treatments improved the PAR-transmittance, photosynthetic-rate, and morphological-characteristics of soybean under MSR. At 90 days after sowing, the dry-matter of pods, and seeds was increased by 25%, and 32%, respectively under R6 than R0. Importantly, enhanced PAR-transmittance and DMP under R6 enabled soybean to initiate a greater number of flowers 182.2 plant(-1) compared to 142.7 plant(-1 )under R0, and it also decreased the flower-abscission (by 13%, from 54.9% under R0 to 47.6% under R6). These positive responses increased the pod-number by 49% and seed-number by 28% under R6 than R0. Overall, under R6, relay-intercropped soybean produced 78% of sole-soybean seed-yield, and relay-intercropped maize produced 81% of sole-maize seed-yield and achieved the land equivalent ratio of 1.59."

Don.; eastern Africa; green manure; intercropping; maize-bean cropping systems; maize; soil physical properties"	"BIOLOGICAL NITROGEN-FIXATION; PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS L; GRAIN LEGUMES; COVER CROPS; SOIL; MINERALIZATION; RESIDUE; AFRICA"	"Crotalaria (C. ochroleuca G. Don.) used as a green manure may improve the productivity of maize-bean cropping systems in eastern Africa. To test this hypothesis, three field studies were conducted over three consecutive cropping seasons at Kawanda Agricultural Research Institute in Uganda. In the first season, crotalaria biomass was produced in pure stands or in intercrop systems with either common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) or maize (Zea mays L.) as companion crops. Crotalaria was sown at planting and three weeks after planting the food crops. The biomass of early planted crotalaria was mulched, that of late planted crotalaria was incorporated into the soil at planting of the following crop. The first subsequent crop was maize, and the second was either beans (in two seasons) or maize (in one season). In the crotalaria production season, mean yield losses of maize through intercropping with early or late sown crotalaria were 40 and 22%, respectively; the corresponding values for beans were 45 and 14%, In the first cropping season after crotalaria production, the increase in maize grain yield on account of crotalaria averaged 39%; the best response (68% increase) to crotalaria was obtained with early sown sole crotalaria applied as mulch. Major differences in soil mineral nitrogen content among the treatments occurred at the six-leaf stage of maize only. In the second cropping season following crotalaria production, the mean increases in seed yields of beans or maize, due to crotalaria, were 23 and 19%, respectively, indicating a considerable residual effect of crotalaria green manure. The decrease in bulk density, and the increase in water infiltration capacity of the soil suggest that the yield stimulation because of crotalaria not only resulted from the increased nitrogen supply, but also from more favorable soil physical properties. Considering the competitive effect of crotalaria with the food crops and the positive effect on yields of subsequent crops, two options are especially promising: incorporation of crotalaria produced by relay intercropping with beans and mulching of early sown crotalaria produced in pure stands.

However, the structure mechanism in canopy is still unclear. We conducted a two-year field experiment on runoff plots, exploring whether the interaction between vegetation layers reduce soil erosion in maize and potato intercropping systems. The maize, potato, and weed layers in the intercropping system were removed by a single layer, two layers and three layers, respectively (total of 8 treatments including all layers removed as the control). Then, throughfall, runoff and sediment were measured at the plot and row scale on a weekly basis. Based on the difference between each treatment and the control, we calculated and found a relative reduction of runoff and sediment by any combination of the two vegetation layers greater than the sum of each single layer. In 2016 and 2017, the highest relative reduction of runoff reached 15.65% and 46.73%, respectively. Sediment loss decreased by 33.96% and 42.77%, respectively. Moreover, runoff and sediment reduced by the combination of all vegetation layers (no layers removed) was also larger than the sum of that by each single layer. In 2016 and 2017, the highest relative reduction of runoff reached 7.32% and 3.48%, respectively. So, there were synergistic effects among multi-level (two or three layers) vegetation layers in terms of decreasing soil erosion on sloping land. Maize redistributes more throughfall at the maize intra-specific row and the maize and potato inter-specific, which is favorable for the synergistic effect of reducing soil erosion. This finding shows an important mechanism of maize and potato intercropping for soil and water conservation, and may promote the application of diverse cropping systems for sustainable agriculture in mountainous areas.

A study with a completely randomized block design was performed in 2015 and 2016, with 7 x 2 + 1 split plot and three replications in a clayey Red Oxisol. Seven intercropping systems were allocated to each plot, and two crotalaria species (Crotalaria spectabilis and C. ochroleuca) cultivated with maize in monoculture were allocated to each subplot. Crotalaria yield, total chlorophyll content, nitrogen content, plant height, plant dry matter, thousand grain mass, and corn grain yield were evaluated. C. spectabilis was more sensitive to water level variations during the crop cycle than C. ochroleuca. Crotalaria sown before maize planting with maize seeds incorporated in the soil presented a relatively higher phytomass but decreased corn grain yield. The management system in which crotalaria was sown in the inter-row with a ridge planter at the time of maize planting and the system in which crotalaria was sown in the maize sowing furrow were feasible for straw production because they did not decrease corn grain yield and did not affect maize harvesting operations.

A climate-adapted push-pull system effectively controls fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J E Smith), in maize in East Africa	CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						"Climate-smart push-pull; Fall armyworm; Management; Maize; Africa"	"CHILO-PARTELLUS; BT-MAIZE; MANAGEMENT; LEPIDOPTERA; RESISTANCE; NOCTUIDAE; FIELD; INSECTICIDES; PARASITISM; STRATEGY"	Fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J E Smith), an economically important pest native to tropical and subtropical America has recently invaded Africa, causing substantial damage to maize and other crops. We evaluated functionality of a companion cropping system, 'climate-adapted push-pull', developed for control of cereal stemborers in drier agro-ecologies, as an added tool for the management of fall armyworm. The technology comprises intercropping maize with drought-tolerant greenleaf desmodium, Desmodiwn intortwn (Mill.) Urb., and planting Brachiaria cv Mulato II as a border crop around this intercrop. Protection to maize is provided by semiochemicals that are emitted by the intercrop that repel (push) stemborer moths while those released by the border crop attract (pull) them. 250 farmers who had adopted the technology in drier areas of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania were randomly selected for the study during the long rainy season (March-August) of 2017. Each farmer had a set of two plots, a climate-adapted push pull and a maize monocrop. Data were collected in each plot on the number of fall armyworm larvae on maize, percentage of maize plants damaged by the larvae and maize grain yields. Similarly, farmers' perceptions of the impact of the technology on the pest were assessed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Reductions of 82.7% in average number of larvae per plant and 86.7% in plant damage per plot were observed in climate-adapted push-pull compared to maize monocrop plots. Similarly, maize grain yields were significantly higher, 2.7 times, in the climate-adapted push-pull plots. Farmers rated the technology significantly superior in reducing fall armyworm infestation and plant damage rates. These results demonstrate that the technology is effective in controlling fall armyworm with concomitant maize grain yield increases, and represent the first documentation of a technology that can be immediately deployed for management of the pest in East Africa and beyond.

The abundance and structure of bacterial communities associated with the roots of amilaceous maize has not been studied in Andean chacras. Accordingly, the main objective of this study was to describe the rhizospheric bacterial diversity of amilaceous maize grown either in the presence or the absence of bur clover cultivated in soils from the Quechua maize belt. Three 16S rRNA gene libraries, one corresponding to sequences of bacteria from bulk soil of a chacra maintained under fallow conditions, the second from the rhizosphere of maize-cultivated soils, and the third prepared from rhizospheric soil of maize cultivated in intercropping with bur clover were examined using pyrosequencing tags spanning the V4 and V5 hypervariable regions of the gene. A total of 26031 sequences were found that grouped into 5955 distinct operational taxonomic units which distributed in 309 genera. The numbers of OTUs in the libraries from the maize-cultivated soils were significantly higher than those found in the libraries from bulk soil. One hundred ninety seven genera were found in the bulk soil library and 234 and 203 were in those from the maize and maize/bur clover-cultivated soils. Sixteen out of the 309 genera had a relative abundance higher than 0.5% and the were (in decreasing order of abundance) Gp4, Gp6, Flavobacterium, Subdivision3 genera incertae sedis of the Verrucomicrobia phylum, Gemmatimonas, Dechloromonas, Ohtaekwangia, Rhodoferax, Gaiella, Opitutus, Gp7, Spartobacteria genera incertae sedis, Terrimonas, Gp5, Steroidobacter and Parcubacteria genera incertae sedis. Genera Gp4 and Gp6 of the Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonas and Rhodoferax were the most abundant in bulk soil, whereas Flavobacterium, Dechloromonas and Ohtaekwangia were the main genera in the rhizosphere of maize intercropped with bur clover, and Gp4, Subdivision3 genera incertae sedis of phylum Verrucomicrobia. Gp6 and Rhodoferax were the main genera in the rhizosphere of maize plants.

This study synthesized and analyzed the maize yield merits of CA systems relative to conventional farmer practices and the contribution of agro-ecological zones, seasonal rainfall regimes and soil characteristics in five Eastern and Southern African (ESA) countries, namely Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania, over a seven-year period. Agronomic data generated from 287 smallholder on-farm trials testing the productivity of CA cropping systems with a total of 4976 observations, were compiled and collated. Across the five countries, the factors country, cropping system, rainfall regime, agro-ecological zones and soil texture, accounted for 51, 20, 16, 10 and 3% of the yield variation, respectively. Furthermore, CA reduced yield variability by 11% (from 67% under conventional tillage to 56%). Across all the ESA environments and relative to conventional tillage with a mean of 2401 kg ha(-1), CA-rotation had the highest maize yield increase (35%) compared with CA-sole (29%) and CA-intercrops (15 %) systems and thus offered the best opportunity for improved maize productivity compared with intercrops, CAsole or conventional filled systems. Furthermore, the highest returns (90-95%) to CA investments by smallholder farmers were realized under low rainfall conditions (< 700 mm), thereby providing clear evidence of the climate smartness of CA systems under soil moisture stressed conditions. These CA yields relative to conventional fill however were subdued to 26, 19 and 15% in medium-wet (700 -1300 mm) and depressed even further to + 1, -18 and + 9% in wet (> 1300 mm) environments, for CA-rotations, CA-sole and CA-intercrops, respectively. The study also showed that the most beneficial effects of CA occurred under loam textured soils. In addition, CA systems responded best (16%) on well drained soils yet depressed yields by 33% on poorly drained soils. We conclude that the prime conditions for CA performance relative to conventional tillage, involve use of CA-rotations, low rainfall (< 700 mm) conditions, medium textured loam and well drained soils.

GUINEA GRASS (P-MAXIMUM JACQ)	CUBAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						"INTERCROPPING; FORAGE SORGHUM; MAIZE; SOYBEAN; GLYCINE; GUINEA GRASS"		An experiment was carried out in a montmorillonitic soil to study intercropping of different cultures in guinea grass establishment. A random block design with 4 replications was used. The treatments were the intercropping of maize, soybean and sorghum forage at pasture sowing. The highest accumulated yield (15,86 t DM/ha) was obtained when sorghum was intercropped in guinea grass followed by soybean guinea grass system (12,15 t DM/ha) while the control treatment produced 10,3 t DM/ha. The area covered by pasture showed a decrease of guinea grass percentage with the sorghum-guinea grass system in the first cut which disappeared at the end of the experiment. Soybean offered the highest protein percentage, digestibility, calcium and phosphorus contents. It is concluded that sorghum intercropping when guinea grass is sown originates a higher yield without affecting the basic pasture and a second choice would be soybean intercropping in guinea grass due to the quality of the product. Further studies on sowing dosages, intercropping time in these systems are recommended.

Since maize is a highly efficient and economic crop, it is cultivated on large areas in Germany, with a high share in crop rotation, especially where cattle farming takes place. Such landscapes provide less habitat and food resources for small vertebrates and arthropods. Intercropping maize with flowering partners might have a positive effect on the environment and might promote biodiversity in agricultural ecosystems. Therefore, in two-year field experiments on three sites in south-western Germany, plants were tested for their suitability as intercropping partners in maize crops (Medicago sativa, Melilotus officinalis, Vicia sativa, Tropaeolum majus, Cucurbita pepo, and Phaseolus vulgaris). Almost all tested partners produced flowers, except M. officinalis. Intercropping maize with P. vulgaris or T. majus achieved comparable dry matter yields as sole maize, without changes in the biomass quality. For maize-intercropping, site adapted weed control and practicable sowing technique are mandatory, which already exist for P. vulgaris and T. majus. The study shows that intercropping maize with biodiversity-enhancing flowering partners can provide an applicable alternative to sole maize cropping and enhance biodiversity. The large production areas of maize have great potential for ecological improvements in agriculture.

Utilisation of ley legumes as livestock feed in Zimbabwe	TROPICAL GRASSLANDS			English	Article							"LONG-SEASON VARIETY; MIXED-CROP SILAGES; NUTRITIONAL IMPROVEMENT; INTERCROPPED LEGUMES; MAIZE SILAGE; YIELD; SOLE"	Rural communities in Zimbabwe rely heavily on integration between crop and livestock activities at farm level. This form of agriculture is under increasing pressure because of land degradation, recurrent droughts and increasing human population. Technologies aimed at achieving a balance, whereby crop and livestock can increase in productivity, while resource degradation is minimised, must be developed. Cultivation of ley legumes has the potential to improve the sustainability and productivity of the smallholder mixedfarming systems by providing high-quality feed that can boost crop and livestock production. This paper reviews selection, utilisation and adoption of major ley legumes, and highlights research gaps, constraints and opportunities for ley legume research in Zimbabwe.

AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"Zea mays; Brachiaria spp; Nitrogen agronomic efficiency; Intercropping; Nitrous oxide emissions; Nutrient cycling"	"BIOLOGICAL NITRIFICATION INHIBITION; GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; NITROUS-OXIDE EMISSIONS; COVER CROPS; GRAIN-YIELD; EFFICIENCY; SYSTEM; PALISADEGRASS; HUMIDICOLA; PASTURE"	Nitrogen use in agriculture directly impacts food security, global warming, and environmental degradation. Forage grasses intercropped with maize produce feed for animals and or mulch for no-till systems. Forage grasses may exude nitrification inhibitors. It was hypothesized that brachiaria intercropping increases N recycling and maize grain yield and reduces nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soil under maize cropping. A field experiment was set up in December 2016 to test three cropping system (maize monocropped, maize intercropped with Brachiaria brizantha or with B. humidicola) and two N rates (0 or 150 kg ha-1). The grasses were sown with maize, but B. humidicola did not germinate well in the first year. B. brizantha developed slowly during the maize cycle because of shading but expanded after maize was harvested. The experiment was repeated in 2017/2018 when B. humidicola was replanted. N2O and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, maize grain yield and N content were measured during the two seasons. After the first maize harvest, the above- and below-ground biomass, C and N content of B. brizantha grown during fall-winter, and the biological nitrification inhibition potential of B. brizantha were evaluated. Maize yield responded to N fertilization (5.1 vs. 9.8 t ha-1) but not to brachiaria intercropping. B. brizantha recycled approximately 140 kg N ha-1 and left 12 t dry matter ha-1 for the second maize crop. However, the 2017/18 maize yields were not affected by the N recycled by B. brizantha, whereas N2O emissions were higher in the plots with brachiaria, suggesting that part of the recycled N was released too early after desiccation. Brachiarias showed no evidence of causing nitrification inhibition. The strategy of intercropping brachiarias did not increase maize yield, although it added C and recycled N in the system.

This study was conducted to investigate the differences in light capture among different crop rows in wheat/maize strip intercropping systems. The field experiment comprised four planting patterns: monoculture wheat, monoculture maize, six rows of wheat alternated with two rows of maize (162), and twelve rows of wheat alternated with four rows of maize (1124). A geometrical radiation transmission model was modified to estimate instantaneous light capture by different intercropped rows, which was tested with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) measured above and beneath the intercrop canopy. The results demonstrated that the model accurately predicted PAR transmitted through the canopy with mean absolute error, root mean square error (RMSE) and normalized RMSE of 60.2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), 82.6 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 5.2% respectively for 162 and of 65.91 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), 95.3 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 5.7% respectively for 1124. With assistance of the model, we found that border rows in wheat strip intercepted far greater amount of both direct and diffuse PAR than the inner rows, whereas maize border rows showed no advantage in PAR absorption due to its canopy development was constrained by the competition from wheat strip. Canopy structure character showed positive effects on radiation interception in wheat border rows and all maize rows, and plant phenotypic plasticity showed positive effects on wheat border rows but negative effects on maize border rows. The radiation transmission model presented in this work was proved to be a useful tool for calculating spatial and temporal variability of radiation in strip intercropping systems and it can be further served as a base for modeling the plant growth dynamics in strip intercrops.

Common bean intercropped with maize at three planting dates (simultaneously with maize, at emergence and knee height of maize) in two spatial arrangements (alternate and paired arrangements).The experimental design was factotrial randomized complete block design with three replications. Sole maize and common bean were included as a check. Results revealed that the spatial and temporal differentiation significantly affect only the agronomic attributes of common bean in common bean-maize intercropping. At Adet the grain yield of common bean (1.9 t ha(-1)), LER (1.99) and MAI (357) in maize-common bean intercropping was higher when common bean was planted at the same time with maize in paired planting pattern. On the other hand, maximum LER (1.61) and MAI (2.83) at Finoteselam were observed when common bean was intercropped with maize at maize emergence in paired planting pattern. Simultaneous intercropping of common bean with maize gave more stable total land output yield as compared to other intercropping systems but showed high variability as compared to the sole cropping. Thus, it can be concluded that planting common bean simultaneously with maize in paired planting pattern at Adet and planting common bean at maize emergence at Finoteselam in maize-common bean intercropping gave maximum land use efficiency and profitability of the cropping system without reducing the main crop yield (maize).This research also suggested further research on the compatibility of various maize and common bean varieties in different spatial and temporal differentiation.

INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS			English	Article						"Agro-biodiversity; Amaranth; Biogas production; Cropping system; Intercropping; Maize"	"GRAIN AMARANTH; BIOGAS PRODUCTION; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; CROP PRODUCTION; CURRENT STATE; ENERGY CROPS; QUALITY; CLOVER; FORAGE; COMPETITION"	The use of amaranth as a new crop in biogas crop rotations has raised scientific interest Europe-wide over the past decade. However, the results of studies on its overall performance are somewhat contradictory. This study aims to investigate both the performance of amaranth (Amaranthus hypochondriacus L.) as a biogas crop in comparison to maize (Zea mays L) and to test its suitability for intercropping with two different legume species. For this purpose, field trials were conducted in southwest Germany in 2014 and 2015. The two legumes common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) were chosen for intercropping with the main crops amaranth and maize. Each year, aboveground fresh matter yield, dry matter content (DMC), ash content and specific methane yield (SMY) were determined. The average methane yield per hectare (MYH) of all amaranth treatments was 3030.6 +/- 187.3 m(N)(3),1 ha(-1) in 2014 and 2265.6 +/- 243.4 m(N)(3) ha(-1) in 2015, approximately half that of maize each year. In 2015, the low MYHs stemmed from low dry matter yields (DMYs) caused by drought conditions. This effect was much stronger for maize than for amaranth. The average SMY over the two years was much lower for amaranth (266.0 +/- 1.71(N) kg(-1) of volatile solids (VS)) than for maize (330.0 +/- 1.5(N) kg(-1) of VS) due to higher contents of both ash ( > 13% of VS) and lignin ( > 6% of VS). Intercropping with common bean did not significantly affect the DMY and SMY of either main crop in either year. By contrast, the establishment of white clover was successful in both main crops and years. However, white clover also significantly decreased the DMY of both main crops in 2015. Overall, it was shown that amaranth and maize appear equally suitable for legume intercropping, but new amaranth genotypes and optimized cultivation techniques are required to render it a more productive biogas crop.

Intercropping systems reduced the values of yield attributes and grain yield of maize than sole cropping of maize, but significant reduction in cob length, kernels/row, grains/cob and grain yield was recorded only with sesame (Sesamum indicum L.), turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) and forage meth [Phaseolus aconitifolius (Jacq) Marechal] intercropping systems. All intercropping systems recorded significantly higher maize-equivalent yield, productivity (kg/ha/day) and significant reduction in weed population and weed dry-biomass than sole cropping of maize. Among the intercropping systems, maize + turmeric showed significantly higher maize-equivalent yield and productivity (kg/ha/day), however significantly lower values of these were associated with maize + sesame. Maize + forage meth recorded the lowest weed population, weed dry-biomass and highest weed-control efficiency. Highest weed population, weed dry biomass and lowest weed-control efficiency were found with maize + pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] intercropping system.

The study results in a classification of cropping systems according to factors limiting the fertiliser response of the intercrop species ( mainly bean root necrosis and high soil K supply) and in fertilisation rules specifically adapted to the diversity of agronomic conditions. Bean root necrosis due to a parasitic complex with Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli decreased the fertiliser efficiency and was higher wherever the topography of a field was concave and where beans were frequent in the rotation. High soil exchangeable K content was generally found where the preceding crop was cabbage, a cash crop that is given large amounts of N-P-K fertiliser. Additional fertiliser applied to the BMI decreased nodulation of the bean, N and Mg uptake and bean yield. Because of the competition from the associated bean crop, the maize did not respond to fertiliser.

After clearing different subplots of the fallowed plots in 1993 and 1995, intercropping of cassava + maize was practiced with level (minimum) and mound tillage. Nitrogen fertilizer, between 0 and 60 kg ha(-1), was also applied to subplots of natural regrowth where planted fallows did not survive. Although a maize grain yield of 2.3 t ha(-1) and a cassava root yield of 18.3 t ha(-1) were obtained with level tillage in 1995, grain yield was increased to 2.6 t ha(-1) and cassava yields to about 22 t ha(-1) by mounding and 60 kg N ha(-1) application. Effects of mounding and N application were pronounced in the second and third consecutive years of cropping. Planted tree fallows like S. siamea, A. leptocarpa and L. leucocephala were highly suitable for soil rehabilitation. For sustainable crop production in the second consecutive year of cropping after a 6-year fallow period, mound tillage was recommended while in the third year, mound tillage with 60 kg N ha(-1) was recommended.

A two-year (2012 and 2013) field experiment was conducted to determine the interactive behavior between intercrops in a maize-soybean relay strip intercropping system. Maize plants were planted in different narrow-wide row planting patterns, whereas soybean was planted in wide rows. The total biomass and grain yield of maize increased with increasing maize narrow-row spacing, but the opposite trend was observed for soybean. The aggressivity, competitive ratio, and partial relative crowding advantage values for maize were greater than those for soybean. Moreover, the competitive interaction of the intercrops was affected by the distance between maize and soybean rows. The highest intercrop land equivalent ratio (LER) 1.61 and 1.59 was found in the 40: 160 planting pattern (i.e. 40 cm narrow-row spacing and 160 cm wide-row spacing of maize) during 2012 and 2013, respectively. Combined with actual yield loss and LER, the intense intra-specific competition of maize plants reduced the depression for the associated soybeans when the maize narrow-row spacing was less than 30 cm. When the narrow-row spacing was wider than 50 cm, soybean growth was seriously depressed by maize because of the stronger inter-specific competition between maize and soybean. The maximum yield and economic advantage appeared in the 40: 160 narrow-wide row planting pattern. Therefore, intercropping advantage may be achieved by changing the row spacing and distance between intercrop rows to coordinate the inter-specific competition between maize and soybean.

In 1993, a long-term experiment on sustainable crop rotation and ley farming systems was initiated on a Colombian acid-savanna oxisol to test the effects of grain legumes, green manures, intercrops and leys as possible components that could increase the stability of systems involving annual cereal crops. Five agropastoral treatments (maize monoculture-MMO, maize-soybean rotation-MRT, maize-soybean green manure rotation-MGM, native savanna control-NSC and maize-agropastoral rotation-MAP) under two tillage systems (no till-NT and minimum tillage-MT) were investigated. The effects of NT and MT on SOM and P fractions as well as maize grain yield under the five agropastoral treatments were evaluated. Results showed that soil total C, N and P were generally better under no-till as compared to minimum-tilled soils. While P fractions were also generally higher under no-till treatments, SOM fractions did not show any specific trend. Seven years after establishment of the long-term ley farming experiment (5 years of conventional tillage followed by 2 years alternative tillage systems), MT resulted into moderately higher maize grain yields as compared to NT. The MGM rotation treatment had significantly higher values of maize yield under both tillage systems (4.2 Mg) compared to the NSC (2.3 Mg ha(-1)). Results from this study indicate that the rotational systems (maize-soybean green manure and maize-pastures) improved the soil conditions to implement the no-till or minimum tillage systems on Colombian savanna oxisol.

However, accurate assessment of crop yield and its spatial variation is challenging in SSA because of small field sizes, widespread intercropping practices, and inadequate field observations. This study aimed to firstly evaluate the potential of satellite data in estimating maize yield in intercropped smallholder fields and secondly assess how factors such as satellite data spatial and temporal resolution, within-field variability, field size, harvest index and intercropping practices affect model performance. Having collected in situ data (field size, yield, intercrops occurrence, harvest index, and leaf area index), statistical models were developed to predict yield from multisource satellite data (i.e., Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope). Model accuracy and residuals were assessed against the above factors. Among 150 investigated fields, our study found that nearly half were intercropped with legumes, with an average plot size of 0.17 ha. Despite mixed pixels resulting from intercrops, the model based on the Sentinel-2 red-edge vegetation index (VI) could estimate maize yield with moderate accuracy (R-2 = 0.51, nRMSE = 19.95%), while higher spatial resolution satellite data (e.g., PlanetScope 3 m) only showed a marginal improvement in performance (R-2 = 0.52, nRMSE = 19.95%). Seasonal peak VI values provided better accuracy than seasonal mean/median VI, suggesting peak VI values may capture the signal of the dominant upper maize foliage layer and may be less impacted by understory intercrop effects. Still, intercropping practice reduces model accuracy, as the model residuals are lower in fields with pure maize (1 t/ha) compared to intercropped fields (1.3 t/ha). This study provides a reference for operational maize yield estimation in intercropped smallholder fields, using free satellite data in Southern Malawi.

Conservation Agriculture Practices in Rainfed Uplands of India Improve Maize-Based System Productivity and Profitability	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						"rainfed uplands; system productivity; maize equivalent yield; dominance analysis"	"INTERCROPPING SYSTEMS; SOIL; DENSITY; YIELD; TILLAGE; AFRICA; WHEAT"	Traditional agriculture in rainfed uplands of India has been experiencing low agricultural productivity as the lands suffer from poor soil fertility, susceptibility to water erosion and other external pressures of development and climate change. A shift towards more sustainable cropping systems such as conservation agriculture production systems (CAPS) may help in maintaining soil quality as well as improving crop production and farmers net economic benefit. This research assessed the effects over three years (2011-2014) of reduced tillage, intercropping, and cover cropping practices customized for maize-based production systems in upland areas of Odisha, India. The study focused on crop yield, system productivity and profitability through maize equivalent yield and dominance analysis. Results showed that maize grain yield did not differ significantly over time or among CAPS treatments while cowpea yield was considered as an additional yield in intercropping systems. Mustard and horsegram grown in plots after maize cowpea intercropping recorded higher grain yields of 25 and 37%, respectively, as compared to those without intercropping. Overall, the full CAPS implementation i.e. minimum tillage, maize-cowpea intercropping and mustard residue retention had significantly higher system productivity and net benefits than traditional farmer practices, i.e. conventional tillage, sole maize cropping, and no mustard residue retention. The dominance analysis demonstrated increasing benefits of combining conservation practices that exceeded thresholds for farmer adoption. Given the use of familiar crops and technologies and the magnitude of yield and income improvements, these types of CAPS should be acceptable and attractive for smallholder farmers in the area. This in turn should support a move toward sustainable intensification of crop production to meet future household income and nutritional needs.

Quantifying the crop phenological changes caused by climate change and anthropogenic-management practices can help formulate effective climate change adaptation strategies. In this study, the effects of climate change and anthropogenicmanagement practices on maize phenology (spring, summer, and intercropping maize) in China were distinguished based on historical meteorological and phenological data (1981-2010) of 114 stations using the firstorder difference regression method. Our results show: (1) The vegetative growing period of spring and intercropping maize was extended, whereas that of summer maize was shortened. The reproductive growing periods of spring, summer, and intercropping maize were extended. (2) Isolated impacts of climate change shortened the vegetative growing period of spring maize, summer maize, and intercropping maize by 0.19, 1.06, and 3.12 d decade 1, respectively, while the reproductive growing period was extended by 0.19, 0.74, and 3.47 d decade 1, respectively. (3) The contribution of temperature to maize phenology was greater in the northwest inland maize zone and north spring maize zone than in other regions, whereas the contribution of sunshine hours was higher in Huang-Huai Plain intercropping maize zone and the southwest mountain hills maize zone. (4) The effects of anthropogenic-management practices on maize phenological stages such as sowing, emergence, and maturity were generally greater than that of climate change, which has delayed the phenological stages of summer and intercropping maize and extended the growing period of spring maize. The focus should be paid to the emergence, jointing, and milky stages to increase the water use efficiency in the northwest inland maize zone. The findings provide a scientific basis for improving the adaptability of agricultural systems in climate change.

Effect of Drought Stress on Yield and Quality of Maize/Sunflower and Maize/Sorghum Intercrops for Biogas Production	JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE			English	Article						"biogas; drought stress; energy crops; intercropping; nutrient composition; specific methane yield"	"PEARL-MILLET; ENERGY-PRODUCTION; MAIZE; FORAGE; WATER; SORGHUM; SUNFLOWER; ENVIRONMENT; COMPETITION; IRRIGATION"	Intercropping represents an alternative to maize (Zea mays L.) monoculture to provide substrate for agricultural biogas production. Maize was intercropped with either sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) or forage sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] to determine the effect of seasonal water supply on yield and quality of the above-ground biomass as a fermentation substrate. The two intercrop partners were grown in alternating double rows at plant available soil water levels of 60-80 %, 40-50 % and 15-30 % under a foil tunnel during the years 2006 and 2007 at Braunschweig, Germany. Although the intercrop dry matter yields in each year increased with increasing soil moisture, the partner crops responded quite differently. While maize produced significantly greater biomass under high rather than low water supply in each year, forage sorghum exhibited a significant yield response only in 2006, and sunflower in none of the 2 years. Despite greatly different soil moisture contents, the contribution of sorghum to the intercrop dry matter yield was similar, averaging 43 % in 2006 and 40 % in 2007. Under conditions of moderate and no drought stress, sunflower had a dry matter yield proportion of roughly one-third in both years. In the severe drought treatment, however, sunflower contributed 37 % in 2006 and 54 % in 2007 to the total intercrop dry matter yield. The comparatively good performance of sunflower under conditions of low water supply is attributable to a fast early growth, which allows this crop to exploit the residual winter soil moisture. While the calculated methane-producing potential of the maize/sorghum intercrop was not affected by the level of water supply, the maize/sunflower intercrop in 2006 had a higher theoretically attainable specific methane yield under low and medium than under high water supply. Nevertheless, the effect of water regime on substrate composition within the intercrops was small in comparison with the large differences between the intercrops.

(MCM) on no-tilled and handhoe-tilled plots were studied in an Alfisol in southwestern Nigeria. Runoff and erosion in no-tilled plots were negligible and were not affected by cropping system. Similarly, soil compaction and infiltration which were lower and higher, respectively, in no-tilled plots than in tilled plots were also unaffected by cropping system. With tillage, however, MCM resulted in lower penetrometer resistance in die soil surface and erosion than MC, although water infiltration was unaffected. Maximum diurnal soil temperatures were lower with MCM, with lowest values being observed when combined with no-tillage. Similarly, soil fertility was greater with MCM, with highest fertility occurring in no-tilled plots. Combination of no-tillage with MCM resulted, therefore, in a soil environment which was least compacted, most fertile, cooler, had higher water infiltration rates and where water runoff and soil erosion rates were negligible. Inclusion of melon in the crop mixture did not affect grain yield of maize, but reduced cassava tuber yield. Reduction in tuber yield was of the order of 19%.

In this area, which features a low amount of land per capita, more attention has been focused on producing biomass than on using agro-residues. As a result, diverse methods of maize cropping have been developed, including the maize intercropping system. This study analyzed the nitrogen uptake, biomass yield and quality of spring- and summer-sown maize grown using the intercropping system as opposed to sole cropping or double-cropping during the period 2008-2009 at two nitrogen levels of 150 kg ha(-1) and 300 kg ha-1. The annual biomass, nitrogen uptake, gross energy and biomass composition (including protein, lipids, fiber, ash and nitrogen-free extract) of both spring- and summer-sown maize produced using intercropping were higher than those under sole cropping or even double-cropping. The land equivalent ratios for biomass, gross energy, and biomass composition varied from 1.39 to 1.98. Interspecific facilitation under intercropping was mainly possible because nitrogen utilization occurred at different times for the spring and summer crops and because of the increase in the nitrogen supply, which lessened the competition between them. The weather conditions during the growth stage affected the biomass and bioenergy yield of the intercrops. Regardless of the weather conditions, the advantages of intercropping relative to sole cropping were significant. The results indicate that intercropping of spring- and summer-sown maize can help farmers to produce more biomass and bioenergy in the North China Plain. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Increasing crop yields could be achieved by intensive systems, but these usually need higher energy and emit more carbon (C). Here, we studied crop productivity, energy yields, and C emissions of intercropping versus sole cropping. We tested maize-wheat, maize-rape, maize-pea, and soybean-wheat intercropping, and sole crops as controls in field experiments at Wuwei experimental station in from 2009 to 2011 in a randomized block design with three replicates. We used an evaluation index integrating yield and environmental factors. Results showed a yield increase of 27 % for maize-wheat, 41 % for maize-rape, and 42 % for maize-pea versus sole crops. Water use efficiency increased by 25 % for maize-wheat intercropping over sole wheat, 152 % for maize-rape over sole rape, and 95 % for maize-pea over sole pea. The three maize-crop intercrops produced 68, 308, and 256 % more energy yield than did the sole wheat, sole rape, and sole pea crops, respectively. They emitted 42, 52, and 45 % less C per unit of water in 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively, compared with the sole maize crop. The maize-based intercropping received a the highest evaluation index (0.82 out of 1.0) among the systems evaluated, clearly showing that the maize-based intercropping is the most effective and sustainable cropping system for arid irrigation areas.

Maize sole crop (MSC) nutrient response has been much studied but data is scarce for determination of intercrop functions. A procedure for adapting MSC functions for the maize-bean intercrop was developed. Maize sole crop and intercrop responses were near parallel with notable exceptions for P in high potential areas for maize and for K. Mean intercrop bean yield with no nutrient application was about 0.4 Mg ha(-1) and increased on average by 24, 11 and -3% with N, P and K application, respectively. Response function coefficients for MSC adjusted with the ratio of bean to maize grain value as the dependent variable accounted for nearly all variation in intercrop response coefficients providing the basis for determining intercrop response functions from MSC functions. Maize grain yield equivalent was less with MSC compared with intercrop; exceptions were for response to N in high potential areas and for bean to maize value ratios of two or less. The economically optimal rate of N and P were on average about 15% more but less for K with intercrop compared with MSC but with inconsistency. The economically optimal rate ranged widely with variation in the cost of nutrient use relative to grain value but generally without great effect on yield; an exception was a great effect on MSC yield response to N for high potential areas. Intercrop nutrient response functions can be reliably determined once maize sole crop functions are determined for a recommendation domain."

The N-15 isotope dilution method was used to quantify BNF by three pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L. Millspp.) varieties intercropped with maize (Zea mays L.). The N and P accumulation in plant components of sole maize and intercrops of maize-pigeonpea systems were used to estimate the mean exports and imports of N and P. The proportion of N derived from air (%Ndfa) by the pigeonpea varieties ranged from 93.8% to 99.9% in Malawi and 65.6% to 99.3% in Tanzania. The amount of fixed N (BNF; kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) varied from 37.5 to 117.2 in Malawi and 6.3 to 71.5 in Tanzania. The mean values for BNF during the two cropping seasons were 64.3 for Nyambi, 85.3 for Ntonda, 34.1 for Gairo and -54.3 for Babati sites. The mean N budget (kg ha(-1)) was -26.1 in the sole maize plots and -40.3 for the intercrops at the two locations in Malawi, and -50.1 in the sole crop plots and -51.1 in the intercrops at the locations in Tanzania. In a scenario where all the aboveground material except the edible parts was returned to the soil, a positive value of 30.5 kg N for the intercrops was recorded compared with -8.9 kg N for the sole maize in Malawi. For the same scenario in Tanzania, the budget was more negative (-35.4 kg N) for sole maize compared with intercrops (-5.9 kg N). Including the roots in the calculations, did not change the differences between mono and intercrops. The P budget was negative irrespective of whether the aboveground biomass of maize and pigeonpea was incorporated or exported out of the fields, and the values were similar for intercrops and sole maize. The most negative N and P budgets were recorded in the two study areas where the extractable soil P status of the soils and the maize yields were high. These findings indicate that pigeonpea incorporated into maize-based cropping systems will maintain a very high %Ndfa ( > 90%) in all plant parts and thereby contribute to improved N budgets but not increase the proportion of P mined of the soil."

Agricultural practices and their potential role in mycotoxin contamination of maize and groundnut subsistence farming	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE			English	Article						"mycotoxigenic fungi; storage; mycotoxins; survey; South Africa"	"STORED-MAIZE; CONVENTIONAL TILLAGE; AGRONOMIC PRACTICES; FORMER TRANSKEI; AFLATOXIN B-1; FUMONISIN B-1; FUSARIUM SPP.; METAL SILOS; NO-TILL; EXPOSURE"	"Mycotoxigenic fungi are common pathogens of maize and groundnuts; they produce mycotoxins which reduce the yield and quality of these grain crops. Numerous agricultural practices including crop rotation and storage methods have been shown to impact mycotoxin accumulation. Therefore, the farming and storage practices in maize and groundnut subsistence farming systems in Pongola, Vryheid, Jozini, Manguzi and Mbazwana Districts of northern KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa) were surveyed to determine their potential role in promoting or mitigating mycotoxin contamination. A questionnaire about agricultural farming practices and storage facilities was presented to 65 subsistence maize and/or groundnut farmers. At least 90% of the farmers surveyed were not aware of mycotoxins and their consequences to animal and human health. The majority of the farmers did not practise crop rotation. However, they practised intercropping and sorted damaged and mouldy grain (maize and groundnuts) before storage. The damaged or mouldy grain was largely used as animal feed, thereby exposing animals to an increased risk of mycotoxicoses. Metal tanks and ingolobane (a type of wooden structure) were identified as the most common storage structures. Harvested homegrown maize was mostly used for the farmers' own consumption but also sometimes sold to the local community. The implementation of mycotoxin awareness campaigns is necessary, particularly in these districts. The storage facilities used by the subsistence farmers allowed increased moisture and insect invasion. The need for the surveillance of mycotoxins in subsistence-farmed food crops in vital. Significance: The main finding of this study is the extent of post-harvest losses and mycotoxin contamination of maize produced by smallholder farmers in South Africa. We further identify methods to manage the risk of mycotoxin exposure to smallholder farmers and their communities as well as reduce post-harvest losses."

In this study, two maize-soybean intercropping systems (maize with and without film mulching) were compared with maize and soybean sole crops in rainfed farmland on the Loess Plateau. Different features, including the maize root morphological traits, root vertical distribution, shoot traits, interspecific root overlap, and grain yield of intercrops, were determined after silking in 2017 (dry year) and 2018 (wet year). The intercropped maize (without film mulching) employed a thin root system under dry conditions and a profuse root system under wet conditions, with shallow roots and active root-diameter strategy to adapt to varied water conditions. These features resulted in higher grain yield in per unit area for the intercropped maize (16.97 % overyielding) than sole maize without film mulching. Film mulching of intercropped maize modified the roots with confined growth under dry conditions and inhibited the roots with excessive growth under wet conditions; as a consequence, the two morphologies of intercropped maize root system were reshaped into the optimal one (less profuse but not thin), with S-type vertical distribution (1 m soil profile) for root length and more beneficial root-diameter strategy. Besides, film mulching improved interspecific root interaction through an evident increase in root length or mass in the interspecific overlap regions. Finally, film mulching improved the maize overyielding dramatically (84 %) due to high leaf adaptability and efficient root-shoot synergy in maize plants. Importantly, the maize mulching did not decrease intercropped soybean yield significantly when compared with sole soybean due to the benefits from interspecific facilitation, while it enhanced total grain yield (10.67 %) for the inter cropping system. Thus, film mulching improved maize root morphology and balanced soil resource exploitation and shoot development, consequently strengthening the attainable grain yield in the intercropping system. To conclude, the research elucidates the plant root mechanisms (root morphological changes) underlying over yielding of intercropped maize in varied water conditions. It identifies film mulching of maize as a strategy to optimize root growth and function for higher intercropping yield advantage in dryland."

Maize is the taller crop, and due to its dominance in light capture over soybean in the intercrop, maize is expected to outperform maize in sole cropping. Conversely, soybean is the subordinate crop and intercropped soybean plants are expected to perform worse than sole soybean. Crop plants show plastic responses in plant architecture to their growing conditions to forage for light and avoid shading. There is little knowledge on plant architectural responses to growing conditions in simultaneous (non-relay) intercropping and their relationship to species yields. A two-year field experiment with two simultaneous maize/soybean intercropping systems with narrow and wide strips was conducted to characterise architectural traits of maize and soybean plants grown as intercrop and sole crops. Intercropped maize plants, especially those in border rows, had substantially greater leaf area, biomass and yield than maize plants in sole crops. Intercropped soybean plants, especially those in border rows, had lower leaf area, biomass and yield than sole soybean plants. Overall intercrop performance was similar to that of sole crops, with the land equivalent ratio (LER) being only slightly greater than one (1.03-1.08). Soybean displayed typical shade avoidance responses in the intercrop, such as greater internode elongation and changes in specific leaf area, but these responses could not overcome the consequences of the competition with the taller maize plants. Therefore, in contrast to relay intercrop systems, in the studied simultaneous maize/soybean system, plastic responses did not contribute to practically relevant increases in resource capture and yield at whole system (i.e., intercrop) level.

This indicates that soil fungal communities are investigated less intensively than bacteria. Therefore, the main goal of this paper was to evaluate the fungal mycobiome structure in monoculture soils in a culture-independent approach. Firstly, the study was conducted to identify the core mycobiome composition and its variability at different stages of the maize growing season (spring, summer, and autumn). Secondly, we identified and recommended fungal indicators of both sensitivity and resistance to long-term maize monoculture. Two neighboring fields from the Potulicka Foundation area were selected for the study: K20 sown with a Gorzow mixture (intercropping mixture) to improve soil quality after a maize monoculture in 2020 and K21, where long-term (over 30 years) monoculture cultivation was continued. The basic chemical features [acidity, redox potential, total organic carbon (TOC), and moisture] of soils were determined, fungal genetic diversity was assessed by ITS next generation sequencing (NGS) analyses, and biodiversity indices were calculated. The results of the NGS technique facilitated recognition and classification of the fungal mycobiome to the taxonomic genus level and changes in the fungal structure in the three periods (spring, summer, and autumn) were assessed. It was evidenced that the mycobiome composition was dependent on both the seasons and the agricultural practices. It was also found that even a 1-year break in the monoculture in favor of an intercropping mixture improved soil properties thus contributing to higher biodiversity. Mortierella was recommended as a potential indicator of sensitivity to long-term maize cultivation, whereas Solicoccozyma and Exophiala were proposed as indicators of resistance to long-term maize cultivation. We proved that the precision farming principles applied on the Potulicka Foundation farm had a very positive effect on fungal biodiversity, which was high even in the long-term maize monoculture field. Therefore, the monoculture cultivation carried out in this way does not induce biological degradation of monoculture soils but preserves their good biological quality.
