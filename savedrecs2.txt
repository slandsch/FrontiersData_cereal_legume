Effect of intercropping cucumber Cucumis sativus (Cucurbitaceae) at different times with maize Zea mays (Poaceae) on the density of cucumber insect pests	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE			English	Article						"cucumber; maize; time of intercropping; Dacus spp.; Bactrocera spp.; Epilachna spp.; Podagrica spp."	"TOMATO LYCOPERSICON-ESCULENTUM; COWPEA VIGNA-UNGUICULATA; DAMAGE; INFESTATION; POD; MANAGEMENT"	The effectiveness of maize (Zea mays L.) planted at different times in a maize-cucumber intercrop to reduce the density of cucumber insect pests was investigated in 2007 and 2008. The cucumber varieties Marketmore and Hybrid F1 were established from seed as a monocrop or intercropped with maize, and with maize established 2 weeks before cucumber (2WBC), the same day with cucumber (SDC) or 2 weeks after cucumber (2WAC). Irrespective of the cucumber variety, there was a significant reduction (over 50%) in the density of insect pests in the cucumber-maize intercrop compared with cucumber alone. Similarly, in both years, fruit damage was significantly lower (about 50%) in the intercropped cucumber, particularly at 2WBC and SDC, compared with cucumber alone. Cucumber fruit yield was significantly higher at SDC but significantly lower at 2WBC relative to the other times. In both years, a relatively higher yield for cucumber was obtained at SDC than at 2WBC and 2WAC. Therefore, a significant control of cucumber insect pests and a higher cucumber yield were obtained when cucumber and maize were planted on the same day.	"[Pitan, O. O. R.; Filani, C.

Intercropped with Climbing Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)	AGRICULTURE-BASEL			English	Article						"maize; Zea mays; climbing bean; Phaseolus vulgaris; intercropping; stand density; nitrogen fertilization; crude protein"	"METHANE YIELD; COMMON; QUALITY"	Maize is Germany's most important fodder and energy crop. However, pure maize cultivation has ecological disadvantages. Moreover, its yield is low in crude protein, an important feed quality parameter. Maize bean intercropping can potentially address both issues. A bean variety specially developed for intercropping was first introduced in 2016. Using this variety, a network of institutions conducted 13 field trials from 2017 to 2020 on four sites in Germany. We sought to determine the effects of stand density and nitrogen (N) fertilization on dry matter yield, crude protein yield, and soil mineral N content (N-min) at harvest of intercropped vs. pure maize. The three intercropping bean densities we tested (7.5, 5.5, and 4 plants/m(2)) produced non-significantly different yields of dry matter or crude protein, given a maize density of 7.5-8 plants/m(2). Intercropping was inferior to pure maize in dry matter yield, but non-significantly different in crude protein yield. Under neither cropping strategy were significant losses in dry matter or crude protein yield recorded with reduced compared to full N fertilization. At full fertilization, however, both pure maize systems and the 8/4 maize-bean intercrop system left significantly higher N-min at harvest than the other variants of the corresponding system or N fertilization level and thus an increased risk of nitrate leaching. We encourage further optimization of yield performance in maize-bean intercropping, e.g., through breeding or promotion of biological N fixation via rhizobia inoculation. Furthermore, we recommend reducing N fertilization levels in maize cultivation.

The highest maize-equivalent yield (60.64 q/ha) was obtained with maize + groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.)-mustard [Brassica juncea (L.) Czernj. & Cosson] crop sequence with highest net returns (Rs 1,6476/ha) and benefit : cost ratio (2.19). Intercropping legumes with cereals was found to be highly productive and profitable inclusion of groundnut as an intercrop with rice and maize not only enhanced crop yields and highest net returns but also had positive effect on soil fertility build up. Sole cropping of maize-mustard was found to be very exhaustive and unremunerative, while inclusion of groundnut as an intercrop was highly stable and profitable.

Small landholders who grow sweet maize for the fresh produce market often also have cattle with little access to winter forage. Grazing cover crops with the stover can potentially increase the available nutritive value. Intercropping the cereal rye or hairy vetch into sweet maize approximately 65 days after planting (V7-9 sweet maize maturity) did not influence sweet maize stover biomass yield or nutritive value after winter. However, the crude protein concentration of hairy vetch was greater than rye, but digestibility was not different. Average daily gains by yearling cattle were similar when grazing maize-rye or maize-vetch. Producers with limited land resources should consider the timing of the spring planting of the primary crop, in this case, sweet maize, in relation to the initiation of grazing of winter cover crops to maximize utilization of the previous crop's residue (stover) as well as the cover crop itself before the primary crop planting time. Small landholders who grow sweet maize for the fresh produce market often also have cattle with little access to winter forage. Grazing cover crops with sweet maize stover can potentially increase the available nutritive value. A 3-year randomized complete block study with three replicates at New Mexico State University's Alcalde Sustainable Agriculture Science Center compared sweet maize (Zea mays var. rugosa) with sweet maize relay intercropped at the V7-9 stage with cereal rye (rye: Secale cereale L.) or hairy vetch (vetch: Vicia villosa Roth) for early spring grazing. Intercropping the rye or hairy vetch into sweet maize did not influence the sweet maize stover biomass yield or nutritive value after the winter. The dry matter (DM) yield and crude protein (CP) concentration of hairy vetch biomass was greater (p < 0.01) than rye biomass (1.46 vs. 2.94 Mg DM ha(-1) for rye and hairy vetch, respectively, and 145 vs. 193 g CP kg(-1) for rye and hairy vetch, respectively). Average daily gains by yearling cattle were not different when grazing maize-rye or maize-vetch. Producers should consider the spring planting timing of the primary crop and the initiation of grazing in the winter or the spring to maximize the utilization of the previous crop's residue (stover), as well as the cover crop itself.

Legume mixtures with grasses can result in slower nutrient release from residues, better matching the N requirements of the following crop. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of the green manures sunnhemp (Crotalaria juncea) and millet (Pennisetum glaucum), alone or mixed, on the performance of a subsequent maize crop with and without the application of N-fertilizer. The experiment consisted of four randomized blocks, with split plots. The plot treatments consisted of previous cultivation of sunnhemp, millet, mixed sunnhemp+millet and weeds. The subplot treatments were 90 kg N ha(-1) and absence of N-fertilizer. Substantial amounts of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) nitrogen were present in above ground parts of sunnhemp alone (173 kg ha(-1)) and mixed with millet (89 kg ha(-1)). Decay rates showed that half of the N was released 15 and 22 days from sunnhemp and sunnhemp+millet residues, respectively. The difference was attributed to temporary immobilization due to the higher C/N ratio of sunnhemp+millet. The preceding sunnhemp+millet treatment resulted in a larger maize yield than sunnhemp alone, when no N-fertilizer was applied. This effect was not observed when N-fertilizer was added. This effect may be due to a more timely N release, compared to sunnhemp and millet alone, when available N is required for maize. Nitrogen budgets showed that 15% and 10% in maize grain N was recovered from BNF for sunnhemp alone and sunnhemp+millet respectively. The recovery of N-BNF by maize was 65% higher after sunnhemp+millet than after sunnhemp monocrop.

However, considering economic benefits of intercropping mountain agriculture is deficient. A field experiment was conducted to determine productivity, economic efficiency, and soil conservation benefits of intercropping of maize (Zea mays L.) with chili (Capsicum annuum L.) and setaria grass (Setaria anceps Stapf ex Massesy) in Yunnan. Runoff, sediment, crop yield, and economic benefits were evaluated under sole maize (SM), sole chili (SC), maize/chili intercropping (MCI), and maize/setaria grass intercropping (MGI). The results suggested that intercropping decreased runoff when compared with sole crop. The MGI had the least sediment, followed by MCI, SM, and SC. Severe soil loss was observed in sole crop systems but not in intercropping systems. Moreover, the land equivalent ratio (LER) of MCI ranged from 1.22 to 1.69, and mean economic income (US$3955 ha(-1)) were 29.91, 16.38, and 23.41% higher than that of SM, SC, and MGI, respectively. Therefore, MCI can integrate the benefits of productivity, economy, and soil conservation, suggesting that intercropping of maize and chili, a staple-cash crop pattern, should be favored in mountain agriculture.

This study determined land equivalent ratio (LER) and water use efficiency (WUE) of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/maize (Zea mays L.) intercropping and quantified the magnitude of yield increases due to belowground interspecies interactions. Field experiments, conducted at Wuwei (37 degrees 96'N, 102 degrees 64'E) in 2008 to 2010, included sole wheat (W), sole maize (M), wheat/maize intercropping with no root-barrier (W/M), with a plastic sheet barrier (PW/M), or with a nylon mesh barrier (NW/M), vertically placed to one meter deep between the intercrops. Wheat/maize intercropping increased grain yields by 46% in 2008, 26% in 2009, and 64% in 2010, and improved WUE by 49, 30, and 20% in the respective years, compared with the corresponding sole cropping. The LER values ranged from 1.24 to 1.60 for W/M, suggesting that the grain yield of intercropping per hectare is equivalent to the yield that sole wheat or sole maize would produce on 1.24 and 1.60 ha. The W/M system had total yield of 10.6, 11.1, and 16.9 t ha(-1) in 2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively; they were 20, 14, and 15% greater compared with the PW/M system; belowground interspecies interactions contributed 32% of the increased yield in 2008, 29% in 2009, and 40% in 2010.

Intercropping maize with grain legumes influences weed suppression, soil temperature, and disease incidence in Swaziland	TROPICAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article						"intercropping; maize; legumes; weed suppression; soil temperature"		Intercropping is a common cropping system among small-scale farmers in the tropics. It involves the growing of two or more unrelated crop species on the same land, in the same farming season. Many Swaziland farmers do not practise it, not knowing which crop combinations would give the best benefits. An investigation that would fill this gap in local knowledge would give farmers a guideline. In this field experiment, conducted in Luyengo, Swaziland, maize (Zea mays L.) was grown as a monocrop and in association with sugar bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) to determine the extent of crop association to give increased weed suppression, soil temperature, and disease incidence of the cropping systems. Results showed significant differences (P < 0.05) between the levels of weed suppression of the cropping systems, the intercrops giving greater weed suppression than the monocrops.	"[Ossom, E.

As Crotalaria spp. are antagonistic to Meloidogyne, and S. sesban and T. vogelii suppress Pratylenchus, a field study was conducted on farms in western Kenya to test whether mixing S, sesban or T. vogelii with C. grahamiana can resolve the nematode problems associated with pure crops of the respective species. The pure and two-species mixed cover crops, grown for 10 or 12 months, were evaluated against natural and bare fallows. Maize (Zen mays) and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) were then intercropped and the plots split to determine the effects of incorporating the biomass of natural fallows/cover crops against its removal on nematode infection of crops, ir: vogelii and S. sesban were highly infected by Meloidogyne and their pure crops supported increased populations of this nematode. In mixed systems, C. grahamiana did not affect Meloidogyne infection of S. sesban and T. vogelii, but it significantly reduced the soil nematode populations compared with the respective pure crops. Root-lesion (Pratylenchus zeae, P. thornei and P. pseudopratensis) and spiral nematodes (Helicotylenchus pseudorobustus and Scutellonema brachyurus) were greatest in number following pure C. grahamiana. Mixing C. grahamiana with either S. sesban or T. vogelii did not restrict these nematode populations. Meloidogyne infection of bean following S. sesban + C. grahamiana and T, vogelii + C. grahamiana was restricted and the crop after these mixed systems did not lose yield compared with that after pure S. sesban and T. vogelii. All cover crops, except pure C. grahamiana and its mixture with S. sesban at Yala, increased maize yields compared with natural and bare fallows. In situ decomposition of the foliar biomass of cover crops and natural fallow did not affect nematode infection of both the annual crops.

"LENGTH DENSITY; SYSTEM; ARCHITECTURE; PRODUCTIVITY; DIVERSITY; YIELD"	Root architecture, which determines the water and nutrient uptake ability of crops, is highly plastic in response to soil environmental changes and different cultivation patterns. Root phenotyping for field-grown crops, especially topological trait extraction, is rarely performed. In this study, an image-based semi-automatic root phenotyping method for field-grown crops was developed. The method consisted of image acquisition, image denoising and segmentation, trait extraction and data analysis. Five global traits and 40 local traits were extracted with this method. A good consistency in 1st-order lateral root branching was observed between the visually counted values and the values extracted using the developed method, with R-2=0.97. Using the method, we found that the interspecific advantages for maize mainly occurred within 5 cm from the root base in the nodal roots of the 5th-7th nodes, and that the obvious inhibition of soybean was mostly reflected within 20 cm from the root base. Our study provides a novel approach with high-throughput and high-accuracy for field research on root morphology and branching features. It could be applied to the 3D reconstruction of field-grown root system architecture to improve the inputs to data-driven models (e.g., OpenSimRoot) that simulate root growth, solute transport and water uptake.

The process of crop growth and surface water and energy transfer will change significantly under the dual control of mulch and drip irrigation compared with those under the traditional border irrigation under mulch (BM) method, which will further affect the regional eco-hydrology process. The Hexi Corridor has become the largest seed maize production base in China due to its abundant solar radiation, and heat resources and large diurnal temperature difference. Unlike grain maize, seed maize can be divided into female and male parent plants. The growth conditions of the parent plants differ; male plants are planted 7-14 d later than female plants to produce preferable fertilization conditions, which distinctly influences the energy transfer process between the different parent plants and the soil and ultimately leads to significantly different plant water consumption in the maize field. To determine the difference in the transpiration rate between a BM field and a DM field and to reveal the difference in water consumption characteristics between female and male plants, eddy covariance system (EC) measurements, a thermal balance sap flow system and micro-lysimeters were applied to conduct continuous, fixed-location comparison measurements of the total evapotranspiration from 2014 to 2016. The total evapotranspiration (ET), transpiration rates of the female (T-f) and male plants (T-m) and the soil evaporation (E-s) in seed maize fields were separately analysed in both the BM field and DM fields. Results indicated that T-f/ET, T-m/ET and E-s/ET dynamically varied with the crop growth during the whole growth period. Transpiration rates under the DM treatment were 2-8% higher than those under the BM treatment under the local agricultural management conditions. Besides, the female plant transpiration rate exceeded the male plant transpiration rate by 9-20% in the BM treatment and by 14-32% in the DM treatment field during the whole growth stages. However, male plant transpiration produced after the pollination of female plants is useless to final seed production. It is more practical to decrease the planting ratio of male to female plants to the appropriate level and remove the male plants earlier to increase the water use efficiency in seed maize fields. Moreover, the seed maize field in this study had a smaller proportion of soil evaporation than those in other grain maize field studies conducted around the world, which was probably due to the mulching effect and higher plant density."

The higher grain yield and land equivalent ratio obtained under alternating rows + biofertiliser treatment demonstrated the improved ability of crops in close proximity for better utilisation of existing agro-ecological conditions. Alternating rows + organic fertiliser decreased the molar ratios phytate : beta-carotene, phytate : Fe, phytate : Mg and phytate : Zn, indicating increased availability of the mineral elements in both crops. However, alternating strips + organic fertiliser contributed mostly to an increase in beta-carotene, Mg, Fe and Zn concentrations in soybean. Increased grain yield of both crops was followed by decrease in beta-carotene and increase in phytate, particularly in maize. In soybean, beta-carotene could be considered as the main contributor to Fe availability. Accordingly, cropping in alternating rows or strips, combined with biofertilisers, could serve as fortification measures for improved nutritional quality of maize and soybean grain, without grain yield losses.

In this system, ovipositing moths are repelled by an intercrop and subsequently attracted to a discard perimeter crop. Studies were conducted at two sites in western Kenya and one site in South Africa. Treatments comprised two fields of maize intercropped with desmodium, and a Napier grass perimeter ('push-pull' system) and two fields of maize monocrop. Treatments were laid out in a completely randomized design at each site. Maize stemborer colonization, oviposition preference and incidence of stemborer larvae and pupae were significantly lower in 'push-pull' plots than maize monocrop plots at all sites. Similarly, the various crop damage levels were for most part significantly higher in maize monocrop than push-pull' plots. Maize yield per plant and per plot were mostly significantly higher in 'push-pull' than maize monocrop plots.

This experiment was carried during two years (2007 and 2008) on Research Center, University of Zabol, Iran, to investigate the influence of cowpea on the microclimate of their intercrop and sole maize (SM) as control. Measurements of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), soil temperature (ST), soil moisture (SM) and crop yield were carried out to study the effects of intercropping on crop yield in a cowpea-maize intercropping system in Sistan at southeast of Iran. We found that intercropping increased the amount of absorption PAR compared to sole crop of maize. The highest amount of PAR was obtained at 100% cowpea + 100% maize with no significant difference to 100% cowpea + 50% maize. The lowest amount of PAR was obtained at 75% maize + 25% cowpea. Intercropping system had significant effects on soil temperature and soil moisture (P<0.01). The highest soil temperature was obtained at sole maize and the lowest temperature was at sole cowpea. Soil moisture was, lowest at sole maize and highest at sole cowpea. LER (land equivalent ratio) values were greater in all intercropping systems with different planting ratios which indicated yield advantage of intercropping over sole cropping of maize. Results indicate that intercropping can increase light interception and increased shading in intercropping system compared to sole maize and reduce water evaporation and improve conservation of soil,moisture. Based on high grain and suitable environmental condition, intercrop productivity compared to sole crop could be selected for improving the productivity of maize/cowpea mixture in the Southeast of Iran.

Intercropping Pattern and N Fertilizer Schedule Affect the Performance of Additively Intercropped Maize and Forage Cowpea in the Mediterranean Region	AGRONOMY-BASEL			English	Article						"intercropping; nitrogen fertilization; maize; forage cowpea; land equivalent ratio; dry matter equivalent ratio"	"ZEA-MAYS L.; VIGNA-UNGUICULATA L.; LAND-USE EFFICIENCY; PLANT-DENSITY; YIELD; NITROGEN; QUALITY; PRODUCTIVITY; PEA; TILLAGE"	Intercropping maize and forage cowpea is a widely proposed strategy to improve land use efficiency, and maximize the economic value of the farming system, especially in developing countries with restricted resources. The current study was carried out during the successive summers of 2020 and 2021 in Northern Egypt. The main objective was to evaluate the effect of three N schedules (NS1, NS2, NS3), when three different maize-cowpea intercropping patterns (IP1, IP2, IP3) were applied, on the grain yield of maize, forage yield and quality of forage cowpea. In addition, yield gain and land use efficiency were evaluated using the land equivalent ratio (LER) and dry matter equivalent ratio (DMER) indices. Results revealed that the intercropping patterns that provided wider spacings for the component crops and reduced the competition between them, mainly IP3, resulted in the best performances for the two crops. This was clear for maize ear and grain yields, 100-grain weight and harvest index, in addition to cowpea fresh and dry forage yields, crude protein and non-fiber carbohydrates of the three cuts. Regarding the applied N schedules, NS1 which included the application of a N starter dose with sowing proved to be the most efficient schedule that led to the best performance for both crops. Maize produced 9.07 t ha(-1) grain yield under IP3 and NS1. In addition, the application of IP3 resulted in the highest significant cowpea dry forage yield (DFY), with the highest crude protein (CP) content. The DFY of cuts 1, 2, and 3 amounted to 1.27, 0.45, and 0.24 t ha(-1), while the CP content for the three respective cuts reached 159.49, 157.96, and 148.91 g kg(-1). Nonetheless, NS1 produced a reasonable amount of DFY with high CP content. It is recommended to follow the third proposed intercropping pattern (IP3) and to include a nitrogen starter dose (NS1) in the fertilization scheme to ensure highest productivity from the intercropped maize and forage cowpea.

A field experiment with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-maize (Zea mays L.) intercropping was conducted to evaluate the interspecific competition with four types of straw management for wheat (no-tillage with straw standing or mulched soil and conventional tillage with straw incorporation or no straw retained) and two methods of plastic mulching for maize (no-tillage with residual plastic mulching [i.e., new at the beginning of the previous crop, old plastic mulched in season] and conventional tillage with annual new plastic mulching). Aboveground biomass of intercrops was sampled throughout the growing season and fit to a logistic growth model. Compared with sole-cropping, intercropping significantly increased maximum biomass and maximum growth rate of wheat but suppressed vegetative and maximum growth rates of maize. Maize growth recovered after wheat was harvested when maize was blister kernel stage (R2). Straw mulching in wheat strips and residual plastic mulching in maize strips produced greater maximum biomass amount or rates of wheat and maize than that with conventional intercropping (conventional tillage with no straw retention in wheat strips and annual new plastic mulching in maize strips). Straw mulching in wheat strips and residual plastic mulching in maize strips enhanced total grain yields by 14.9% compared with conventional intercropping. Straw mulching in wheat strips and residual plastic mulch in maize strips are suitable for coordinating interspecies interactions and increasing the productivity of wheat-maize intercropping.

However, how interspecies interaction intensity reduces water consumption in intercropping is still unclear. The effects of interspecies interaction intensity in wheat (Triticum aestivum)-maize (Zea mays) intercropping system on water consumption characteristics, root length density, and grain yield were examined. A 3-yr field experiment was conducted to evaluate three root interaction intensities: complete belowground interaction (W/M, without root barrier), partial belowground interaction (NW/M, nylon mesh barrier), and without belowground interaction (PW/M, plastic sheet barrier), with two plant densities of maize (45,000 plants ha(-1), M1, and 52,500 plants ha(-1), M2) in wheat-maize intercropping system. During co-growth period of wheat and maize and independent growth of maize, evaporation was reduced by W/M and with increased maize plant density. Root length density of maize was inhibited by intercropped wheat during the co-growth period. Root length density of maize in the W/M treatment was increased by 14% in 2014 and 45% in 2015, compared with the NW/M treatment, and increased by 26% in 2014 and 119% in 2015, compared with the PW/M treatment, expect for 2016, during maize independent growth. Moreover, there was a negative correlation between evaporation and root length density of maize. Grain yield was increased by W/M2 treatment. Increasing interspecies interaction intensity can decrease evaporation by increasing the root length density of intercropping crops.

In the first study a single hybrid was subjected to three water-stress treatments: mild stress, severe stress and well-watered conditions. Leaf appearance and length of individual internodes, sheaths and leaves were measured at frequent intervals. The aim was to describe the underlying growth processes linking plant height with leaf appearance. The study showed that for the upper two-thirds of the nodes on the plants, the duration of elongation of sheaths and internodes was 4.1 and 5.8 phyllochron (defined as the time interval between the appearance of successive leaves), respectively. Water stress had little impact on the duration of elongation. The increase in leaf height (the apparent insertion point of the laminae) attained after full expansion was due to continued elongation of internodes below it. In the second study seven genotypes, ranging in final leaf number from 16 to 20, were measured for leaf appearance, leaf height and plant height. The aim was to develop, across genotypes, relationships to predict leaf height as a function of leaf appearance and final leaf number. Across all genotypes a consistent relationship was found between plant height increase and leaf appearance, with height increasing at a slow initial rate until the appearance of leaf 7, afterwards height increased at 5 times the initial rate until appearance of the flag leaf. A consistent relationship was also found to describe further increase in leaf height after full expansion. This study showed that height of individual leaves in maize can be related throughout growth to leaf appearance and final leaf number. Therefore, vertical distribution of maize leaf area can be predicted in crop growth models relatively easily from leaf appearance, final leaf number and additional information of leaf sizes and angles.

Experiment consisted of eight main treatments and six sub treatments. The main treatments which is the focus of this article were made up of the application of two pre-emergence herbicides [Primextra and Galex, each at 2.5 kg a.i./ha alone or with one or two supplementary hoe weedings at 6 weeks after planting (WAP) or 6 and 12WAP], a hoe-weeded check (hoeing at 3, 6 and 12WAP) and a weedy control. The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design with a criss-cross arrangement, and replicated three times. Data were collected for weed infestation and control, as well as for yield of food crops. When used alone, the pre-emergence herbicides gave satisfactory weed control up to 6WAP, but failed to give season-long weed control. However, better weed control was achieved when the pre-emergence herbicides were supplemented with two hoe-weedings, (P<0.05). Consequently, Primextra plus two hoe weedings (Prim+2HW) gave significantly lower weed biomass (42.9 g/m(2)) and higher yields of the food crops (1135 kg/ha for maize and 10,027 kg/ha for cassava) compared with the hoe-weeded control treatment (63.0 g/m(2), weed biomass; 849 kg/ha, maize and 8076 kg/ha, cassava), plots treated with Primextra alone (80.4 g/m(2), weed biomass; 678 kg/ha, maize; 1801 kg/ha, cassava) and the weedy control (116.3 g/m(2), weed biomass; 358 kg/ha, maize and 1425 kg/ha, cassava)."

In this study, maize and soybean intercropped in different numbers of rows and their monocropping equivalents were tested to determine the best intercropping system in a crop rotation following winter wheat. The treatments were monoculture maize (M), monoculture soybean (S), 75% maize + 25% soybean (3M:1S), 50% maize + 50% soybean (2M:2S) and 25% maize + 75% soybean (1M:3S). The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications in 2011 and 2012 in Antalya, Turkey. Highest fresh forage yields were obtained from maize (53.3 tha(-1)) and 3M:1S (62.8 tha(-1)) treatments in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Maize treatment had highest dry matter yield (21.1 and 22.0 tha(-1)) in both years. Quality analysis of silage revealed that 3M:1S was superior to maize treatment in terms of dry matter (25.23%), crude protein (7.31%), crude fiber (18.27%), neutral detergent fiber (42.56%), acid detergent fiber (25.81%), lactic acid (4.71%) and acetic acid (4.05%). In conclusion, 3M:1S row intercropped production system was a better alternative for silage to monoculture maize in a crop rotation following winter wheat.

However, quantitative and comparative data available as to their N-2 fixation and N beneficial effect on the companion crop in intercropping systems are scarce. Hence, studies were conducted to ascertain the above when cowpea (Vigna unguiculata I,.), mungbean (Vigna radiata L.) and groundnut (Arachis hypagaea L.) were intercropped with maize. The study was N-15-aided and made outdoors in basins (30 L) filled with 38 kg of soil. N-15 labelling was effected by incorporating N-15-tagged plant material or applying N-15-labelled fertilizer along with sucrose to stabilize N-15 enrichment in the soil during the experimental period. Intercropped groundnut fixed the highest amount of nitrogen from the atmosphere (i.e. 552 mg plant(-1)), deriving 85% of its N from the atmosphere. Intercropped cowpea and mungbean fixed 161 and 197 mg N plant(-1), obtaining 81% and 78% of their N content from the atmosphere, respectively. The proportion of N derived by maize from the associated legume varied from 7-11% for mungbean, 11-20% for cowpea and 12-26% for groundnut which amounted to about 19-22, 29-45 and 33-60 mg N maize plant(-1), respectively. The high nitrogen fixation potential of groundnut in dual stands and its relatively low harvest index for N have apparently contributed to greater N-benefical effect on the associated crop.

However, iron deficiency severely reduces peanut growth in calcareous soils. The maize/peanut intercropping effectively improves iron nutrition and N-2 fixation of peanut under pot and field conditions on calcareous soils. However, little was known of how intercropping regulates iron transporters in peanut. We identified AhDMT1 as a Fe2+ transporter which was highly expressed in mature nodules with stronger N-2 fixation capacity. Promoter expression analysis indicated that AhDMT1 was localized in the vascular tissues of both roots and nodules in peanut. Short-term Fe-deficiency temporarily induced an AhDmt1 expression in mature nodules in contrast to roots. However, analysis of the correlation between the complex regulation pattern of AhDmt1 expression and iron nutrition status indicated that sufficient iron supply for long term was a prerequisite for keeping AhDmt1 at a high expression level in both, peanut roots and mature nodules. The AhDmt1 expression in peanut intercropped with maize under 3 years greenhouse experiments was similar to that of peanut supplied with sufficient iron in laboratory experiments. Thus, the positive interspecific effect of intercropping may supply sufficient iron to enhance the expression of AhDmt1 in peanut roots and mature nodules to improve the iron nutrition and N-2 fixation in nodules. This study may also serve as a paradigm in which functionally important genes and their ecological significance in intercropping were characterized using a candidate gene approach.

However, a new type of maize and soybean intercropping system (MSIS) with high land equivalent ratio (LER) provides substantial benefits for small-land hold farmers worldwide. Our research team has done a wide range of research to suggest the appropriate planting geometry that ensures high yield and LER as high as 2.36, nutrient acquisition and mechanical operations in MSISs. Increase in the distance between soybean and maize rows and decrease in the spacing of maize narrow rows is useful for the high light interception for the short soybean in MSISs. This review concludes that MSIS has multifold and convincing results of LER and compatible with mechanization, while those practiced other than China still require technological advancements, agronomic measures and compatible mechanization to further explore its adaptability.

In order to reduce this knowledge gap, we simulated the water requirement for rice, maize, and mungbean under rice-based cropping systems in the Dry Zone of Sri Lanka. We evaluated the best combinations of crops for minimum water usage while reaching higher crop and water productivities. We also assessed the risk of cultivating mungbean as the third season/sandwich crop (i.e. rice-mungbean-rice) in different regions in Sri Lanka. In the simulation modelling exercise, APSIMOryza (rice), APSIM-maize and APSIM-mungbean modules were parameterised and validated for varieties grown widely in Sri Lanka. Moreover, crop productivities and supplementary irrigation requirement were tested under two management scenarios i.e. Scenario 1: irrigate when plant available water content in soil fell below 25% of maximum, and Scenario 2: irrigate at 7-day intervals (current farmer practice). The parameterised, calibrated and validated model estimated the irrigation water requirement (number of pairs of observations (n)= 14, R-2 > 0.9, RMSE = 66 mm season-1 ha-1), and grain yield of maize (n =37, R-2 > 0.95, RMSE = 353 kg ha(-1)) and mungbean (n = 26, R-2 >0.98, RMSE= 75 kg ha(-1)) with a strong fit in comparison with observed data, across years, cultivating seasons, regions, management conditions and varieties. Simulated water requirement during the cropping season reduced in the order of rice (1180-1520 mm)> maize and mungbean intercrop = maize sole crop (637-672 mm)> mungbean sole crop (345 mm). The water productivity of the system (crop yield per unit water) could be increased by over 65% when maize or mungbean extent was increased. The most efficient crop combinations to maximise net return were diversification of the land extent as (i) 50% to rice and 50% to mungbean sole crops, or (ii) 25%, 25% and 50% to rice, maize and mungbean sole crops, respectively. Under situations where water availability is inadequate for rice, land extent could be cultivated to 50% maize and 50% mungbean as sole crops to ensure the maximum net return per unit irrigation water (115 Sri Lankan Rupees ha-1 mm-1). Regions with high rainfall during the preceding rice cultivating season are expected to have minimum risk when incorporating a third season mungbean crop. Moisture loss through evapotranspiration from the third season mungbean crop was similar to that of a fallowed site with weeds. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	"[Amarasingha, R. P. R.

Root growth of maize in an Italian ryegrass living mulch studied with a non-destructive method	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"Root dynamic; Mixed intercropping; Belowground competition; Green fluorescent protein; Minirhizotron"	"BELOW-GROUND COMPETITION; ZEA-MAYS L.; WEED MANAGEMENT; CORN PRODUCTION; FINE ROOTS; SYSTEM; NITROGEN; PLANTS; MINIRHIZOTRONS; PATTERNS"	The use of living mulch (LM) systems for maize (Zea mays L) cultivation may reduce soil erosion and nitrate leaching. However, the yield of maize cultivated in LM is lower than in conventional farming systems. This decrease has often been attributed to belowground competition, but the lack of a suitable method to demonstrate such competition has prevented further investigation. A recently developed method allows for the direct and non-destructive observation of root growth in LM. Maize expressing a green fluorescence protein was grown in monoculture or together with Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.). Root growth was screened in minirhizotrons from the time of sowing to the anthesis maize. Compared with the maize cultivated without Italian ryegrass, the cultivation in the LM significantly (p<0.05) reduced the shoot dry matter (56%), leaf area (39%) and mean root density (41%) of the maize at anthesis. An analysis of variance showed that the reduction due to the living Italian ryegrass in the root density of the maize was not significantly different from the reduction in leaf area. Similarly, the reduction in the root density and shoot dry matter of the maize were not significantly different. The roots of the LM maize grew in the soil where the LM was removed but also where the LM continued growing. This study constitutes the first direct quantification of root growth and distribution in a LM system. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DC.] have complementary growth habits, biomass production, and protein concentrations. We evaluated yield and protein complementation between maize and winged bean to determine if intercropping can improve the quantity and quality of maize silage. An early and a late-maturity corn hybrid were intercropped with 'Tpt1' winged bean at plant densities of 35 900 and 46 500 plants ha-1 in 1984 and 47 500 plants ha-1 in 1985 near Lexington, KY. In 1984, increased plant density resulted in increased maize vegetation, grain, vegetation N, and grain N yields per hectare (16, 21, 19, and 28%, respectively), while intercropping reduced maize grain yield and grain N yield per hectare by 8% each and reduced winged bean vegetation N concentration by 11% and yield per hectare by 40%. Intercropping winged bean with early maize produced 14% more biomass and 39% more N per hectare than did the reference early maize monoculture at post maize physiological maturity. In 1985, intercropping reduced maize vegetation, grain, and grain N yields per hectare (7, 14, and 14%, respectively), and reduced winged bean vegetation yield, N concentration, and N yield per hectare (58, 7, and 61%, respectively). Intercropping with early maize produced 18% more biomass and 67% more N per hectare, whereas intercropping with late maize produced 11% more biomass and 46% more N per hectare than did the respective monoculture maize. Land equivalency ratios for both dry matter and N yields per area were greater than unity for each plant density and intercropping system. Intercropping of maize with winged bean may provide greater biomass and improved protein content of silage in a temperate climate.

The amount of fixed N2 was estimated using the natural variation of N-15 and wheat as the standard non-fixing crop. Nitrogen as low as 15 kg N ha-1 at sowing suppressed nodule weight and activity (acetylene reduction activity) but not nodule number, suggesting that the main effect of mineral N was on nodule development and function. N-15 data revealed a high potential of the bean genotypes to fix N2, with the most promising ones averaging between 50-60% of seed N coming from fixation.

However, few studies have investigated the border effect based on photosynthesis, especially under rainfed conditions. Here, we evaluated the yield in rainfed wheat/maize strip relay intercropping, and explored the associated differences in yield components and physiological process compared to sole crops. A two-year field experiments was conducted including three treatments (sole wheat, sole maize and wheat/maize intercropping) in Yangling, located in the semi-humid region of northwest China. Grain yield, yield components, chlorophyll relative content (SPAD) and photosynthetic parameters in different rows were measured for wheat and maize. Results showed that wheat/maize intercropping increased the land use efficiency and total yield of wheat and maize under rainfed conditions. The yield of intercropped wheat was significantly (p < 0.05) increased by 35% on average over two years, resulting not only from the first border rows but also from the second border rows. The yield improvement in the first border rows relative to sole wheat was attributed to the increase of ear number (56%, p < 0.05), kernel number per ear (14%, p < 0.05) and thousand kernel weight (12%, p < 0.05), but the yield improvement in the second border rows was only attributed to the ear number (22%, p < 0.05). The yield of intercropped maize was not significantly (p > 0.05) decreased (6%), mainly attributed to the border rows (19% lower than in sole maize), in which the kernel number per cob and thousand kernel weight were 14% and 8% (p < 0.05) lower than that in sole maize. This was because that the SPAD and photosynthetic rate of maize in intercropping was suppressed during the co-growth period (about 62 days). Although the two had a partly growth recovery after wheat harvest, the growth recovery was not complete, and this was responsible for the reduction of maize yield in intercropping. This study demonstrates that the importance of yield components and the photosynthesis basis for yield advantage in intercropping systems, and reducing the adverse effect of dominate crop on subordinate crops could better exert the advantages of intercropping.

J	"Fischer, J; Bohm, H; Hess, J"				"Fischer, Jenny; Boehm, Herwart; Hess, Juergen"			Maize-bean intercropping yields in Northern Germany are comparable to those of pure silage maize	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"Organic farming; Zea mays; Phaseolus vulgaris; Phaseolus coccineus; Vicia faba; Total yield; Bean leaf mass; Crude protein yield"	"ZEA-MAYS; QUALITY; CORN"	Maize-bean intercropping is currently gaining popularity among farmers in Germany, although there is hardly any data available on the yield potential under moderate maritime climate conditions in comparison to pure maize cultivation as well as on the choice of the bean cultivar. To assess the agronomic potential of maize-bean intercropping for organic farming, field-experiments over two growing seasons were conducted in Northern Germany (53 degrees 46'N, 10 degrees 30'E). A split-plot design with two sowing times of the beans as main-plot-factor and different bean species and cultivars (Phaseolus vulgaris, cv.: Cobra, Eva, Tarbais, P. coccineus, cv.: Preisgewinner, Weifge Riesen, Vicia faba cv.: Isabell) as subplot-factor was applied. In both years, the average intercropping yield (11 t ha(-1) in 2011 and 14 t ha(-1) in 2012) of the two sowing dates was comparable to that of maize-control, except for Maize-Eva in 2011. The highest intercropping yields in 2011 were shown by cv. Tarbais and Preisgewinner with bean shares ranging from 34% to 39%. By contrast, the late-sown beans in 2012 had a share of 6-12% only, reflecting the overall higher maize yield level. Compared to maize control, the intercropping with Tarbais and Preisgewinner, which achieved the highest leaf mass scores, led to a significant improvement in crude protein yield by 36% and 18% in 2011, respectively. Earlier ripening bean cultivars (e.g. cv. Eva and Cobra) tend to lose their leaves before harvest. So cultivars with a longer growth period (e.g. cv. Tarbais), similar to maize, should be used to achieve high bean and crude protein yields. Our results demonstrate the importance of cultivar choice for achieving high bean yields that have the potential to improve feed quality. Tarbais and Preisgewinner were the most suitable cultivars for maize-bean intercropping, as they achieved the highest bean yields and improved the crude protein yield in 2011. Even though further optimization is indispensable, we have shown that maize-bean intercropping can fit into organic farming systems under moderate maritime climate.

Sustainable intensification of maize and wheat cropping system through pulse intercropping	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							"SANDY-CLAY LOAM; USE EFFICIENCY; YIELD; PRODUCTIVITY; NITROGEN; DENITRIFICATION; PROFITABILITY; ADVANTAGE; LOSSES; GROWTH"	The intercropping of legumes with cereals help to achieve sustainable intensification by their mutual complementarity at efficiently using radiation, nutrients, etc. Several studies indicated such beneficial effects on the other component crop however, little research has been conducted to quantify their effects on the subsequent crop in a cropping system. In this study, the effect of the legume intercropping on the entire cropping system, particularly the maize + legume-wheat system was studied. Four legumes intercropped to maize followed by wheat crop were studied for intensification measures such as wheat equivalent yield (WEY), land equivalent ratio (LER), sustainable value index (SVI), and economic returns. N saving effect of legumes on the subsequent wheat crop was quantified with two N levels. Maize + cowpea-wheat combination was the most productive and economic intercrop combination (LER = 1.71, SVI = 0.96) with an increase in net economic return (43.63%) with a B:C ratio of 1.94. An additional 25% N (37.5 kg ha(-1)) was saved in the wheat crop when the legume intercropping was undertaken with maize. The results suggest that intercropping is the key to diversification and reduces the risk of crop failures by enhancing land-use efficiency, soil fertility, and economic returns under weather vagaries. This will be beneficial to small and marginal farmers of many countries.	"[Tripathi, S. C.; Venkatesh, Karnam; Meena, Raj Pal; Chander, Subhash; Singh, G.

Effective mathematical statistics and modeling methods can improve the accuracy and reliability of pigment contents. In this study, field experiments were conducted with different water and nitrogen levels to develop a quantitative assessment model that determines chlorophyll (Chl) and carotenoids (Car) contents in maize. A pigment prediction model was established by vegetation indices (VIs), wavelet feature, uninformative variable elimination (UVE), and UVE based on continuous wavelet transform (CWT-UVE) and then compared with various methods. The wavelet feature dbl of maize leaf reflectance had a better correlation with Chl and Car with correlation coefficients (r) of -0.9247 and -0.8705, respectively. By using a calibration set, the best results for monitoring the Chl and Car status were observed using the rbio3.3-UVE-PLS, which indicated fewer variables. The R-2 and RMSE were respectively 0.9435 and 0.0937 for Chl, 0.8807, and 0.0130 for Car. In addition, tests conducted on the independent validation set showed that rbio3.3-UVE-PLS could be used to estimate the Chl (R-2 = 0.8534; RMSE = 0.1773; RPD = 2.6458), and bior3.3-UVE-PLS can be used to estimate the Car (R-2 = 0.8299; RMSE = 0.0187; RPD = 2.3832).

Residual effects of relay-cropped mucuna and lablab on maize and bean yields in northwest Kenya	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						"Residual effects; lablab; mucuna; residue quality; soil fertility; maize; bean"	"NITROGEN-FIXATION; SOIL FERTILITY; COVER CROPS; SAVANNA; QUALITY; BIOMASS; LEGUMES"	"In many areas of the tropics, soil nutrient depletion is a major constraint to food production. Performance of legumes relay cropped with a long-season maize (Zea mays L.) hybrid were studied to determine whether subsequent maize grain yield could be increased. Treatments were the factorial (2 x 2 x 3) combinations of two legume cropping systems [based on the legume used; mucuna (Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC. var. Utilis (Wright) Bruck) and lablab (Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet cv. Rongai)], two levels of legume defoliation (none or herbage above 10 cm from soil surface removed prior to residue incorporation into soil), and three crop sequences (legume in first year only, both years and second year only). There were three controls; (1) 30 kg ha(-1) inorganic N; (2) natural fallow and; (3) 5 t ha(-1) cattle manure. Mucuna yielded more herbage in the leaf fraction than lablab (1.6 vs. 0.86 t ha(-1)), and defoliation resulted in lower (0.76 vs. 0.13 t ha(-1)) leaf biomass. Lablab accumulated more biomass in the stem than mucuna (1.8 vs. 1.3 t ha(-1)). Leaf N accumulation for the defoliated mucuna treatment (D-M) averaged 48% that of undefoliated mucuna (UD-M), but for defoliated lablab (D-L), the value was only 4% that of undefoliated lablab (UD-L). When legume residue was applied for two consecutive years, UDL yielded higher (p < 0.006) maize grain than UD-M (6.72 vs. 4.46 t ha(-1)), and D-M resulted in higher (p < 0.028) maize grain yield than D-L (6.08 vs. 3.98 t ha(-1)). After 2 years of residue application, maize grain yield was greater for D-M than UD-M, but defoliation resulted in a reduction of maize grain yield under lablab treatments. The D-M (6.08 t ha(-1)) and UD-L (6.72 t ha(-1)) after 2 years of residue application, yielded higher maize grain yield than the natural fallow control (4.11 t ha(-1)). Residual nutrients from legume residue incorporation in March 2000 increased maize yield in the 2001 season over that obtained for a natural fallow. It is concluded that single-year or alternate-year intercropping of mucuna and lablab can increase subsequent maize grain yield, even when a portion of top-canopy legume biomass is removed as livestock fodder."

This experiment examined mycorrhizal assessment, chemical and microbiological soil attributes in a maize-forage grasses intercropping compared to a maize-monocropping system. A complete randomized block design was used with crop systems installed under no-till management with three replicates, as follow: Maize (Zea mays L.); Panicum maximum Jacq. cv. Aruana; Urochloa humidicola (Rendle.) Schweickerdt.; Maize-P. maximum intercropping and Maize-U. humidicola intercropping. In 2015/2016 season, intercropping maize with Panicum maximum Jacq. cv. Aruana or Urochloa humidicola (Rendle.) Schweickerdt. promoted similar effects (Tukey test, p<0.05) to monocropped maize under no-till system on soil chemical and biochemical parameters related to carbon cycling in the soil surface layer, as well as the dynamics of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in tropical soils, managed for a period of more than six years. Similar grain yield was verified among maize crop systems. This result indicates that intercropping maize-tropical forage grasses represents an alternative for monocropped grains, a very common practice that is used in intensive management, being able to guarantee equivalent productivities and to combine grain production with crop-livestock systems. As a result, intercropping promotes the diversification of the property's income source, adding environmental gains, such as more efficient land use by cultivated plants, keeping soil constantly cultivated, storing carbon and contributing to minimize the impact of climate change on agricultural systems and the sustainability of food production."

E. Smith) in maize cropping systems in Africa	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						"intercropping; push-pull; legume; deterrent; Lepidoptera; maize"		BACKGROUND: The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) is a serious pest of maize. Farming systems such as push-pull or maize-legume intercropping have been reported to reduce FAW infestations significantly. However, the exact mechanisms involved in FAW management have not been practically elucidated. We therefore assessed larval host preference, feeding and survival rate when exposed to four host plants commonly used in push-pull and legume intercropping. We also compared adult moths' oviposition preference between maize and other grasses used as trap crops in push-pull. RESULTS: The larval orientation and settlement study showed that maize was the most preferred host plant followed by bean, desmodium and Brachiaria brizantha cv Mulato II. The larval arrest and dispersal experiment showed that mean number of larvae was significantly higher on maize than on Desmodium or B. brizantha cv Mulato II. However, no significant differences were found between maize and bean after 24 h. Maize was the most consumed plant, followed by bean, desmodium and finally brachiaria. The mean percentage of survival to the pupation stage was significantly higher on maize. The study on FAW oviposition preference showed no significant differences in egg deposited between maize and other grasses. However, B. brizantha cv Xaraes, which received more eggs than maize, could be a promising alternative to B. brizantha cv Mulato II for the control of FAW. CONCLUSION: The study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the control of fall armyworm under the push-pull and maize legume intercropping.

Two different field experiments were conducted in 2012-2013 to analyze how different planting geometries in maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] relay strip intercropping systems at 2:2 maize-to-soybean affect yields. Maize plants were planted in narrow-row planting patterns, whereas soybean was planted in wide rows. The effects of bandwidth, row spacing, plant spacing, and the distance between maize and soybean rows on crop yields were studied. Total intercrop yields were higher than those of sole crop maize and soybean, and the land equivalent ratios of the intercropping systems were above 1.3. The yield of the intercropped maize increased with bandwidth reduction at the same plant density, and similar results were found with increased maize narrow-row spacing at the same bandwidth. Plant spacing had a dominant function when the bandwidth of the intercropped soybean was >200 cm. By contrast, the distance between maize and soybean rows had a dominant function when bandwidth was <200 cm. The optimum bandwidth and maize narrow-row spacing in maize soybean relay intercropping systems were 200 and 40 cm, respectively. These results suggest that the appropriate reduction in the spacing of the narrow maize rows and increase in the distance between maize and soybean rows could be used to achieve high yields in maize soybean intercropping.

Maize (Zea mays L.)/pea (Pisum sativum L.) strip intercropping may serve as a model for effectively boosting a system's productivity, However, how intercropped pea may compete for soil N sources with intercropped maize under various levels of N availability is unknown. Here, we determined the level of interspecific competition during the pea/maize cogrowth period, N-2 fixation of pea, complementary growth effect on maize, and yield responses of the two component crops. The field experiment was conducted at Wuwei Experimental Station in northwestern China from 2012 to 2014. Different N management practices were implemented in the pea/maize systems. Intercropped pea was the dominant plant, as shown by the highly positive competitive ratio (averaging 1.35) and its aggressivity (averaging 0.31) values compared with intercropped maize. Ameliorating N application in the maize/pea strip intercropping intensified the interspecific competition, improved the N-2 fixation of intercropped pea and increased the complementary growth of intercropped maize. On average, the N management system with 45 kg N ha(-1) applied as the first topdressing plus 135 kg N ha(-1) as the third topdressing increased the competitive ratio and aggressivity by 8% and 32%, respectively; improved N-2 fixation of the pea by 39%; enhanced the complementary growth of maize by 10%; and boosted the grain yield by 13% (maize) and 6% (pea) compared to the N management system with 135 kgN ha(-1) as the first and 45 kgN ha(-1) as the third topdressing. Significant positive correlations were found among the interspecific competition, N-2 fixation, and grain yield, clearly showing that improved coordination of interspecific competition can boost system productivity in maize/pea strip intercropping.

Studies were conducted to evaluate the productivity, weed dynamics, nutrient mining, and monetary advantages in the maize-legume intertropping systems. The highest yield, maize equivalent yield (MEY), and per day productivity were recorded in the plot of sole cowpea (CP) and plots of maize (M) intercropped with CP at row proportions of 1:2 (1M:2CP) and 1M:5CP. Density and biomass of grasses, sedges, and broadleaved weeds were lowest in the plot of sole CP followed by 1M:5CP. Weed smothering efficiency was highest (88%) in the plot of sole CP followed by 1M:5CP, and lowest in the plot of 1M: 1frenchbean(FB) (8%). Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium were removed less by weeds by intercropping M with CP than with any other legume at row proportions of 1:5. Uptake of nitrogen and potassium was high in the plot of 1M: 5 blackgram (BG) The net return, net return per dollar of investment, and marginal returns were high in the plot of 1M:2CP followed by 1M:5CP. Intercropping M with CP at a row proportion of 1:2 gave a higher yield and nutrient uptake, and lowered nutrient mining by weeds with higher returns. In an area where weeds are the major competitor with M for site-specific resources, intercropping M with CP at a row proportion of 1:2 or 1:5 will help to suppress weeds and also to obtain higher MEY. Higher yield gave better returns. Inclusion of legumes increased the uptake of nutrients by maize. This intercropping system may be found efficient in similar situations or land use elsewhere, especially in Southeast Asia.

The case of Zambia's maize-fertilizer subsidy program	WORLD DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						"Sustainable intensification; Fertilizer subsidies; Soil fertility management practices; Maize; Smallholder farmers; Zambia"	"FRACTIONAL RESPONSE VARIABLES; LONG-TERM USE; INPUT SUBSIDIES; AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION; ECOLOGICAL INTENSIFICATION; TROPICAL AGROECOSYSTEMS; CONTINUOUS CULTIVATION; SMALLHOLDER FARMERS; SOIL ACIDIFICATION; AFRICA EVIDENCE"	"Poor and declining soil fertility is a major constraint to increased cereal yields in sub-Saharan Africa. While input subsidy programs (ISPs) for inorganic fertilizer are a popular and expensive tool used by African governments to increase smallholder farmers' cereal yields, far fewer resources are devoted to promoting other soil fertility management (SFM) practices that can improve soil health, increase cereal yield response to inorganic fertilizer, and support sustainable agricultural intensification. Moreover, little is known about how ISPs affect farmers' use of such SFM practices. We examine whether and to what extent household participation in Zambia's maize-fertilizer subsidy program affects the household's use of fallowing, intercropping, crop rotation, and animal manure. Using nationally-representative panel survey data from Zambian smallholder farm households, we find that Zambia's maize-fertilizer subsidy program reduces the probability and extent of fallowing and intercropping of maize with other crops. In addition, we find some evidence that the program induces an increase in continuous maize cultivation on the same plot over time; however, the weight of the evidence suggests no statistically significant ISP effects on the use of animal manure. The analysis uses the Mundlak-Chamberlain device to control for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity and addresses concerns related to the endogeneity of selection into the subsidy program with an instrumental variables/control function approach. Overall, our results suggest that Zambia's maize-fertilizer subsidy program may have dis-incentivized sustainable intensification rather than promoted it. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd."

Intercropping reduces nitrate leaching from under field crops without loss of yield: A modelling study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"intercropping; model; nitrogen; leaching; environment"	"DRY-MATTER PRODUCTION; SIMULATION-MODEL; WINTER-WHEAT; COMPUTER-SIMULATION; NITROGEN NUTRITION; ORGANIC-CARBON; SOIL; MINERALIZATION; RESIDUES; TURNOVER"	A model of soil nitrogen dynamics under competing intercrops is described and used to interpret two sets of experimental field data from the literature. In one series of experiments, maize received slurry and mineral nitrogen (N) fertiliser or mineral N alone and was grown either alone or intercropped with undersown grass or with a subsequent rye catch crop during 7 years continuously. In the second system, the model compares field beans intercropped spatially at different densities with winter wheat. The model suggests that undersowing grass between the rows of an established maize crop can reduce concentrations of nitrate in water draining from soils during winter by 15 mg l(-1) compared with a conventional catch crop and by more than 20 mg l(-1) compared with a fallow soil. The model further suggests that the yield and profitability of mixed stands of commercial crops is inversely related to the residual nitrate at harvest (potential leaching). It is concluded that intercropping may be a useful means to reduce nutrient pollution from farming while maintaining yields. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, little is known about how the two intercrops compete for resources under resource-limiting environments. Here, we quantified the competitiveness of the intercrops in response to soil available N during their co-growth period, and determined the complementary effect of one intercrop to the other. A long-season maize was alternated in field strips with a short-season pea under four (N0, N1, N2, and N3) N management systems in northwestern China in 2012 and 2013. The maize-pea intercropping, coupled with N application, can enhance crop yield. Compared with N0 treatment, N application increased the competitiveness of intercropped maize to pea by 18 to 33% during the co-growth period. After pea harvest, the intercropped maize obtained a complementary effect, where it was grown under N0, N1, N2, and N3 managements increased the growth rate by 20, 21, 11, and 17%, respectively, compared with monoculture maize. The yield of intercropping system is a quadratic relationship with the interspecies competitiveness, with the competitiveness value of -0.059 to -0.076 being most conducive to improve the grain yield. We conclude that the treatment on 20% of the total amount of N top-dressed at maize jointing, 50% at pretasseling, and the remaining N topdressed 10 d postflowering provided the greatest benefits for minimizing intercrop competitiveness while enhancing the complementary effect among the four N managements investigated.

The inclusion of pea in cereal seeds and the increasing of its seed density led to substantial decreases in the grain yields of the cereal component. The reason for these decreases was the formation of smaller grains in cereals when intercropped with pea. The inclusion of pea in a cereal crop and the increasing of its seed density led to substantial increases in the protein content of the cereal grains. In barley and oats the increases in grain protein content were the lowest of the three cereals. At the same time, the maximum protein yield per area unit in cereals was obtained from plots of pure crops. In a mix with pea, the amounts of nitrogen consumed by cereals decreased and the protein yield of cereals per area unit were reduced in intercrops. Pea-cereal mixes had an advantage over cereal sole crops with regard to protein yield, due to the pea component. Pea-cereal mixes are particularly suitable for the conditions of organic farming, and should be recommended to farmers, as they ensure a relatively good harvest and high protein yield on soil without nitrogen fertilizers. In conclusion, the study showed that, of the three combinations, pea-oat mixed intercrops gave the highest yield of grain and protein yields.

J	Glowacka, A				Glowacka, Aleksandra			THE INFLUENCE OF DIFFERENT METHODS OF CROPPING AND WEED CONTROL ON THE CONTENT AND UPTAKE OF Fe AND Mn BY DENT MAIZE	JOURNAL OF ELEMENTOLOGY			English	Article						"maize; strip cropping; weed regulation; iron; manganese; content; uptake"	"SYSTEMS; CROPS; SOIL"	Strip cropping is a form of intercropping in which two or more species of plants are grown in adjacent strips. Strips should be wide enough for independent mechanical cultivation, but sufficiently narrow to allow for interaction between species. This may affect not only the size and structure of yield, but also the chemical composition of the plants. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of strip cropping and different weed control methods on the content of iron and manganese and uptake by dent maize. The study was conducted on a private farm in the village of Frankamionka in the district of Zamosc. It was run from 2004 to 2006. It consisted of a field experiment established on soil with an average Fe and Mn content. The experimental factors were two methods of cultivation: sole cropping and strip cropping (common bean, dent maize, and spring wheat in adjacent strips), and three methods of weed control: mechanical (inter-row cultivation applied twice), mechanical-chemical (the herbicide Gesaprim 90 WG 1.5 kg ha(-1) + single inter-row cultivation), and chemical (the herbicides Gesaprim 90 WG 1.5 kg ha(-1) + Milagro 040 SC 1.5 L ha(-1)). Maize was grown for silage and harvested at the milky-wax stage. Iron and manganese in the dry matter of maize were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) after digestion in HNO3 (extra pure) in accordance with PN EN ISO 6869:2002. On average for the experiment, strip cropping of maize with common beans and spring wheat increased the iron and manganese content in maize crop in comparison with sole cropping. The Fe and Mn content varied depending on the position of a row in strip cropping. Location adjacent to beans was more conducive to iron accumulation in maize, but reduced the manganese content. Strip cropping significantly increased the uptake of both iron and manganese by maize. The iron content was the highest where mechanical weed control was applied, while manganese was the highest where herbicides alone were used. The uptake of iron and manganese was the highest under the chemical weed control method. The results confirm the impact of strip cropping on the uptake of these minerals by maize and their content in the maize.

This study evaluated CA based cropping systems effects on maize yields with respect to herbicide use, crop establishment techniques and legume rotations in four contrasting agro-ecologies of Malawi and Mozambique from 2010/11 to 2013/14. No significant (p > 0.05) yield differences, at 4100 versus 3900 kg ha(-1) were observed in Malawi when CA was implemented with and without herbicides respectively, suggesting herbicides were not a precondition for CA's success. CA basins depressed maize yields by 3 % in north-western Mozambique and also offered no advantages in Malawi's lowland districts (Ntcheu and Salima). In contrast, significant yield gains (p < 0.05) emerged from dry Balaka (<600 mm year(-1)) with mean yields of 2400 from the CA basins compared to 1800 kg ha(-1) from farmer practices, an effect also confirmed by the yield stability analysis showing CA basins superiority in unfavourable rainfall environments. Thus CA basins performance was site dependent with no benefits on waterlogged soils or high rainfall conditions where direct seeded dibble stick or jab planting provided a better crop establishment option. Across all agro-ecologies, soyabeans, cowpea and groundnuts rotation systems, significantly increased maize yield, amounting to 20, 38 and 54 % respectively, except for the maize-common bean rotations in north-western Mozambique, which failed to offer any yield advantages. Probabilities of achieving higher CA yield ranged from 58 to 71 %. The study suggests CA based cropping systems offer an opportunity for intensifying maize production in the region.

Yam tuber yields varied between years (2013: 16.44Mg ha(-1); 2014: 10.08Mg ha(-1); 2015 26.61Mg ha(-1)). In 2013 neither tillage nor fertilizer affected tuber yields.

Maize grain yield was higher in sole crop in 2years. Fertilizer increased yields in all years (P<0.0001). Maize yield had no response to the yam densities.

Fodder productivity and profitability of different maize and legume intercropping systems	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						"Crop productivity; Farm profitability; Fodder; Fodder maize; Legumes; Intercropping"	"SORGHUM SORGHUM-BICOLOR; QUALITY; YIELD; ECONOMICS"	The current trend in global agriculture is to search for highly productive, sustainable and eco-friendly cropping systems. Intercropping of cereals with legumes is a recognized practice for economizing the use of nitrogenous fertilizers and increasing the productivity, quality, and profitability particularly in commercial grain crops but possibilities of fodder production in these intercropping systems is less explored. Availability of green fodder with improved quality to animals is the key to success of dairy enterprises and it is difficult to maintain the health and milk production of the livestock without supply of the quality green fodder. The growing of fodder crops in mixture with legumes has potential to improve palatability and digestibility of fodder (Kumar et al. 2018, Kumar et al. 2016). It is fact that about 65-70% of the total cost of livestock farming is attributed to feeding. However, green fodder production is a good way in order to curtail the cost on feed and fodder resources for sustainable livestock production. At present, the country is facing a net deficit of 35.6% green fodder, 10.95% dry crop residues and 44% concentrate feed ingredients. At the current level of growth in forage resources, there will be 18.4% deficit in green fodder and 13.2% deficit in dry fodder by the year 2050 (Anonymous 2015). The main objective of intercropping has been to maximize use of resources such as space, light and nutrients as well as to improve fodder quality and quantity. When legumes are used as intercrops, they provide beneficial effect on soil health by fixing atmospheric nitrogen, improving physical, chemical and biological properties. Hence, present study was undertaken in order to to assess the productivity, soil nutrient status and economics of different forage maize-legumes based intercropping systems.

Agronomic Performance Evaluation of Intercropping Two Common Bean Breeding Lines with a Maize Variety under Two Types of Fertilizer Applications in the Colombian Amazon Region	AGRONOMY-BASEL			English	Article						"aggressiveness; bean-maize intercrop; grain yield; land equivalent ratio (LER); plant competition"	"SMALLHOLDER FARMERS; COMPETITION INDEXES; PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS; DURUM-WHEAT; SYSTEMS; YIELD; CROP; ADVANTAGES; SORGHUM; BARLEY"	"Intercropping the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) with maize (Zea mays L.) is a widely used agronomic practice in smallholder farms in different regions of the world. Although it is a common practice in the Colombian Amazon region, crop yields are low due to the degradation of low fertility, acidic soil and high-temperature stress. Studies are needed on how the integration of genetically adapted common bean breeding lines into an intercropping system can benefit smallholders. The objective of this study was to: (i) evaluate differences in agronomic performance of two common bean lines when intercropped with maize in two different patterns under two types of fertilizer applications; and (ii) identify which intercropping pattern is better to maximize productivity and land use in the Colombian Amazon region. To achieve these aims, 2 field experiments (October 2018 to January 2019, season 1; April to June 2019, season 2) were conducted in the Colombian Amazon region. A randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications in a nested trifactorial arrangement in a split-plot scheme was used. The experimental design consisted of 2 advanced bean breeding lines of BFS 10 and ALB 121 (main plots); 3 cropping system patterns, including a monoculture, intercropping pattern 1, and intercropping pattern 2 (subplots); and 2 types of fertilizer, inorganic and organic (sub-subplots), for a total of 12 treatments. The experiment was conducted in two growing seasons in low fertility, acidic soil. Different competition indices and monetary advantage index values were estimated depending on the yield and cost of production from maize and bean intercropping patterns (land equivalent ratio, LER; relative crowding coefficient, RCC; aggressiveness index, AI; competitive ratio, CR). A significant effect on grain yield was observed with both intercropping patterns compared to monocropping of beans and maize. Grain yields obtained for maize were similar under monoculture with both types of fertilizer application, while both bean lines yielded better in monoculture under the application of inorganic fertilizer. Under intercropping patterns, the yield reductions were from 8 to 30% for maize and from 43 to 72% for the 2 bean lines. LER values increased with intercropping patterns under both types of fertilization, which was supported by positive values in the actual yield loss index. The interaction indices between the two crop components showed a greater dominance of maize over beans (RCC, AI, CR). However, the intercropping systems increased the economic advantage (the monetary advantage index) over monocropping. Smallholders in the Amazon region can profit through increased grain yield as well as land-use efficiency by integrating a genetically adapted bean breeding line, BFS 10, as an intercrop with maize under the application of organic fertilizer."

Here, we determine how competition with wheat affects nutrient uptake (nitrogen and phosphorus) and leaf traits, such as photosynthetic rate, in maize. In a field experiment, maize was planted as a sole crop, in three different intercrop configurations with wheat (a replacement intercrop and two add-row intercrops), and as a skip-row system with one out of each three maize rows omitted. Nitrogen and phosphorus uptake were determined at flowering and maturity. Specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen concentration, chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate of the ear leaf were determined at flowering. Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were significantly lower in intercropped maize than in sole maize and skip-row maize at flowering, but these differences were smaller at maturity. At flowering, specific leaf area was significantly greater in intercrops than in skip-row maize. Leaf nitrogen concentration was significantly lower in add-row intercrops than in sole maize, skip-row maize or maize in the replacement intercrop. Leaf chlorophyll content was highest in sole and skip-row maize, intermediate in maize in the replacement intercrop and lowest in maize grown in add-row intercrops. On the contrary, photosynthetic rate was significantly higher in the replacement intercrop than in sole maize, skip-row maize and the intercrop with an additional maize row. The findings indicate that competition with intercropped wheat severely constrained nutrient uptake in maize, while photosynthetic rate of the ear leaf was not negatively affected. Possible mechanisms for higher photosynthesis rate at lower leaf nitrogen content in intercropped maize are discussed.	"[Gou, Fang; van der Putten, Peter E.

The grain yield of maize grown after cowpea monocrop was doubled and the N uptake increased by 60% compared to maize following maize. The N-value of growing cowpea monocropped prior to maize monocrop was equivalent to the application of 50 kg N ha(-1) as mineral fertiliser. When maize followed a maize-cowpea intercrop, grain yield was increased by 67%. Around 34% of the N contained in cowpea residues was recovered in the following maize as estimated by N-15. There was however no benefit on the second season maize of applying sparingly soluble P sources to the first season legume.	"[Vesterager, J. M.; Nielsen, N.

However, this increasing crop yield costs large amounts of water used by intercropped plants. In addition, intercropping usually requires higher inputs that induce greenhouse gas emissions. Actually, it is unknown whether intercropping can be effective in water-limited arid areas. Here, we measured crop yield, water consumption, soil respiration, and carbon emissions of wheat-maize intercropping under different tillage and crop residue management options. A field experiment was conducted at Wuwei in northwest China in 2011 and 2012. Our results show that wheat-maize intercropping increased grain yield by 61 % in 2011 and 63 % in 2012 compared with the average yield of monoculture crops. The intercropping under reduced tillage with stubble mulching yielded 15.9 t ha(-1) in 2011 and 15.5 t ha(-1) in 2012, an increase of 7.8 % in 2011 and 8.1 % in 2012, compared to conventional tillage. Wheat-maize intercropping had carbon emission of 2,400 kg C ha(-1) during the growing season, about 7 % less than monoculture maize, of 2,580 kg C ha(-1). Reduced tillage decreased C emission over conventional tillage by 6.7 % for the intercropping, 5.9 % for monoculture maize, and 7.1 % for monoculture wheat. Compared to monoculture maize, wheat-maize intercropping used more water but emitted 3.4 kg C per hectare per millimeter of water used, which was 23 % lower than monoculture maize. Overall, our findings show that maize-wheat intercropping with reduced tillage coupled with stubble mulching can be used to increase grain production while effectively lower carbon emissions in arid areas.

EFFECT OF NITROGEN FERTILIZER APPLICATION RATE ON NITRATE REDUCTASE ACTIVITY IN MAIZE	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						"single variety; model plant; trichloroacetic acid solution; standard curve method; heading stage"	ENZYMATIC-ACTIVITY	In this paper, the effect of nitrogen application on nitrate reductase activity of the Sidan 19 maize (Zea mays L.) cultivar was studied. The Sidan 19 maize is a medium maturity maize single variety, which is a hybrid of 44/4 (Huangzao4 improved line) as the female parent and Mo17 as the male parent. It has high average hectare yield, good early-onset, easy to catch seedlings and other excellent properties, so it was selected as a model plant. In order to study the effect of nitrogen application on the activity of nitrate reductase in maize, the method of this paper is to prepare nitrate reductase, extract corn leaves, add trichloroacetic acid solution to stop the enzyme reaction, and use standard curve method to determine the content of maize nitrate reductase. The experimental results show that: (1) N application rate of nitrate reductase activity (NRA) was N300 > N200 > N100 > NO. (2) NRA activity of maize leaves was the lowest at the seedling stage, the highest at heading stage, and then decreased. Under 15% pec-6000 drought stress, 72 mmol/L salt stress and 72 mmol/L Saline-alkali stress, nitrate reductase activity of maize leaves and roots was the highest. (3) Under the same amount of nitrogen application, the nitrate reductase activity of maize roots increased, and the nitrate reductase (NR) activity of leaves was higher than that of roots under the same stress effect. (4) Under the same amount of nitrogen application, the nitrate reductase activity of maize leaves was the highest. At nitrogen levels of N-0, N-0.1 and N-0.5, the activity of nitrate reductase enzymes in roots of each treatment from highest to lowest were sodium nitrate > urea > ammonium chloride. It showed that the activity of nitrate reductase increased with the increase of nitrogen application. The nitrate reductase activity of maize root was the highest at heading stage, and under low nitrogen condition.

However, the mechanism by which intercropping sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) and maize controls this pest via compounds rinsed from leaf surfaces is still unclear. Electrophysiological and oviposition responses of the Asian corn borer to compounds rinsed from leaf surfaces of sugarcane and maize were studied. Coupled gas chromatographic-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) analyses revealed that O. furnacalis responds to 21 compounds, which are present in both the compounds rinsed from leaf surfaces of sugarcane and maize. The effects of these compounds in concentrations of 5 x 10(-3) g/mL or 5 x 10(-4) g/mL on female oviposition behaviour were tested. They were attracted to oviposit on substrates coated with most of the test compounds, except nonanal. It is suggested that the compounds from the leaf surfaces of sugarcane induced O. furnacalis females to oviposit because most of them are similar to maize's leaf surface compounds, which results in a reduction in the number of egg masses laid on maize leaves.

In the maize-soybean intercropping system, shade is a major causative agent that is triggered by the higher stem length of a maize plant. Many morphological and anatomical characteristics are involved in the lodging phenomenon, along with the chemical configuration of the stem. Due to maize shading, soybean stem evolves the shade avoidance response and resulting in the stem elongation that leads to severe lodging stress. However, the major agro-techniques that are required to explore the lodging stress in the maize-soybean intercropping system for sustainable agriculture have not been precisely elucidated yet. Therefore, the present review is tempted to compare the conceptual insights with preceding published researches and proposed the important techniques which could be applied to overcome the devastating effects of lodging. We further explored that, lodging stress management is dependent on multiple approaches such as agronomical, chemical and genetics which could be helpful to reduce the lodging threats in the maize-soybean intercropping system. Nonetheless, many queries needed to explicate the complex phenomenon of lodging. Henceforth, the agronomists, physiologists, molecular actors and breeders require further exploration to fix this challenging problem.

In this study, soybean-soybean mixed cultures were employed to illuminate P acquisition among plants in mixed stands of transgenic and wild-type soybean. Our results showed that transgenic soybean plants were much more competitive, and had greater growth and P uptake than wild-type soybean in mixed culture in both low P calcareous and acid soils. Furthermore, OXe plants had an advantage in calcareous soils when mixed with OXp, whereas the latter performed much better in acid soils. In soybean-maize mixed culture, transgenic soybean had no impact on maize growth compared to controls in both acid and calcareous soils with different P conditions. As for soybean in mixed culture, OXp plants had no significant advantages regardless of P availability or soil type, while P efficiency improved in OXe in calcareous soils compared to controls. These results imply that physiological traits could be easily affected by the mixed maize. Transgenic soybean plants with enhanced root traits had more competitive advantages than those with improved root physiology in mixed culture.

A study was conducted to generate evidence on the benefits of CARP in the long-term (nine years) in Salima District, Central Malawi. The objectives of the study were 1) to compare the maize yields between farmer practice and CARP interventions in the long-term, 2) to compare soil fertility changes between farmer practice and CARP interventions in the long-term, and 3) to verify the intercropping efficiency of maize with groundnut using the land equivalent ratio (LER) and land equivalent coefficient (LEC). A guiding hypothesis was that the application of CARP improves soil condition and maize yield. Farmer practice (FP) and three CARP [Pit planting + mulching (PPM), Intercropping + mulching (INM), and Mulching (MC)] treatments were tested in the study. INM was also tested for intercropping efficiency. Maize yields in CARP (3.98-4.43 Mg ha(-1)) were significantly higher (p < 0.018) than in FP (1.84 Mg ha(-1)). Soil pH, soil organic carbon, soil organic matter, nitrogen, and bulk density were acceptable for the Malawian soil in CARP compared to FP, suggesting that CARP improved soil fertility properties. There was no significant difference in soil potassium concentration across the treatments (p < 0.0642). The land equivalent ratio for maize and groundnut intercropping in INM was 1.77, indicating beneficial intercropping efficiency. The benefit-cost ratios (BCR) for PPM, INM, and MC were 1.55, 1.90, and 2.26, respectively, indicating that CARP interventions were more profitable than FP (BCR = 0.15). It is concluded that CARP interventions contribute to increased crop yield, income, and soil fertility restoration in the agricultural land. The selection of a CARP intervention should depend on the farmer's main intention, either to maximize yield, soil fertility, income, or a combination.

Photosynthesis, yield, energy balance, and water-use of intercropped maize and soybean	PLANT DIRECT			English	Article						"evapotranspiration; intercropping; photosynthetic capacity; water-use efficiency"	"AIR CO2 ENRICHMENT; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; GAS-EXCHANGE; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; EFFICIENCY; ADVANTAGE; SHADE"	By 2050, the U.S. Corn Belt will likely face a 23% increase in leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit (VPDL), the driving force of evapotranspiration (ET), which may restrict maize yield improvements for rainfed agroecosystems. Alternative cropping systems, such as maize and legume intercrops, have previously demonstrated yield and resource-use advantages over monocultures. In this study, the residual energy balance approach was used to gain insights into how an additive simultaneous maize and soybean intercrop system regulates ET and water-use efficiency (WUE) compared to standard maize and soybean monoculture systems of the U.S. Corn Belt. Experimental field plots were rain-fed and arranged in a randomized complete block design in three blocks. Photosynthetic capacity and grain yield of maize were conserved in the intercrop. However, its competitive dominance shaded 80%-90% of incident light for intercropped soybean at canopy closure, leading to a 94% decrease in grain yield compared to soybean monoculture. The total grain yield per unit area of the additive intercrop (land-use efficiency) increased by 11% +/- 6% (1 SE). Compared to maize monoculture, the intercrop had higher latent heat fluxes (lambda ET) at night but lower daytime.ET as the intercrop canopy surface temperature was approximately.25 degrees C warmer, partitioning more energy to sensible heat flux. However, the diel differences in lambda ET fluxes were not sufficient to establish a statistically significant or biologically relevant decrease in seasonal water-use (SET). Likewise, the increase in land-use efficiency by the intercrop was not sufficient to establish an increase in seasonal water-use efficiency. Intercropping high-performing maize and soybean cultivars in a dense configuration without negative impact suggests that efforts to increase yield and WUE may lead to improved benefits.

In arid areas, it is unknown whether the compensation can be improved via optimizing management of early-maturing crops. In this study, we developed an improved crop production pattern, i.e., plastic combined with 25-30 cm tall of three straw retention treatments, including straw standing (i.e., NTSS), straw covering (i.e., NTS), or straw incorporated into the soil (i.e., TIS), and one conventional deep tillage treatment without crop straw residue (i.e., CT) for early-maturing wheat in wheat-maize intercropping systems, to determine (i) the compensation effect of dry matter accumulation of intercropped maize after accompanying wheat harvest in different intercropping treatments; (ii) the secondary super-compensation effect (i.e., SCE) of intercropped maize based on dry matter transformation; and (iii) the comprehensive compensation effect of different intercropping systems, in comparison to monoculture maize with conventional treatment (i.e., CTM). The field experiment was conducted in northwestern China from 2009 to 2012. We found that the improved crop production patterns can increase the crop growth rate (i.e., CGR) of intercropped maize after the intercropped wheat was harvested, especially, NTS accelerated the compensation effect of intercropped maize, and shortened the compensation process of the intercropped maize. Straw retention increased contribution rate to grain yield by each organ in maize. Thus the SCE based on contribution to grain yield from leaf increased by 13.7%, increased by 14.9% from stem, and 32.8% from sheath, in comparison with CT treatment; NTS had higher SCE by 10.9%, 11.4%, and 26.2% from leaf, stem, sheath of maize, respectively, than those of NTSS and TIS. These results means that improved systems can improve the grain yield by 73.7% and harvest index by 11.7%, compared with the CTM treatment; NTS was the most productive pattern, boosted the maize grain yield by 16.4% and increased harvest index by 14.8% over intercropping maize with conventional treatment, during the three studied years. We can draw a conclusion that intercropping wheat and maize with straw mulching on the soil surface can be applied as an, effective straw management method in improving the super-compensatory effect of late-maturing maize, thus improving total yield in intercropping system in arid oasis areas.

It is quite often sparsely intercropped in cereal-based cropping systems in the subhumid zone of Ghana. Management of pigeon pea and its biomass is a promising means of improving many abandoned arable fields but has not been consciously undertaken. The objective of this trial was to explore the use of pigeon pea and the management of its pruned biomass as part of an improved fallow for crop-livestock farming. Three pigeon-pea management options and a natural fallow (two-year fallow period) were compared in terms of maize grain yield and changes in soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and cation exchange capacity. Pigeon pea grain yield ranged between 615 and 678 kg ha(-1) and 527 and 573 kg ha(-1) in the first and second year of fallow, respectively. In the first year after fallow, maize gain yield ranged between 0.43 and 2.39 t ha(-1) and was significantly influenced by the fallow system. There was a marked decrease in maize grain on the pigeon pea fallow plots in the second year, ranging between 50 and 38.6 per cent in Kumayili and between 42.6 and 17.6 per cent in Tingoli. After the two-year fallow period, increase of soil organic carbon on the pigeon pea fallow plot compared with the natural fallow plot was 30.5 per cent, and there was an improvement of total nitrogen (48.5 per cent) and CEC (17.8 per cent).

However, relay strip intercropping patterns have rarely been practiced in the semi-arid regions of Northeast China. Therefore, two years of field experiments of oat/maize, oat/sunflower, and oat/mung bean relay strip intercropping were conducted to determine the optimal yields and economic patterns. Treatments included sole crops of oat, maize, sunflower and mung bean, as well as three relay strip intercropping patterns consisting of six rows of oat alternating with three rows of maize, sunflower, or mung bean. The land equivalent ratio (LER) of intercrops varied from 1.10 to 1.14, 1.23 to 1.38, and 1.05 to 1.08 for oat/maize, oat/sunflower, and oat/mung bean, respectively. Relay strip intercropping systems presented distinct yield advantages, especially in oat/sunflower. The net incomes of oat/sunflower intercropping were estimated to be similar to 2000 $ ha(-1), which were significantly higher than both sole oat and sunflower. In oat/sunflower intercropping, kernel numbers per ear, ear numbers per meter row of oat and the thousand kernel weight of sunflower in border rows were 16-25%, 23-30% and 10-13% higher than inner row, well as thousand kernel weight of sunflower in border row increased 10-13% than inner rows, respectively. However, no positive border row effects were observed in the oat/maize or oat/mung bean intercropping systems. In conclusion, oat/sunflower relay strip intercropping is the most profitable alternative intercropping pattern in the semi-arid regions of Northeast China.

The soil is high in sesquioxides and soluble aluminum and has high phosphate sorption capacity. To address this problem, a field trial was conducted between 1996-1997 to assess the responses of six tropical cover crops and maize to lime and applied rock phosphate and to evaluate the effect of these treatments on the performance and P nutrition of succeeding maize. Results of the trial showed that planting Chamaecrista rotundifolia, Lablab purpureus, Mucuna pruriens, and maize-Chamaecrista rotundifolia intercrop reduced the leaf AI concentration of succeeding maize by more than 38%. Although none of the six cover crops significantly increased grain yields of succeeding maize, C rotundifolia was the most consistent in improving maize performance while Glycine max produced the least performance. Concentration of Mn in the index leaves of maize was significantly higher on plots where G. max preceded maize, thus accounting for the poor performance of maize on these plots. Application of Sokoto Phosphate Rock at 30 kg ha(-1) to cover crops produced very significant improvement in the yields of succeeding maize. While liming with 1.35 t CaO ha(-1) in 1997 raised the soil pH value by 0.2 and significantly improved total P uptake by maize.

Integrating winter camelina into maize and soybean cropping systems	INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS			English	"Article; Proceedings Paper"	International Conference on Industrial Crops - Promoting Sustainability / 28th Annual Meeting of the Association-for-the-Advancement-of-Industrial-Crops (AAIC)	SEP, 2016	Rochester, NY	Assoc Advancement Ind Crops		"Intersowing; Intercropping; Cover crops; Nutrient scavenging; Cropping systems"	"NORTHERN CORN-BELT; STRAIGHT VEGETABLE-OIL; SATIVA L. CRANTZ; COVER CROPS; FALSE FLAX; CRITICAL PERIOD; NITROGEN UPTAKE; SPRING WHEAT; WEED-CONTROL; CATCH CROPS"	Camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz.] is an industrial oilseed crop in the Brassicaceae family with multiple uses. Currently, camelina is not used as a cover crop, but it has the potential to be used as such in maize (Zea mays L.) soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] cropping systems. The objective of this study was to determine the agronomic performance of winter camelina intersown as a cover crop into standing soybean or maize prior to their harvest. Experiments were conducted in Fargo, ND in 2014, Prosper, ND, in 2015, and in Morris, MN in 2014 and 2015. The experimental design was a randomized complete block design with a split-plot arrangement with three replicates. The main plot was row spacing (61 and 76 cm in maize, 31 and 61 cm in soybean) while the sub-plot was maize or soybean growth stage at relay-sowing of camelina. Winter camelina was sown on four different dates: Date 1 (SD1), at the same sowing date as maize and soybean, Date 2 (SD2) at V4-V5 of maize and V3-V4 of soybean growth stages, Date 3 (SD3) at 'silking' of maize and R1-R2 stage of soybean, and Date 4 (SD4) after maize and soybean harvest. Camelina establishment into standing maize and soybean largely depended on rainfall after sowing. Camelina intersown on SD1 resulted in lower maize and soybean grain and biomass yield of 14 and 10%, respectively, whereas intersowing after SD2 had no significant effect on yield.. Camelina N accumulation varied between 24 and 59 kg N ha(-1) and P accumulation ranged between 4.3 and 9.2 kg P ha(-1) in the spring when sown after maize and between 14 and 57 kg N ha(-1) and 1.5 and 6.9 kg P ha(-1) after soybean. Results indicate that camelina intersown after V4-V5 of maize or V3-V4 of soybean stages will likely avoid competition with the primary cash crop. Camelina establishment and winter survival was best when sown after maize and soybean harvest, and tended to be greater in soybean. However, there are many unanswered questions on camelina intersowing management. New research will allow optimization of intersowing management to increase yields of both crops while enhancing ecosystem services.

However, relatively little is known about the drivers of adoption of these practices, especially for joint use. Moreover, it has been suggested that African farmers will respond to an increase in the maize price they expect to receive at the next harvest by increasing investment in their soils or altering use of SFM practices in response to input price changes. Yet previous studies largely ignore the role of prices. Using nationwide household panel survey data from Kenya, we estimate the effects of changes in crop and input prices on household use of individual SFM practices and combinations thereof. We find that Kenyan smallholders' SFM adoption decisions are largely insensitive to changes in expected maize prices. However, when inorganic fertiliser prices rise, farmers are more likely to use organic fertiliser and use less inorganic fertiliser per acre. These results suggest that price policies alone are unlikely to be effective ways to promote SI of maize production in Kenya.

Few studies have, however, separated selection and complementarity effects in economically valuable intercropping systems, which receive significant nutrient inputs throughout the growing season. We performed a 2-year field experiment with five cropping systems (i.e. maize/peanut intercropping, maize/soybean intercropping, maize, peanut and soybean monocultures) under different combinations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization. Sequential harvest of subplots was performed five times during the growing season and the additive partitioning method was applied to determine complementarity and selection effects in the two intercropping systems. We found that the land equivalent ratio (LER) based on yield was greater than or close to 1 in both maize/soybean and maize/peanut intercropping systems, suggesting yield advantages in these intercropping systems compared to monocultures. The LER of the two intercropping systems without N fertilization was greater in 2018 than in 2017. Nitrogen fertilization reduced the LER of maize/soybean intercropping in 2018, and that of maize/peanut intercropping across 2 years. Nitrogen fertilization had much stronger effects on maize yield than on soybean or peanut yield. Intercropping increased maize yield but decreased soybean and peanut yield. The CE was more important for net biodiversity effects without N fertilization while the SE was more important with N fertilization in the two intercropping systems across 2 years. Phosphorus fertilization impacts on the LER and biodiversity effects were weaker compared to N fertilization. Finally, net biodiversity effects were greater at later growth stages within a growing season. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates how yield advantages of species-diverse intercropping systems can be maximized either through (a) CE in the absence of N fertilization thanks to complementarity in nutrient use between crops or (b) SE under N fertilization thanks to overyielding of highly productive species (i.e. maize). Yield advantages promoted by CE are more sustainable because they are associated with reduced chemical fertilizer use and greater monetary benefits to farmers. These findings have important implications for the design and management of species-diverse intercropping food-production systems.

Maize yield data was obtained from plots under no-tillage as well as from conventionally tilled plots. Crop residues were retained in no-till plots, whereas they were removed from conventional tillage plots in line with current farmer practices. Rotations or intercropping systems with grain legumes were introduced at all sites. Fertiliser treatments were uniform across tillage treatments at each trial location but varied across countries, based on local fertilizer recommendations. Focus group discussions were conducted with farmers in the study sites to understand the constraints related to the successful integration of CA into the farming systems and to document farmers' perceptions about CA. In the majority of cases (80%), yield responses from a range of CA systems were greater than those of the conventional control plot at the respective site. In 20% of the cases there was a negative response to CA, due to lack of experience by farmers in the initial year, slow increase in soil fertility at the respective site and waterlogging in some years with too much rainfall. Yield advantages on two manual CA systems, planted with a dibble stick with sole maize and maize-legume intercropping in Malawi were 1152 kg ha(-1) and 1172 kg ha(-1), respectively. Animal traction CA systems had slightly smaller yield benefits (458 kg ha(-1) on a ripline seeded system and 761 kg ha(-1) on an animal traction direct seeding systems) as compared to a ploughed control treatment. Yield benefits increased with increasing years of practicing CA, highlighting the need to gain experience to master critical management steps such as timely planting, weeding, fertiliser application and crop harvest residue management. Yields from CA system responded better to increasing clay and silt content in the top soil and were more resilient to seasonal rainfall variability than conventional control treatments. Results suggest that the niche for CA in southern Africa is larger than expected although rainfalls regimes below 600 mm are challenging to sustain large maize biomass production to provide effective soil cover in CA systems. The success of CA implementation will largely depend on addressing critical challenges observed in the field, which will need adaptation of CA system to the site and farmer circumstances.

Part of this results from complementarity and/or compensation between varieties which can be assessed under mixed stands only. Mixing ability of varieties can be partitioned into General and Specific Mixing Abilities (GMA and SMA) that have been estimated so far through the evaluation of binary mixtures in complete diallel designs. However, the number of mixtures increases exponentially with the number of studied varieties, and the only feasible devices are incomplete designs. Despite the long history of statistical analysis of variety mixtures, such incomplete design analysis has rarely been addressed so far. To fill the gap, we proposed a generalized statistical framework to assess mixing abilities based on mixed models and BLUP method, with an original modeling of plant-plant interactions. The approach has been applied to a panel of 25 winter wheat genotypes observed in two contrasted experimental designs: (i) an incomplete diallel of 75 binary mixtures, and (ii) a trial including higher order mixtures (four and eight components). The use of mixing ability models improved prediction accuracy (of modeled values for observed traits) in comparison to predictions from the mean of the pure stand components, especially in the first experiment. Genetic variability was detected for the GMA of yield and its components, whereas variability for SMA was lower. GMA predictions based on the diallel trial were highly correlated with the GMA of the second trial providing accurate inter-trial predictions. A new model has been proposed to jointly account for inter and intra-genotypic interactions for specific mixing ability, thus contributing to a better understanding of mixture functioning. This framework constitutes a step forward to the screening for mixing ability, and could be further integrated into breeding programs for the development of intra- or inter-specific crop mixtures.

A field experiment was carried out during 2003 short rains and 2004 long rains in western Kenya to study the effectiveness of PREP-PAC on soil properties, maize (Zea mays L.), and legume yields of six maize-legume intercrops. The experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design, with four replications and two levels of fertility (no fertilizer and PREP-PAC). The maize variety, cv 'KSTP' (94), was intercropped with six legume types, namely: Bambaranuts (Vigna subterranean L., Var. Dark brown), Soybean (Glycine max L., Var. TGX 14482E), Yellow grams (Vigna radiate L., local type), Groundnuts (Arachis hypogaea L., Var. Uganda red stripped), Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L., Var. KK15), and Cowpeas (Vigna unguiculata L., Var. white type). The farm was characterized by low pH of 5.35, low soil available phosphorus (P) below the critical value of 10 mg P/kg, and generally low exchangeable cations. Results indicated a significant (P < 0.05) increase in soil pH, soil available P (P < 0.0001), maize and legume yields (P < 0.0001) throughout the cropping seasons. Intercrops with bambaranuts, beans, and groundnuts produced better legume yields compared to the rest of the legumes. Therefore, the authors of this study concluded that, PREP-PAC is effective with elevated N input (60 kg N ha(-1)) on restoring soil fertility and improving farm productivity in western Kenya. However, availability and accessibility of PREP-PAC in local markets needs to be improved.

Maize genetically engineered to produce insecticidal proteins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a potentially useful tool for controlling fall armyworm and other lepidopteran pests of maize in Africa. In the Americas, however, fall armyworm rapidly evolved practical resistance to maize producing one Bt toxin (Cry1Ab or Cry1Fa). Also, aside from South Africa, Bt maize has not been approved for cultivation in Africa, where stakeholders in each nation will make decisions about its deployment. In the context of Africa, we address maize production and use; fall armyworm distribution, host range, and impact; fall armyworm control tactics other than Bt maize; and strategies to make Bt maize more sustainable and accessible to smallholders. We recommend mandated refuges of non-Bt maize or other non-Bt host plants of at least 50% of total maize hectares for single-toxin Bt maize and 20% for Bt maize producing two or more distinct toxins that are each highly effective against fall armyworm. The smallholder practices of planting more than one maize cultivar and intercropping maize with other fall armyworm host plants could facilitate compliance. We also propose creating and providing smallholder farmers access to Bt maize that produces four distinct Bt toxins encoded by linked genes in a single transgene cassette. Using this novel Bt maize as one component of integrated pest management could sustainably improve control of lepidopteran pests including fall armyworm."	"[Van den Berg, Johnnie; Midega, Charles A.

In this metagenomics study, we evaluated the response of maize microbial functional gene diversity involved in chemotaxis, antibiotics, siderophores, and antifungals producing genes within the rhizosphere of maize plants under compost, inorganic fertilizer, and unfertilized conditions. The results show that fertilization treatments at higher compost manure and lower inorganic fertilizer doses as well as maize plants itself in the unfertilized soil through rhizosphere effects share similar influences on the abundance of chemotaxis, siderophores, antifungal, and antibiotics synthesizing genes present in the samples, while higher doses of inorganic fertilizer and lower compost manure treatments significantly repress these genes. The implication is for a disease suppressive soil to be achieved, soil fertilization with high doses of compost manure fertilizer treatments as well as lower inorganic fertilizer should be used to enrich soil fertility and boost the abundance of chemotaxis and disease suppressive genes. Maize crops also should be planted sole or intercropped with other crops to enhance the rhizosphere effect of these plants in promoting the expression and abundance of these beneficial genes in the soil.

Merr.] may produce more total yield per hectare than either grown separately, ie., land equivalent ratio (LER) > 1. Low N fertility, limited moisture, and weed competition have each been reported to result in high land equivalent ratios. Thus it was hypothesized that intercropping advantages were greater under stress conditions. The objectives were to study the effects of soil fertility stress (F1 = low N-P-K, F2 = high N-P-K), weed competition stress (W1 = unweeded, W2 weeded), and four cropping systems (M2S, M1S, M2, S; where M2 = high density maize, M1 = low density maize, and S = soybean at normal density) on the performance of maize and soybean, and on the growth of weeds. 'Cargill 921' maize and 'Union' soybean were planted simultaneously in 1985 and 1986 in alternate rows spaced at 0.5 m on a typic Hapludult in Maryland. Land equivalent ratios and maize equivalent yields were calculated. Dry matter production was determined early in the season, and grain yield plus weed dry matter were determined at final harvest. LER values (mean of 1985 and 1986) ranged from 0.89 (W1F1M2S) to 1.18 (W2F1M1S). The LER data showed that at high fertility levels, weed stress increased the relative advantage of intercropping. In addition, when plots were weeded, LER increased from 0.96 to 1.13 under fertility stress. Maize equivalent yields were calculated from the relative prices of maize and soybeans. The highest maize equivalent yields in all cropping systems in both years occurred under optimal conditions (W2F2)."

Integration of edible beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) into the push-pull technology developed for stemborer and Striga control in maize-based cropping systems	CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						"Intercropping; Push-pull; Maize; Bean; Striga; Stemborers; Farmers' perceptions; Economics; Western Kenya"	"FARMERS PERCEPTIONS; HABITAT MANAGEMENT; CHILO-PARTELLUS; PEST-MANAGEMENT; SOIL FERTILITY; DESMODIUM SPP.; STEM BORER; HERMONTHICA; SORGHUM; DIVERSITY"	Smallholder farming systems in eastern Africa are characterized by cereal/edible legume intercrops in fields severely constrained by parasitic weed, Striga hermonthica, cereal stemborers and declining soil fertility. The push-pull technology concurrently addresses these constraints. It involves intercropping maize with stemborer repellent fodder legume, Desmodium spp. (push), with an attractant crop, Napier grass, Pennisetum purpureum (pull), planted around this intercrop, thus making it difficult to interplant edible legumes. We assessed farmers' practice and perceptions on intercropping and willingness to integrate beans in their push-pull plots from a sample of 300 farmers in six districts in western Kenya. All the respondents traditionally intercropped maize with beans, planted either between the rows of maize, in the same holes with maize or in between maize plants within a row. The majority (92%) were willing to integrate beans in their push-pull plots. We, therefore, evaluated effects of integrating beans in the maize-desmodium intercrops. Treatments comprised a maize monocrop, maize-bean intercrop and three maize-desmodium intercrops, two of which were integrated with beans, either in the same holes with maize or in between maize plants in a row (bean integration plots), On-farm trials were similarly established among 56 farmers in four districts in western Kenya to assess the two integration methods. S. hermonthica counts and stemborer damage to maize were significantly lower and maize yields significantly higher in the maize-desmodium and bean integration plots than in the other systems. Overall, integration of beans in the maize-desmodium intercrops and the planting arrangement did not compromise the S. hermonthica and stemborer control efficacy of desmodium. Integration of beans significantly increased labour and total variable costs, with these being significantly higher in plots with both crops in different holes than in the same hole. Total revenue, gross benefits and benefit cost ratios did not significantly differ between the bean integration and maize-desmodium intercrops. Furthermore, these parameters were for most part not affected by the planting arrangements, both on-station and on-farm. These results show that integration of beans in the maize-desmodium and indeed push-pull technology while guaranteeing an additional crop, a protein source, to the farmers does not compromise the observed benefits of the technology but yields same economic benefits. Where labour is easily available, farmers are, however, advised to plant maize and beans in separate holes to avoid the risk of competition for moisture and nutrients where these might be limiting.

Comparisons were undertaken for progressive depths of extraction 0-300 mm; 300-600 mm and 600-900 mill respectively. These enabled the understanding of water extraction behavior of the cropping systems within the different soil layers including the topsoil surface normally influenced by soil surface evaporation. Additive intercrops have been known to conserve water, largely due to the early high leaf area index and the higher total leaf area. In this study, the combined effect of the intercrop components seemed to lower the total water demand by the intercrop compared to the sole crops. During the two seasons (2000/2001 and 2001/2002) the drained upper limit (DUL) and crop lower limits (CLL) were determined. The maize-bean intercrop, sole maize and sole bean had CLL of 141 mm/m, 149 mm/m and 159 mm/m respectively. The DUL was 262 mm/m for the site and therefore the potential plant extractable soil water for the cropping systems were: 121 mm/m (IMB); 114 mm/m (SM) and 103 mm/m (SB). Overall, the intercrop did not have significantly different total soil water extraction during both seasons, although it was additive, showing that it had higher water to biomass conversion.

Maize (Zea mays L.) as a main crop combined with a legume as secondary crop is in general use in many countries. These systems may contribute to a higher biodiversity, and reduced import of fertilizer, concentrates and agrochemicals. The objective of this research was to select an appropriate secondary crop that could be grown with maize in an intercropping system to control weeds while maintaining maize yields. Field beans (Vicia faba L.), crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.), phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia Benth.) and thyphon [Brassica rapa L. var. rapa (L.) Thell] were selected as secondary crops. Acceptable yields of dry matter in maize were obtained regardless of secondary crop. Different yield levels were obtained depending on the morphology of the secondary crop. Thyphon, a high, dense secondary crop with large leaves, shaded the lower maize canopy, and thereby reduced the yield of maize. In contrast, field bean, which is tall and has a narrow canopy, did not reduce maize yield. A negative relation was found between the yield of secondary crop plus weeds in August and October and the yield of maize in October. The secondary crops were not sufficiently competitive against weeds in the first part of the growing season. Thyphon competed too much against maize. Field bean and phacelia resulted in a minimum of competition against maize, and a maximum competition against weeds, compared with the other secondary crops.

Soybean growth and seed production were affected by the shading from maize. Previous studies confirmed that relay strip intercropping shading facilitates the accumulation of isoflavone glucosides but does not take advantage of the accumulation of isoflavone aglycone. However, the regulation of isoflavones accumulation under strip intercropping system was unknown; in which soybean and maize were sown at the same time, and soybean was mainly shaded in the reproductive stage. In order to reveal the effects of intercropping shading on the isoflavones accumulation in soybean seed, two independent field experiments were conducted in eastern China. We compared the isoflavones profiles of soybean seeds, which were grown under various maize-soybean intercropping systems with different shade levels. The results showed that the intercropping shading was not benefited to the accumulation of soy-isoflavones, including aglycones and isoflavones glycosides and various forms of isoflavones were decreased with the decline of photosynthetic active radiation. Multivariate statistical analysis and significance analysis showed that acylated isoflavones may be more susceptible to intercropping shading."

However, very few studies have explored the reason of its high LER, and the relationships between light distribution and the variations in radiation use efficiency (RUE) and LER in different intercropping arrangements. In this study, we conducted field experiments with different row arrangements of intercropping patterns from 2013 to 2015. The three different strip intercropping (SI) row arrangements were 0.2 m, 0.4 m, and 0.7 m (SI1); 0.4 m, 0.4 m, and 0.6 m (SI2); and 0.6 m, 0.4 m, and 0.5 m (SI3) for maize row distance, soybean row distance, distance between maize and soybean rows, respectively. The results showed that, as compared to single row intercropping, the strip intercropping increased the PAR at top of soybean canopy by 1.42 (SI3), 1.67 (SI2) and 1.93 (SI1) times, and increased the PAR at maize leaves close to the ear by 1.02 (SI3), 1.11 (SI2) and 1.12 (SI1) times. Moreover, the increased PAR at crucial positions in SI potentially improved the photosynthetic rate (Pn) for maize leaves close to the ear and radiation use efficiency (RUE) of maize by 1.08 and 1.09 times (averaged by SI1, SI2 and SI3), respectively, and improved the Pn of leaves at top of canopy and intercepted PAR of soybean by 1.75 and 1.36 times (averaged by SI1, SI2 and SI3), respectively. Compared to monoculture, SI also enhanced the RUE of intercropped maize (by 1.18 times) and soybean (by 1.51 times), which compensated for the partial yield loss caused by decreased crop intercepted PAR. Overall, in SI, intercropped maize achieved 90% of the monoculture yield, and intercropped soybean achieved 47% of the monoculture yield. With the expanding gap width for growing soybeans under a fixed bandwidth (2 m), the increasing intercepted PAR of intercropped soybean alleviated the interspecific competition disadvantage of soybean, while the reduction of maize row width decreased the dominant interspecific competition of maize. By adjusting the distances, we suggest that the optimal gap width for growing soybeans is 1.6 m-1.8 m, and the best maize row distance is 0.4 m. The SI2 achieved LER of 1.42, representing the leading level in the world."

Smith) is an invasive lepidopteran pest established in most of sub-Saharan Africa since 2016. Although the immediate reaction of governments has been to invest in chemical pesticides, control methods based on agronomic management would be more affordable to resource-constrained smallholders and minimize risks for health and the environment. However, little is known about the most effective agronomic practices that could control FAW under typical African smallholder conditions. In addition, the impact of FAW damage on yield in Africa has been reported as very large, but these estimates are mainly based on farmers' perceptions, and not on rigorous field scouting methods. Thus, the objectives of this study were to understand the factors influencing FAW damage in African smallholder maize fields and quantify its impact on yield, using two districts of Eastern Zimbabwe as cases. A total of 791 smallholder maize plots were scouted for FAW damage and the head of the corresponding farming household interviewed. Grain yield was later determined in about 20% of these fields. FAW damage was found to be significantly reduced by frequent weeding operations and by minimum- and zero-tillage. Conversely, pumpkin intercropping was found to significantly increase FAW damage. FAW damage was also found to be higher for some maize varieties, although these varieties may not be the lowest yielding. If the incidence of plants with FAW damage symptoms recorded in this research (32-48%, depending on the estimate used) is commensurate with what other studies conducted on the continent found, our best estimate of the impact of FAW damage on yield (11.57%) is much lower than what these studies reported. Although our study presents limitations, losses due to FAW damage in Africa could have been over-estimated. The threat that FAW represents for African smallholders, although very real, should not divert attention away from other pressing challenges they face.

Agricultural sustainable intensification (SI) has been proposed as a possible solution to simultaneously address these challenges. Yet there is little empirical evidence on if agricultural management practices and inputs that contribute to SI from an environmental standpoint do indeed improve food security or child nutrition. We use three waves of data from the nationally-representative Tanzania National Panel Survey to analyze the child nutrition effects of rural households' adoption of farming practices that can contribute to the SI of maize production. We group households into four categories based on their use of three soil fertility management practices on their maize plots: Nonadoption; Intensification (use of inorganic fertilizer only); Sustainable (use of organic fertilizer, maize-legume intercropping, or both); and SI (joint use of inorganic fertilizer with organic fertilizer and/or maize-legume intercropping). The results from multinomial endogenous treatment effects models with the Mundlak-Chamberlain device suggest that use of practices in the SI category is associated with improvements in children's height-for-age and weight-for-age z-scores relative to Nonadoption, particularly for children aged 25-59 months. These effects appear to come through improvements in both crop income and productivity."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the yield and nutrient release from forage crops intercropped with maize for silage, and soybean in succession. The study was conducted in the experimental area of Universidade Estadual Paulista, Ilha Solteira campus, Brazil. The experiment consisted of maize for silage intercropped with four forage species (Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu, Urochloa ruziziensis, Panicum maximum cv. Tanzania, and Panicum maximum cv. Aries) sown in three modalities: in the maize row, together with fertilizer; broadcast at maize sowing; and broadcast in the V4 stage of maize, in a randomized block design in a 4 x 3 factorial arrangement with four replications. The evaluation of nutrient release was performed during the soybean cropping that followed the intercropping by the litter bag method at 30, 60, 90, and 120 days after sowing of soybean. Panicum maximum cv. Tanzania showed higher dry matter yield when sown by broadcasting at maize sowing. Sowing of forages in the maize row, and through broadcasting at maize sowing led to greater dry matter yield for straw formation. Intercropping of maize with forages in the autumn is an alternative for increasing the amount of straw and cycling of macronutrients in a no-till system. Potassium was the nutrient with the greatest accumulation in the forage straws (up to 150 kg ha(-1)), with 100 % release at 90 days after sowing soybean. The forage straws are thus an excellent alternative for cycling of this nutrient. Panicum maximum cv. Tanzania sown by broadcasting at the time of maize sowing showed greater phosphorus cycling (13 kg ha(-1)). Panicum maximum cv. Tanzania broadcast in the V4 stage of maize is the option with least potential for straw production and nutrient cycling, while the other options (forages and sowing modalities) have higher potential for use, at the criteria of machine availability for setting up intercropping with corn."

The effect of bi-cropping wheat (Triticum aestivum) and beans (Vicia faba) on forage yield and weed competition	BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE & HORTICULTURE			English	Article						"Bi-cropping; land equivalent ratio (LER); resource-use efficiency; faba bean; forage yield; weed suppression"	"SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT; INTERCROPPED WHEAT; BARLEY; PEA; SYSTEMS; PRODUCTIVITY; SUPPRESSION; DENSITY; MAIZE; GROWTH"	Field experiments were conducted from April 2015 to September 2016 at the Royal Agricultural University, UK to explore the impact of drilling pattern and species mixtures on weed growth and forage yield. The bi-crops of spring field bean (Vicia faba) cv. Maris Bead and Fuego with spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) cv. Paragon were evaluated at four drilling patterns in a randomized complete block design with four replicates and compared against their respective sole crops. Weed DM was 59% higher in the sole cropping systems than the bi-cropping systems. The sole cropping systems outperformed the bi-cropping systems for wheat (in 2016 only) and for bean forage DM yield. However, the bi-cropping systems produced higher total forage DM yields than sole cropping systems. Weed DM was higher in broadcast than in alternate rows systems. Bean forage DM was 74% higher in treatments with alternate rows than in the broadcast treatment. Wheat forage DM was not affected by the drilling patterns. Maris Bead had higher forage DM than Fuego (in 2016 only). It was concluded that bi-cropping can increase land productivity per unit area over sole cropping, whilst improving forage DM yield and providing low cost integrated weed management. Alternate row drilling can improve bi-cropping productivity over the broadcast practice.

Farm- and community-level factors underlying the profitability of fertiliser usage for Ethiopian smallholder farmers	AGREKON			English	Article						"Maize; fertiliser; profitability; intensification; Ethiopia"	"SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; CYCLING EFFICIENCIES; INPUT USE; MAIZE; INTENSIFICATION; DETERMINANTS; RESOURCE; SYSTEMS"	While adoption rates for inorganic fertiliser are relatively high in Ethiopia, application rates are generally considered agronomically suboptimal. Using recent data on Ethiopian smallholder maize producers, we showed that maize response to nitrogen, and the profitability of fertiliser use depended on maize agronomy. The agronomic optimum ranged from 0 to 344 kg/ha with a mean value of 209 kg/ha. The actual nitrogen application rates were only about half the agronomic optimum, on average, and were less than the farm-specific economic optimum on 80% of maize fields. The average economic optimum level was 145 kg N/ha, but when we account for risk aversion, the resulting average optimum level is very close to the average observed usage level of 88 kg N/ha. Addressing risk aversion may help to induce greater levels of fertiliser investments at current prices and yield response rates. Our analysis also suggests that key pathways for increasing the economic returns to smallholder fertiliser investments include: complementing nitrogen inputs with phosphorus inputs and improved varieties, using lower levels of nitrogen under intercropping and manure inputs, enabling farmers to delay output sales beyond the immediate post-harvest period, and lowering the costs of accessing input and output markets.

Here, we examined in two years field experimentation the accumulation and translocation of dry matter and N in maize and peanut in pure stands and intercrops at five N input levels. Post-anthesis dry matter accumulation in the cob was on average 117 g plant(-1) in sole maize and 159 g plant(-1) in intercropped maize, of which post-anthesis dry matter translocation contributed 9 and 19 g plant(-1), respectively. Intercropping increased post-anthesis N accumulation of maize from 0.77 to 1.29 g N plant(-1) and N translocation to cobs from 0.94 to 1.16 g N plant(-1), but it decreased the contribution of post-anthesis N translocation to grain from 54.0% in sole maize to 46.9% in intercropped maize. The kernel number was 486 per cob in sole maize and 609 per cob in intercropped maize, and the thousand-kernel weight was 320 g and 336 g, respectively. In peanut, intercropping decreased postanthesis dry matter accumulation from 14.8 to 9.4 g plant(-1), post-anthesis N accumulation from 0.37 to 0.24 g N plant(-1) and N translocation to the pods from 0.25 to 0.14 g N plant(-1). The pod number per plant in peanut decreased from 10.6 in the sole crop to 8.6 in intercropping. Nitrogen fertilization increased dry matter accumulation and translocation in intercropped maize, but had little impact in sole maize or in sole or intercropped peanut. In both species, dry matter translocation to the reproductive organs contributed slightly to the yield, while the post-anthesis contribution of N translocation was of the same order of magnitude as that of N uptake.

Here we reveal that strip relay-intercropping increases the N, P, and K uptake and distribution across plant organs (root, straw, and seed) of maize and soybean, accelerates the dry-matter production of intercrop-species, and compensates the slight maize yield loss by considerably increasing the soybean yield. In a two-year experiment, soybean was planted with maize in different planting patterns (SI, 50: 50 cm and SII, 40: 160 cm) of relayintercropping, both planting patterns were compared with sole cropping of maize (SM) and soybean (SS). As compared to SI, SII increased the N, P, and K accumulation in each organ of soybean by 20, 32, and 18 (root) %, 71, 61, and 76 (straw) %, and 68, 65, and 62 (seed) %, respectively, whereas decreased the N, P, and K accumulation in each organ of maize by 1, 4, and 8 (root) %, 1, 10, and 3 (straw) %, and 5, 10, and 8 (seed) %, respectively. Overall, in SII, relay-cropped soybean accumulated 91% of total nutrient uptake (TNU) of sole soybean plants, and relay-cropped maize accumulated 94% of TNU of sole maize plants.

However, few studies have focused on the process of strip intercropping to increase natural enemy abundance, reduce pests and subsequently reduce crop damage. In the context of organic peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) production, maize (Zea mays L.) intercropping with peanut was proposed to provide habitat for predators that suppress peanut aphid to enhance pest control in peanut. To test this hypothesis, we compared predator communities across monoculture and intercropping systems, investigated shifts of predators in response to strip intercropping systems, and evaluated their prey consumption via PCR-based gut content analysis under realistic field conditions. Last, we assessed the biological control of peanut/maize strip intercropping in peanut production. Our results demonstrated that intercropping significantly increased ladybeetle density and significantly reduced the number of peanut aphids. In the peanut/maize strip intercropping plots, peanut aphid density was significantly related to ladybeetle density. Moreover, in the intercropping plots, more than 90% of the predators prefer to inhabit on maize, and less than 10% of the predators inhabit on peanut. Further molecular gut-content analysis revealed that the ladybeetles inhabited on maize exhibited significantly higher predation on peanut aphids in the intercropping system. Visualization of the food chains indicated that peanut aphid population in intercropping system was effectively suppressed by predator abundances in the early season. In the yield experiments, compared with the monoculture systems, the strip intercropping system presented significantly higher peanut production. Linear regression analysis revealed that peanut aphid significantly reduced the pod maturity index and peanut yield. Our results indicated that peanut/maize strip intercropping could enhance the predator number, suppress pest and reduce peanut loss. This research incorporating field studies and molecular tools demonstrates the successful conservation and biological control of peanut aphids.

Even though the effectiveness of push-pull in addressing these constraints has been evaluated under different agro-ecological conditions and on research stations, performance of the technology relative to other common maize-based cropping systems in farmers' fields and the impact of the push-pull age is not yet understood. We hypothesized that, a) maize grain yield and aboveground biomass from push-pull system is higher than other common maize farming systems; b) duration of use of push-pull, and climatic conditions have an influence on its efficacy; and c) the presence of legumes in maize farms positively affects system performance. We compared maize grain yield, aboveground biomass and striga emergence of push-pull system with common maize farming systems: (1) maize monocrop (2) maize-bean intercrop, (3) maize-cowpea intercrop, (4) maize-green gram intercrop, and (5) maize-groundnut intercrop in 45 farms in three contrasting sites (Vihiga, Siaya and Bondo) in western Kenya. Push-pull increased maize grain yield by 2.33 and 1.77 Mg ha(-1) in Vihiga in 2017 long and short rains, and 2.15 Mg ha(-1) in Bondo in 2018 long rains, and aboveground biomass by between 2.84 Mg ha(-1) in Vihiga in 2018 long rains and 8.94 Mg ha(-1) in Bondo in 2018 long rains. Striga emergence declined in push-pull systems by up to 100 % and its performance varied with sites and seasons. Farms that had practiced push-pull for less than 2 years had a higher number of striga than farms which had practiced it for more than 2 years for the first season; the number decreased and was similar to that for farms which had practiced push-pull for above 2 years in the two subsequent seasons. Farms with legumes had similar maize grain and aboveground biomass as maize monocrop in all sites and seasons, and higher number of striga in Siaya in 2017 short rains and 2018 long rains, and Vihiga in 2018 long rains. These findings show that push-pull is similar or superior to other maize farming systems in terms of maize grain and biomass production; and that while its performance is influenced by agro-ecological conditions, its efficacy in controlling striga increases over time, and its productivity is not compromised over time on the same farm."

On-farm evaluation of the 'push-pull' technology for the control of stemborers and striga weed on maize in western Kenya	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"'push-pull'; maize; striga; stemborers; pest management; Kenya"	"PENNISETUM-PURPUREUM VARIETIES; CHILO-PARTELLUS LEPIDOPTERA; BUSSEOLA-FUSCA; OVIPOSITION PREFERENCE; DESMODIUM SPP.; INSECT PESTS; TRAP PLANTS; STEM BORER; MANAGEMENT; HERMONTHICA"	The 'push-pull' technology is a novel pest management strategy developed for control of stemborers and striga weed, Striga hermonthica, in maize-based farming systems in eastern Africa, where maize is intercropped with desmodium, a forage legume, and Napier grass is planted as a border crop. Desmodium repels stemborer moths while Napier grass attracts them. Desmodium also suppresses the parasitic striga weed through a series of mechanisms ranging from shading to allelopathy through the root system. The technology is currently being disseminated among smallholder farmers in eastern Africa and adoption rates are rising. Our on-station studies have reported efficacy of this technology against the two pests resulting in increased grain yields. The current study was conducted between 2003 and 2006 in 14 districts in western Kenya to assess effectiveness of the technology under farmers' own conditions. Twenty farmers from each district, who had adopted the technology, were randomly selected for the study. Each farmer had a set of two plots, a 'push-pull' and a maize monocrop. Seasonal data were collected on percentage of maize plants damaged by stemborers, the number of emerged striga, plant height and grain yields. Similarly, farmers' perceptions on the benefits of the technology were assessed using a structured questionnaire. Stemborer damage and striga counts to maize plants were significantly lower in the 'push-pull' plots than in the maize monocrop plots. Similarly, maize plant height and grain yields were significantly higher in the former. Farmers rated the 'push-pull' technology significantly superior in having reduced stemborers and striga infestation rates and increased soil fertility and grain yields. These results demonstrate that the technology is equally effective in controlling both pests with concomitant yield increases under farmers' conditions in the districts studied.

However, existing FSPMs mainly address competition for light. The aim of the present work was to develop a comprehensive FSPM accounting for the interactions between plant architecture, environmental factors and the metabolism of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). Methods We developed an original FSPM by coupling models of (1) 3-D wheat architecture, (2) light distribution within canopies and (3) C and N metabolism. Model behaviour was evaluated by simulating the functioning of theoretical canopies consisting of wheat plants of contrasting leaf inclination, arranged in pure and mixed stands and considering four culm densities and three sky conditions. Key Results As an emergent property of the detailed description of metabolism, the model predicted a linear relationship between absorbed light and C assimilation, and a curvilinear relationship between grain mass and C assimilation, applying to both pure stands and each component of mixtures. Over the whole post-anthesis period, planophile plants tended to absorb more light than erectophile plants, resulting in a slightly higher grain mass. This difference was enhanced at low plant density and in mixtures, where the erectophile behaviour resulted in a loss of competitiveness. Conclusion The present work demonstrates that FSPMs provide a framework allowing the analysis of complex canopies such as studying the impact of particular plant traits, which would hardly be feasible experimentally. The present FSPM can help in interpreting complex interactions by providing access to critical variables such as resource acquisition and allocation, internal metabolic concentrations, leaf life span and grain filling. Simulations were based on canopies identically initialized at flowering; extending the model to the whole cycle is thus required so that all consequences of a trait can be evaluated."

Managing agronomic practices are the best way for insuring soil deterioration. Field experiments, in split plot design, were carried out in two summer seasons of 2017 and 2018 years at Nobaria, Behaira Governorate, Egypt, to investigate the effect of cropping systems and nutrients management on the nutrients uptake and utilize by maize (Zea mays L.). The experiment included three intercropping systems viz., sole maize; cereal/cereal and cereal/legume and four fertilization treatments viz., recommended dose of NPK (control); half of recommended dose; half of recommended dose+ organic manure (compost) 30m(3) ha(-1) and half of recommended dose+ organic manure (compost) 30m(3) ha(-1)+ inoculation seeds with multi strains microbial bacteria. Results confirmed that maize/legumes intercropped resulted in superior nutrients uptake and robust improvements in yield advantages. Additionally, intercropped maize/legumes and application the half dose of the recommended chemical fertilizers alongside 30m(3) ha(-1) of organic manure and seed inoculation with bacteria could mitigate soil nutrients deficiency, increased N, P, K and remaining an increase of final grain yields by 14.47% and 26.41% in both seasons, respectively. While, maize/cereal intercropped increased the uptake of Fe, Mn and Zn. Results highlighted that intercropping systems alongside integrated nutrients management could compensate the reduced dose of synthetic fertilizers. Such practices are the most effective practices can prevent nutrients deficiency and help small householder farmers to achieve high yield."

Destructive whole plant samples were taken of sorghum and maize to determine densities of the langosta species in plots managed under different planting dates, weed management, and insecticide application treatments in 1995. Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) was the dominant species while Metaponpneumata rogenhoferi (Moschler) and S. latifascia (Walker) were only present early in the crop-growing season. Mocis latipes (Guenee) was present in the mid- to late season. The langosta population density was kept below damaging levels and yield was increased for both sorghum and maize when thiodicarb (Semevin(R)) was used as a seed protectant in combination with delayed planting (five days after the beginning of the rainy season), delayed weed control (two to three weeks after crop emergence), and application of methomyl (Lannate(R)) insecticide as soon as eggs or first instar larvae were observed on the crop plants.

Field experiments were conducted for two consecutive years to investigate the mechanisms behind the increased yields of maize by increasing soil P availability in intercropping systems and how P application and companion crops influenced the process. The planting patterns and P fertilizer application rates significantly affected P taken up by maize. The increased yields of maize average increases of 22.67 and 12.60% for maize (Zea mays)/soybean (Glycine max) and maize/sweet potato (Dioscorea esculenta)intercropping, respectively; and 12.60 and 7.17% for maize/soybean and maize/sweet potato after P fertilization, respectively - indicated that the interspecific stimulation of P uptake may be a general phenomenon controlled by soil P availability and crop species. Under the maize/soybean intercropping system, considerable facilitation was observed when roots were not kept separate; suggesting that selective enrichment of competent species may be responsible for increased P uptake during intercropping. Positive interactions were supported by soil P activation processes that increased P availability, such as pH changes and acid phosphatase activity. In the intercropping of maize/soybean, acid phosphatase activity was significantly higher than that of maize/sweet potato. In accordance, soil acidification increased with root interaction. Soil acidification increased in maize/soybean intercropping with root contact as did acid phosphatase activity especially in P-deficient soil, which enhanced soil P availability. It was concluded that there was indeed P activation when maize grew with root interactions in the maize/soybean and maize/sweet potato systems. However, the facilitation was stronger in P-deficient soil. Interspecific interactions and P application together contributed to the yield advantage of intercropping.

Field experiments were conducted at two sites in western Kenya from 1996 to 1999 to study the effect of eight different intercrops on Striga populations and crop yield. Factors studied included relay or simultaneous planting of maize or intercrops, ridge and flat planting systems and in-row or between-row planting of intercrops. Mode of planting maize and intercrops (ridge/flat or in/between row planting) did not affect maize grain yield. However, ridge planting improved intercrop yields and reduced Striga densities. Peanut, bean, yellow gram, bambara nut and soybean intercrops produced considerable yields and increased the overall productivity of the cropping systems. The increase in output of farm produce ranged between 40% and 120% depending on the local agro-ecological conditions. Of the most productive intercrops, yellow gram provided the most stable Striga control over years and locations comparable only to cowpea. Peanut, bambara nut, bean and soybean were more variable in terms of Striga suppression in maize depending on the specific agro-ecological conditions. Shading, higher humidity and lower temperatures under the intercrop canopies were most likely the mechanisms which caused the decline of Striga numbers in intercropping systems. Intercropping can be an effective component of an integrated Striga control program compatible with the limited resources of small-scale subsistence farmers. In the long term, however, Striga populations can only diminish if intercropping is combined with handweeding of mature Striga plants to avoid the replenishment of the Striga seed bank in the soil.

Therefore, there is a need to increase the efficiency in water use by crops under rainfed agriculture. The effect of nutrient availability on the growth, production, root development, water relations and water use efficiency (WUE) by the intercrop maize/cowpea was investigated in 2 contrasting years (dry and wet) in the semiarid region of Brazil. The crops were grown on a strongly acidic, sandy soil with three treatments: (i) application of NPK fertilizers plus lime (NPK + lime), (ii) application of NPK fertilizers (NPK) and (ii) control (Contr.) in low and high input regimes. The soil water balance was calculated with the crop model EPICSEAR. Application of fertilizers and lime increased biomass production and grain yield of the intercrop up to 400% and 550%, respectively, and maize suffered more from the effects of low nutrient availability and soil acidity than cowpea. The root development of both crops was strongly improved by the application of NPK and lime and cowpea developed a deeper root system which enabled this crop to keep a higher transpiration rate in the dry year. As a consequence of the shallow root system, maize was prone to water stresses caused by the dry spells and its harvest index was reduced when dry spells occurred during flowering and grain filling. Fertilizers and lime application reduced deep percolation and soil evaporation while increasing the productive transpiration flow. WUE were improved through the application of nutrients and lime and maize showed higher WUE than cowpea. The omission of lime showed only minor effects on the evaporation and transpiration WUE. The model probably over-emphasizes the effects of high At saturation on the root growth and water uptake and consequently underestimated the transpiration rate of the crops. Nevertheless, the gross WUE was reduced up to 58% when lime was omitted and NPK applied at high inputs. A balanced fertilization in combination with lime improves the root development of a maize/cowpea intercrop in acid Acrisols of the semiarid NE of Brazil. The improved root development allows a better use of soil water reserves and increases the WUE of the system. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Hence, N-15-aided studies were made to ascertain the relative N-supplying ability of some cultivars of groundnut, a widely grown tropical legume. The study was conducted outdoors in 1991 at Kamburupitiya, Sri Lanka, in tanks filled with 64 kg soil which had been tagged by incorporating N-15-labelled plant material. Maize cv. Badra was grown as a monocrop and as an intercrop with five genotypes of groundnut, X-14, MI-1, Red Spanish, ICGV 87127, and a non-nodulating line. All the nodulating genotypes derived over 90% of their N from the atmosphere. Significant genotypic differences in N2 fixation were observed. X-14 fixed the highest amount (1.95 g plant-1), while Red Spanish the lowest (0.88 g plant-1). Intercropping of maize with nodulating groundnut significantly decreased the N-15 atom excess of maize, depending on the genotype. However, this decrease did not appear to be related to the amount of N2 fixed, based on aboveground material. The per cent N derived by maize from the intercropped groundnuts varied from 17% (X-14) to 39% (Red Spanish), indicating a marked genotypic variability in N-suppling ability. X-14, which fixed the largest amounts of N2, grew most vigorously compared to other genotypes, causing a growth depression in the maize. The genotype that fixes the most N2 may therefore not necessarily have the greatest N-supplying ability. The transfer of N from the legume and the consequent improvement of N nutrition in the associated cereal in low-fertility situations is therefore expected to be high when the growth of the legume is intermediate and does not suppress the growth of the cereal.

J	Piper, JK				Piper, JK			Growth and seed yield of three perennial grains within monocultures and mixed stands	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"Desmanthus illinoensis; Leymus racemosus; perennial grains; polyculture; relative yield total; soil; Tripsacum dactyloides"	"NITROGEN TRANSFER; ORGANIC-MATTER; GRASSES; DYNAMICS; MIXTURES; CARBON; MAIZE; INTERFERENCE; COMMUNITIES; GRASSLANDS"	This study examined growth and seed yield of three perennial species, Desmanthus illinoensis (Illinois bundleflower, a legume), Leymus racemosus (mammoth wildrye, a C-3 grass), and Tripsacum dactyloides (eastern gamagrass, a C-4 grass), in monoculture, biculture, and triculture treatments, on two soils differing in initial fertility, and over 5 yrs. There were significant effects of site, treatment, and year on both aboveground biomass and seed yield. On average, bundleflower monoculture produced the greatest aboveground biomass, although the three-species mixture produced the peak biomass (814 g/m(2)) in any given year. Among treatments, Illinois bundleflower monoculture yielded the most seed (maximum = 122 g/m(2)). Overall, biomass and seed yield were higher at the more fertile Site 1, but species differed in their dependence on soil fertility. Among species, bundleflower performed fairly independently of soil fertility, wildrye grew poorly on the less fertile soil, and gamagrass persisted at both sites although it grew less well at Site 2,. In most cases, mixtures produced as well as the best-yielding monoculture. In 26 of 30 instances, biomass relative yield totals (RYTs) were statistically > 1.0 and, in 19 of 21 cases, RYT for seed yield was statistically > 1.0. In general, the overyielding effect appeared stronger at Site 2 than at Site 1, with seed yield RYT appearing to increase with time at Site 2. The results show that the seed yield of perennials can be high, and that some species can persist in mixture for several years. The data for 5 yrs point to the need to follow long-term patterns of yield and interspecific interactions within perennial grain polycultures in order to maintain species diversity and to make reasonable predictions.

There were four treatment combinations in the experiment: sole maize; sole soybean; maize spaced at 50 cm and intercropped with soybean; and maize spaced at 65 cm and intercropped with soybean. The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The results showed that sole cropped maize and soybean generally outperformed the intercropped component crops. Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) was greater than 1 for all the intercrop treatments, indicating that it is advantageous to grow maize and soybean in association than in pure stands. Except for 2014 in Zaria, LER for inter - ropped maize spaced at 50 cm was higher than that for maize spaced at 65 cm. Gross Monetary Vilite (GMV) was generally higher for intercrops than sole crops except in Iburu in 2015 where GMV for intercropped maize spaced at 65 cm was similar to those of sole maize and soybean. Monetary Advantage Index (MAI) was positive for all intercrop treatments in both locations and years, which shows definite yield and economic advantages compared to the sole cropping systems.

All intercrop silages had higher crude protein values (MS, 137 g kg(-1), MRB, 120 g kg(-1) MK, 105 g kg(-1)) than maize (81 g kg(-1)). The neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) contents were higher and the neutral cellulase gamminase digestibility (NCGD) values lower for MRB and MS compared with maize and MS silage. All silages fermented well with pH ranging from 3.9 to 4.2 and ammonia-N content of less than 100 g kg(-1) total nitrogen (TN). An in vivo digestibility study with sheep showed no significant difference in voluntary feed intake between the four silages, with the highest and lowest values of 68 and 62 g DM (kg BW0.75)(-1) per day being recorded for MK and MS silage. The highest and lowest values for in vivo DM digestibility (DMD) and organic matter digestibility (OMD) were recorded for MK and MS silages, with intermediate values for maize and MRB silage. The inclusion of all three intercrops significantly increased nitrogen digestibility when compared with maize silage. The metabolisable energy values for maize and MK silage were both substantially higher than those recorded for MRB and MS silage. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, maize (Zea mays L.)- pea (Pisum sativum L.) strip intercropping with three maize densities (D1: 45,000, D2: 52,500, and D3: 60,000 plants ha(-1)) was compared to sole maize with three maize densities and sole pea. Soil water extraction and water difference were determined through soil water content over depth and across rows in intercropping, measured six times during the growing season. Land equivalent ratio (LER), radiation use efficiency (RUEGY for grain yield, and RUEBM for biomass), and water use efficiency (WUE) were calculated to compare intercropping with sole cropping. A soil water supplement potential from intercropped maize strips to intercropped pea was observed during the pea independent growth and co-growth with maize periods, which declined as the growing season progressed and with increased maize density. After pea harvest, the potential of compensatory soil water for maize existed from the pea strips, which was greater with increased maize density. Maize-pea intercropping produced 23-38% greater total yield than corresponding sole crops, as the LER ranged from 1.23 to 1.38. Maize-pea intercropping with D3 attained the greatest grain yield, RUEGY, RUEBM, and WUE among three maize density treatments, and was 10, 9, 17, and 14% greater than that of corresponding sole maize. Increasing maize density increased grain yield, radiation and water use efficiency, and LER, indicating that the intercropping advantage was improved with increased maize density.

It has been proven that N-fertilizer postponed topdressing can boost the productivity of cereal/legume intercropping. However, whether the application of this technology to cereal/cereal intercropping can still increase grain yield is unclear. A field experiment was conducted from 2018 to 2020 in the arid region of northwestern China to investigate the accumulation and distribution of dry matter and yield performance of wheat/maize intercropping in response to N-fertilizer postponed topdressing application. There were three N application treatments (referred as N-1, N-2, N-3) for maize and the total amount were all 360 kg N ha(-1). N fertilizer were applied at four time, i.e. prior to sowing, at jointing stage, at pre-tasseling stage, and at 15 days post-silking stage, respectively. The N-3 treatment was traditionally used for maize production and allocations subjected to these four stages were 2:3:4:1. The N-1 and N-2 were postponed topdressing treatments which allocations were 2:1:4:3 and 2:2:4:2, respectively. The results showed that the postponed topdressing N fertilizer treatments boosted the maximum average crop growth rate (CGR) of wheat/maize intercropping. The N-1 and N-2 treatments increased the average maximum CGR by 32.9% and 16.4% during the co-growth period, respectively, and the second average maximum CGR was increased by 29.8% and 12.6% during the maize recovery growth stage, respectively, compared with the N-3 treatment. The N-1 treatment was superior to other treatments, since it increased the CGR of intercropped wheat by 44.7% during the co-growth period and accelerated the CGR of intercropped maize by 29.8% after the wheat had been harvested. This treatment also increased the biomass and grain yield of intercropping by 8.6% and 33.7%, respectively, compared with the current N management practice. This yield gain was primarily attributable to the higher total translocation of dry matter. The N-1 treatment increased the transfer amount of intercropped wheat by 28.4% from leaf and by 51.6% from stem, as well as increased the intercropped maize by 49.0% of leaf, 36.6% of stem, and 103.6% of husk, compared to N-3 treatment, respectively. Integrated the N fertilizer postponed topdressing to the wheat/maize intercropping system have a promotion effect on increasing the translocation of dry matter to grain in vegetative organs. Therefore, the harvest index of intercropped wheat and maize with N-1 was 5.9% and 5.3% greater than that of N-3, respectively. This demonstrated that optimizing the management of N fertilizer can increase the grain yield from wheat/maize intercropping via the promotion of accumulation and translocation of dry matter.

Crop yields of species grown in strip intercropping are often related to the yield responses (increases or decreases) in the outer rows of the strips: the border rows. This suggests that the yield response can be modulated by changing the proportion of border rows in the field. Here we studied the relationship between component species yields and proportion of border rows in strip intercrops of maize (Zea mays L.) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea Linn.). We tested four different intercrops with equal proportions of maize and peanut but a different number of rows per strip: M2P2 (2 rows maize intercropped with 2 rows peanut), M4P4, M6P6, M8P8, and sole maize (SM) and sole peanut (SP). The border-row proportions were 1, 0.5, 0.33 and 0.25 for the intercropping M2P2 to M8P8, respectively, and 0 for the pure stands. Yield responded positively to the proportion of border rows for maize, but negatively for peanut, confirming the dominance of maize in this system. Kernel number per ear of maize and pod number per plant of peanut were the main yield components that responded to the border-row proportion. Across three years, relative maize yield (yield in intercropping divided by yield in monoculture), varied from 0.76 in M2P2 to 0.56 in M8P8, while relative peanut yield varied from 0.19 in M2P2 to 0.39 in M8P8. Relative yield total was not significantly different from one in any of the mixtures. Yield of intercropped maize in border rows was 48% higher than in inner rows and the sole crop, in part due to a significantly higher kernel number per ear (13%). Yield of intercropped peanut in border rows was on average 29% lower than in inner rows and 48% lower than in sole peanut. Yield responses in border rows were independent from the border-row proportion. The results show that relative crop yields responded strongly to variation in border-row proportion resulting from variation in strip width from 1 to 4 m. Strip width thus provides a mechanism to control the strength of interspecific plant interactions and relative yields in strip intercropping.

However, the prominent cassava cultivation system includes the intercropping of cereal crops and rapidly depletes soil fertility. Hence establishment of a sustainable foodcrop production system without cassava cultivation is required. A three-way experiment with maize-soybean-cowpea sequential cropping was designed to investigate the following main effects: tillage or no-tillage, mulching or no-mulching and government recommendation or farmers' traditional fertilization. Crop productivity and soil erosion were used as indicators of sustainability. At the end of the experiment, root system development of soybean was assessed to elucidate the cumulative effects of treatments on the soil environment for root growth. Fertilization treatments increased yields in all years, whereas mulching significantly increased only from the third year. The no-tillage treatment tended to reduce yields. Soybean root growth at surface level was markedly reduced by no-tillage and slightly improved by mulching. Erosion was reduced by mulching, no-tillage, and fertilization by the government recommendation. Because of its cumulative effect on increasing soil fertility and reducing erosion, the practice of mulching was highly recommended. A sufficient amount of fertilization (government level) was also recommended to maintain the fertility and to support sufficient plant growth to minimize erosion. The no-tillage practice was not recommended because it reduced crop yields, although the treatment efficiently controlled soil erosion.

The four systems tested consisted of the following: pure stand of maize (Zea mays) (T 1), maize intercropped with Mucuna pruriens (T2), maize plus Vicia benghalensis (T3), and maize plus Lablab purpureus (T4). Measurements taken included runoff, soil loss, percent crop cover and analysis of nutrients in the original soil and eroded sediments. Cumulative soil loss recorded during 1999 long rain season ranged from 58.64 to 61.7 t ha(-1). At the onset of the 1999 short rain season, soil loss was significantly different between treatments (P0.05). This was attributed to post-harvest crop cover provided by the legume cover crops grown from the previous season. The highest (3.3 t ha(-1)) and the lowest (0.35 t ha(-1)) soil losses were recorded from T1 and T2 respectively. There were significant differences (P0.05) in percent cover between treatments. The average percent cover taken at the onset of the 1999 short rain was 0, 43.2, 9.0 and 11.4% for T 1, T2, T3 and T4 respectively. Nutrients in sediments were compared with the original soil and the enrichment ratio (ratio of nutrients in eroded sediment to that of the original soil) for major nutrients (i.e. organic C, total N, available P, Ca and K) was greater than 1. The soil material lost from the plots was on average 262% richer in P than the original soil. The pH of the eroded sediments was slightly higher than that of the original soil. Soil management practices that improve the levels of soil organic matter; nitrogen and phosphorus should be encouraged for sustained productivity of these soils."

Fertilisers, as soil amendments, particularly K2O, could increase maize yields. A Two-year field research was designed in 2018-2019 to examine the influence of three-potassium fertiliser applications on maize-soybean strip intercropping and sole-maize yield components. A Randomized complete block design with three replications was used, and one of three K2O doses (T-0, 0; T-1, 40:30; T-2, 80:60 kg ha(-1)) was given in each plot. The effects K2O treatments on photosynthetic characteristics, photosynthetic active radiation, leaf area index, total biomass accumulation, and seed yield were investigated at V-6, R-2, R-4, and R-6. Compared to T-0, maize-soybean strip intercropping system and sole-maize results showed T-2 maize enhanced the light interception by 14, 26, 15, and 17% at V-6, R-2, R-4, and R-6 respectively. Maize increased the partitioning of biomass to cob and seed by 8 and 10% at R-6, respectively in T-2, relative to T-0 treatment. T-2 showed a higher green leaf area than T-0; K2O applications led to an enhancement in leaf area index at R-6 by 38%, under T-2, and subsequently increased the photosynthetic rate at R-4 and R-6 by 8% and 6% respectively, in both years of the study. These results suggest that we may increase the accumulation of biomass and the yield of the maize seed under maize-soybean strip intercropping system and sole-maize by optimum K application in maize plants."

Interactions of genotypes or beans with cropping systems and seasons were studied to determine if selection of bean in sole cropping would be a valid approach to genetic improvement for intercropping. In this experiment, 10 dry bush bean varieties were evaluated in sole cropping and intercropping with two types of maize (field and sweet maize) at two locations for 2 years. The performance of bean genotypes in each cropping system was compared with respect to developmental plant characteristics, seed yield and yield components and rood quality traits. A significant bean genotype x cropping system interaction was found for period of flowering and seed yield, and there were significant differences between cropping systems for pods per plant, seed length and seed coat proportion. Intercropping with field maize reduced bean yield by 55%, and intercropping with sweet maize reduced bean yield by 44%. Significant and high correlations of bean yields were obtained between sole cropping and intercropping with maize. Mean yields were used to calculate the land equivalent ratios (LERs), which averaged 1. 12 for intercropping with field maize and 0.93 for intercropping with sweet maize. Specific variety combinations reached LER values greater than one. Net income was higher for some intercrop patterns than for bush bean sole crop. The most competitive bean varieties yielded the most when intercropped with maize but those varieties were not necessarily the highest yielding in sole cropping. The most competitive bean varieties were the latest to flower. The evaluation of bush bean genotypes for agronomic and food quality traits under sole cropping provides sufficient information to select varieties efficiently for the field maize-bean and sweet maize-bean intercropping systems. Greatest net income was realized when bush beans intercropped with sweet maize, provided a system with higher added value compared to intercropping with field maize. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Comparison of the morphogenesis of three genotypes of pea (Pisum sativum) grown in pure stands and wheat-based intercrops	AOB PLANTS			English	Article						"Morphogenesis; Pisum sativum; plant architecture; plasticity; Triticum aestivum; wheat-pea intercropping"	"PLANT ARCHITECTURE; BARLEY INTERCROPS; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; MYCOSPHAERELLA-PINODES; N-2 FIXATION; SOIL N; LEGUME; MODEL; CROP; SYSTEMS"	Cereal-legume intercrops represent a promising way of combining high productivity and agriculture sustainability. The benefits of cereal-legume mixtures are highly affected by species morphology and functioning, which determine the balance between competition and complementarity for resource acquisition. Studying species morphogenesis, which controls plant architecture, is therefore of major interest. The morphogenesis of cultivated species has been mainly described in mono-specific growing conditions, although morphogenetic plasticity can occur in multispecific stands. The aim of the present study was therefore to characterize the variability of the morphogenesis of pea plants grown either in pure stands or mixed with wheat. This was achieved through a field experiment that included three pea cultivars with contrasting earliness (hr and HR type) and branching patterns. Results show that most of the assessed parameters of pea morphogenesis (phenology, branching, final number of vegetative organs and their kinetics of appearance) were mainly dependent on the considered genotype, which highlights the importance of the choice of cultivars in intercropping systems. There was however a low variability of pea morphogenesis between sole and mixed stands except for plant height and branching of the long-cycle cultivar. The information provided in the present study at stand and plant scale can be used to build up structural-functional models. These models can contribute to improving the understanding of the functioning of cereal-legume intercrops and also to the definition of plant ideotypes adapted to the growth in intercrops.

De-tasselling of maize before pollen shedding reduced the number of barren plants, and increased test weight and grain yield but de-tasselling after pollination had no significant effect. Defoliation of maize by removal of leaves below and above the ear, or by topping 30 days after 50% silking, had no effect on either maize grain yield or on that of the relay planted finger millet. This contradicts the hypothesis that increased light penetration due to reduced shading improves the yield of millet under maize.

Nodulating soybean, lablab, green gram and black gram contributed to the yield and N uptake of maize either intercropped with the legumes or grown after legumes as a sole crop. Direct transfer of N from the nodulating soybean, lablab, green gram and black gram to the intercropped maize was 24.9-28.1, 23.8-29.2, 19.7-22.1 and 18.4-18.6 kg N ha(-1), respectively. However, the transfer of residual N from these legumes to the succeeding maize crop was 18.4-20.0, 19.5-29.9, 12.0-13.7 and 9.3-10.3 kg N ha(-1), respectively. Four years of continuous lablab cropping resulted in yields and N uptake of the succeeding maize crop grown without fertilizer N that were comparable to the yields and N uptake of the succeeding maize crop supplied with 40-45 kg N ha(-1) and grown after 4 years of continuous sorghum cropping. It may therefore be concluded that nodulating soybean, lablab, green gram and black gram may be either intercropped or grown in rotation with cereals in order to economize the use of fertilizer N for maize production in the Nigerian savannah.

Separate fertilization (fertilizer for component crops applied separately to respective rows) gave 8.4% higher grain yield of maize than uniform fertilization (fertilizer for component crops mixed together and applied uniformly in rows irrespective of crops). Reduction in population of blackgram as an intercrop below 100% decreased the productivity of the system. Grain yield of intercropped maize was almost similar (4.O4-4.18 tonnes/ha) to its sole crop (4.32 tonnes/ha) when grown with 100% population (20 kg seed/ha) and 50 (10 kg N and 8.8 kg P/ha) to 100% (20 kg N and 17.6 kg P/ha) fertilizer to blackgram and component crops fertilized separately. This combination also gave higher grain yield (0.82-0.84 tonnes/ha) of the intercrop blackgram, suggesting that 50% fertilizer to blackgram could be saved without any significant reduction in production potential of the system. Maize + blackgram intercropping system with 100% population and 50% fertilizer to blackgram and fertilized separately to both the component crops gave maize-equivalent yield of 5.88 tonnes/ha and net return of Rs 10 470/ha.

However, issues about CO2 mitigation, water consumption, and the overall viability associated with the crop intensification have become a concern. The main objective of this study was to investigate how the yield related environmental factors, i.e. soil CO2 emission and crop water use would responsed to wheat-maize intercropping with conservation practices. Here we determined crop yield, plant biomass carbon, soil CO2 emission, and crop water use in various cropping systems. The field experiment was conducted at Wuwei Experimental Station in an arid oasis region (37 degrees 57'N, 102 degrees 37'E), in 2011 and 2012. Four tillage and crop residue options were applied to wheat-maize intercropping. They were (a) no-till with stubble standing (NTS), (b) no-till with stubble mulching (NTM), (c) reduced tillage with stubble incorporated into the soil (RTS), and (d) conventional tillage without stubble retention (CT). Averaged across two years, wheat-maize intercropping integrated with no-till and stubble mulching yielded 1.6 t ha(-1) more grains and 7.1 Mj ha(-1) more energy, while emitted 1.2 t ha(-1) less soil CO2 than conventional wheat-maize intercropping; at the same time, the system increased plant biomass carbon by 16%, and enhanced CO2 emission efficiency per unit of grain yield by 39%, compared with the conventional system. Also, the integrated system decreased soil evaporation by 11%, increased energy yield per unit of water by 19%, and lowered CO2 emission per unit of water by 9%. Among the wheat-maize intercropping systems evaluated, the treatment with no-till and crop residue mulched on the soil surface had the highest evaluation index at 0.82; this was attributable to the increases of carbon emission efficiency by 48% and water use efficiency by 22%, compared with the conventional system. Wheat-maize intercropping integrated with no-till and stubble retention can be used to increase crop yield efficiently while reducing soil CO2 emission and enhancing crop water use effectively in dry areas.

In arid environments, it is unknown whether the coordinated interspecific interaction can be improved via optimizing agronomic management measures. In this study, we quantified the competitiveness of the intercrops in response to straw and plastic management during both co-growth periods, and the compensation effect of each intercrop. A late-maturing maize (Zea mays L.) was alternately planted in field strips with an early-maturing wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under four straw and plastic management patterns in northwestern China from 2014 to 2016. Intercropped wheat was the dominant species, and the average index of competitiveness of wheat to maize (A(WM)) was 0.403. Integration of straw and plastic mulching application in wheat-maize intercropping reduced the interspecific competition and improved the compensation effect of intercropped maize. On average, no tillage with straw covering the soil in wheat strip combined with 2-yr plastic mulching in maize strip (i.e., NTSI2) decreased the A(WM) by 30.9%, increased the growth rate of the intercropped maize by 23.4%, boosted grain yield of intercropped wheat and maize by 9.7 and 17.6%, and boosted total grain yields by 14.9% compared with the conventional intercropping treatment (i.e., CTI). The grain yields of intercrops are a quadratic regression with A(WM), and A(WM) values of 0.354 to 0.375 are the most beneficial to boost the grain yields of the intercropped components. The NTSI2 treatment provided the greatest benefits for weakening the relative competitiveness of the intercrops while strengthening the compensation effect, and boosting the productivity of a wheat-maize intercropping pattern.

The HHLA (horizontally homogeneous leaf area) and ERCRT (extended row crop radiation transmission) models have been established to calculate the intercepted PAR for intercrops. However, there is still a lack of study on the intercepted PAR and RUE under different intercropping configurations using different models. To evaluate the intercepted PAR and RUE in maize and soybean under different intercropping systems, we tested different strip intercropping configurations (SI 1, S12, and S13 based on ERCRT model) and a row intercropping configurations (RI based on HHLA model) in comparison to monoculture. Our results showed that the intercepted PAR and RUE of intercropping systems were all higher than those of monoculture. The soybean intercepted PAR in strip intercropping was 1.35 times greater than that in row intercropping. In row intercropping (RI), the lack of soybean intercepted PAR resulted in a significant reduction of soybean dry matter. Therefore, it is not the recommended configuration for soybean. In strip intercropping patterns, with the distance between maize strip increased by 0.2 m, the intercepted PAR of soybean increased by 20%. The S12 (maize row spacing at 0.4 m and the distance between maize strip at 1.6 m) was the recommended configuration to achieve the highest value of intercepted PAR and RUE among tested strip intercropping configurations. The method of dry matter estimation using intercepted PAR and RUE is useful in simulated experiments. The simulated value was verified in comparison with experimental data, which confirmed the credibility of the simulation model. Moreover, it also provides help in the development of functional-structural plant model (FSPM).

A two-year maize-soybean intercropping (MSI) field study was performed in 2018 and 2019 to assess the effects of potassium (K) fertilizer application on biomass accumulation and distribution of essential nutrients in the various plant parts (root, green biomass and seed) of maize-soybean intercropping (MSI). Three different treatments of K fertilizer applications (T-0: no potassium application; T-1: maize 40, soybeans 30 and T-2: maize 80, soybeans 60 kg ha(-1)) were designed with 2 rows of maize by wide, narrow row planting in row arrangements of 160 cm + 40 cm. Soybeans were grown in 2 wide rows at a width of 40 cm and a row spacing of 60 cm between the rows of maize and soybeans, while the sole maize (SM) and sole soybean (SS) were grown with 70-cm and 50-cm row spacing, respectively. The results of the two-year study confirmed that, as compared to T-0, T-2 significantly increased nitrogen, phosphate and potassium (NPK) accumulation in all maize parts by 27%, 16% and 20% grain, 23%, 22% and 14% green biomass and 30%, 17% and 15% root, respectively. In soybean treatments, T-2 significantly increased NPK accumulation by 23%, 22% and 24% grain, 16%, 15% and 12% green biomass and 18%, 19% and 20% root, respectively. The increased accumulation of nutrients under T-2 raised the overall biomass and its distribution to root, green biomass and grain in maize and soybeans by 11% and 18% and 16% and 19%, 20% and 12%, respectively, compared to T-0. On average, after two years of experiments, the T-2 intercropped maize and the soybeans showed 103% and 64% of the sole yield and attained the maximum LER of 1.66 and 1.68, respectively. Our results reveal that managing optimum K level application (80:60 kg ha(-1)) can accelerate biomass accumulation and distribution of other essential nutrients in the plant parts of intercropped maize and soybeans. Therefore, it is immensely important to concern potassium application levels in developing a sustainable maize-soybean intercropping systems for achieving higher productivity and land equivalent ratio (LER)."

Organic matter input from a mixture of crop residues, such intercrop systems, influence N transformations differently compared to sole crops. We tested the hypothesis that N mineralization and immobilization differ between cereal-legume intercrops and sole crops. Methods A short-term experiment using N-15 isotopic pool dilution was conducted in 2007 and 2012 in maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) sole crops and 1:2 (1 row maize:2 rows soybean) and 2:3 (two rows maize:3 rows soybean) intercrops. Soil characteristics, gross mineralization and immobilization, and net immobilization to a 10 cm depth were quantified. Results Soil characteristics (pH, bulk density, soil organic carbon (C), total N, and C:N) were not significantly different (P<0.05) among treatments, but differed significantly (P<0.05) between years (2007 vs. 2012). Soil NH4+-N was significantly lower (P<0.05) in the maize sole crop. Gross N mineralization, immobilization and net immobilization, were significantly different (P<0.05) among treatments and between years. Relative NH4+-N immobilization was significantly different (P<0.05) among treatments and between years, showing the lowest values in the intercrops. The amount of NH4+-N mineralized per day was significantly greater (P<0.05) in the 2:3 intercrop and was significantly different (P<0.05) between years in the 2:3 intercrop. Residence time of NH4+-N was significantly longer (P<0.05) in the soybean sole crop and 1:2 intercrop followed by the 2:3 intercrop and the maize sole crop. Conclusions Intercropping contributed to the long-term immobilization of N and therefore was a more sustainable land-management practice than sole cropping. The adoption of cereal-legume intercrops will curb our currently growing reliance on N fertilizers.

The objectives of this study were to quantify carbon (C) and N inputs from crop residues and their rate of decomposition in maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) sole crops and two intercropping systems [1:2 intercrop (one row of maize and two rows of soybeans) and 2: 3 intercrop (two rows of maize and three rows of soybeans)]. Carbon input from crop residues was significantly greater (P < 0.05) in the maize sole crop and 2: 3 intercrop, but N input from crop residues was not significantly different between treatments. The amount of C and N remaining after 9 months of crop residue decomposition was significantly different between treatments, with the significantly lowest amount of residue C and N remaining in the soybean sole crop. The decay rate constant (k) and half-lives (t(1/2)) for crop residues C and N were significantly different between treatments. The highest k value was observed in the soybean sole crop and the lowest in the maize sole crop, whereas values for the intercrops were between those of the sole crops. Based on the values of crop residue input, the contribution of this organic material, the more difficult to decompose portion of soil organic matter was greatest in the maize sole crop followed by the 2: 3 and 1: 2 intercrops and the soybean sole crop. The amount of N mineralized was greatest in the soybean sole crop, followed by the maize sole crop, and the 2: 3 and 1: 2 intercrops. Results from this study contributed further information on the most optimal non-legume-legume configuration to maximize the long-term sequestration of C in the soil.

Herein, we investigated the process of microbial community assembly in maize, peanuts, and shared rhizosphere soil as well as their regulatory mechanisms on root exudates under different planting patterns by combining metabolomic and metagenomic analyses. The results showed that the yield of intercropped maize increased significantly by 21.05% (2020) and 52.81% (2021), while the yield of intercropped peanut significantly decreased by 39.51% (2020) and 32.58% (2021). The nitrogen accumulation was significantly higher in the roots of the intercropped maize than in those of sole maize at 120 days after sowing, it increased by 129.16% (2020) and 151.93% (2021), respectively. The stems and leaves of intercropped peanut significantly decreased by 5.13 and 22.23% (2020) and 14.45 and 24.54% (2021), respectively. The root interaction had a significant effect on the content of ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) as well as the activities of urease (UE), nitrate reductase (NR), protease (Pro), and dehydrogenase (DHO) in the rhizosphere soil. A combined network analysis showed that the content of NH4+-N as well as the enzyme activities of UE, NR and Pro increased in the rhizosphere soil, resulting in cyanidin 3-sambubioside 5-glucoside and cyanidin 3-O-(6-Op-coumaroyl) glucoside-5-O-glucoside; shisonin were significantly up-regulated in the shared soil of intercropped maize and peanut, reshaped the bacterial community composition, and increased the relative abundance of Bradyrhizobium. These results indicate that interspecific root interactions improved the soil microenvironment, regulated the absorption and utilization of nitrogen nutrients, and provided a theoretical basis for high yield and sustainable development in the intercropping of maize and peanut."

It was either planted as a pure stand or intercropped with lab lab plants. Maize tops were harvested after grain maturity (stage1) and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks thereafter (stages 2, 3, 4 and 5). The tops were stacked in the field (A), laid down in the field (B), or stored in a shed (C). A feeding trial with 12 cows was carried out to investigate DM intake, milk yield and composition. The cows were fed grass hay mixture (T1), green maize tops (T2), and maize stovers after grain harvest (T3) supplemented with lab lab forage and maize bran. Harvesting stages 1 and 2 yielded more tops (1.5 and 1.4 tonne/ha, respectively), higher crude protein, digestibility and metabolizable energy, lower acid and neutral detergent fibre than 3 to 5. The potential nutritive values were higher in maize tops stored in C than B and A. Total intake and milk yield were higher on T1 and T2 than on T3 (8.06 and 7.98 vs. 6.25 kg DM/day) and (5.05 and 5.02 vs. 4.4 kg/day), respectively. Milk components were similar. Harvesting stages 1 and 2 provided larger amounts of tops of high potential nutritive value than stages 3 to 5. Storing in a shed conserved nutritive value of green maize fodder better than laying and stacking methods. It compared well with grass hay mixture for milk production when supplemented with lab lab forage. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Using green manure to replace chemical fertilizers is one of the most effective solutions. To study the effect of green manure on the requirement for nitrogen fertilizer in oilseed rape, a field experiment with maize-oilseed rape rotation was conducted. Green manure was intercropped between rows of maize and returned after the maize harvest, with no green manure intercropped as control. Different nitrogen fertilizer treatments (0, 65%, 75% and 100% N rates, respectively) were applied during the oilseed rape season. The results showed that with a 35% reduction in nitrogen application rate, the rapeseed grain yield was significantly higher with the maize intercropping with green manure returned to the field than with the maize monocropping treatment at the same nitrogen level. Under conditions of intercropping and return of green manure, compared with the full standard rate of nitrogen fertilizer treatment, a reduction in nitrogen application of 25-30% in the rape season had no significant effect on rape yield. The agronomic efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer on oilseed rape increased significantly, by 47.61-121%, with green manure incorporation. In addition, green manure incorporation significantly increased the soil organic matter content and the soil-available nitrogen content when chemical nitrogen fertilization was abandoned. Benefit analysis showed that a 25-35% reduction in chemical nitrogen fertilizer applied to oilseed rape crops could be achieved by intercropping green manure in the maize season before the sowing of rapeseed in the experimental area. In the long-term, this measure would increase nitrogen utility, reduce production costs, and have concomitant environmental benefits of improving the quality of cultivated land.

In this study, we investigated how row configuration (e.g. the proportion of border rows) affected light interception (LI) and light use efficiency (LUE) in maize (Zea mays L.)/ peanut (Arachis hypogaea Linn.) strip intercropping. Field experiments were carried out for two years in 2015 and 2016. Four intercropping treatments were set as M2P2 (two rows maize and two rows peanut), M4P4, M6P6 and M8P8, with border-row proportion (BRP) of 1, 0.5, 0.33 and 0.25 under an equal land use proportion (0.5 for each crop). Two monocultures, sole maize and sole peanut (with BRP of 0), were set as controls. The LI was estimated by a light interception model developed for strip intercropping. Both light capture and light use efficiency of intercropped crops were significantly affected by strip width. The LI of intercropped high-stalk maize was 23.4 % higher while LI of shaded peanut was 32.2 % lower than the control. The LI of intercropped maize increased with the increasing of BRP. The LI of peanut decreased with BRP but did not show significant difference in low BRP treatment (i.e. in M6P6 and M8P8). The LUE differed within treatments in dry 2015 but not in wet 2016. In dry 2015, LUE of intercropped maize on average 13.6 % lower than the sole crop (2.05 g MJ-1), while LUE of intercropped peanut especially in M2P2 was 23.9 % higher than the sole crop (0.73 g MJ-1). The LUE varied daily and was significantly correlated with leaf area index and incident radiation intensity in both intercropping and the sole crops. Both LI and LUE responded to BRP and the responses differed between intercropped crops. The result could be used as a basis for explaining the mechanism of strip intercropping on light utilization, optimizing row configuration of intercropping design and improving light use algorithm of crop simulation model.

On average, intercrops produced 6% more dry matter and 17.5% more protein than the monocultures of maize, the most productive component. Both the dry matter and protein yields of intercrops were closely correlated with the yield of the maize component, but not with that of the soyabean component, indicating that there was no need for a specific breeding programme for maize to be used in intercropping systems. Although the average intercropping advantage, the monoculture yields of maize cultivars and, to a lesser extent, the monoculture yields of soyabean cultivars differed between locations, there was no evidence that the yield of various intercrop combinations differed between locations.

Yet the yield effects from maize-focused ISPs have been smaller than anticipated, due in part to poor maize yield response to inorganic fertiliser resulting from low soil organic matter or pH. Joint use of inorganic fertiliser with complementary soil fertility management practices-for example, organic fertiliser or maize-legume intercropping-can contribute to more sustainable forms of agricultural intensification, while also improving yield response to inorganic fertiliser and the effectiveness of ISPs. We analyse the effects of Tanzania's ISP from 2008 to 2014, the National Agricultural Input Voucher Scheme (NAIVS), on use of these practices. Results from correlated random effects (CRE) multinomial logit (MNL) models suggest that NAIVS participation is associated with an 8-10 percentage point increase in the probabilities of inorganic fertiliser use alone and of joint use of inorganic fertiliser with organic fertiliser and/or maize-legume intercropping on consistent maize-growing households' maize plots. CRE fractional MNL results suggest similar associations for the proportion of households' total maize plots area under these practices. These results suggest that, in some cases, NAIVS may have contributed to sustainable intensification of maize production.

There was least fall armyworm infestation under maize + greengram at 1:2 row ratio in 90 cm x 20 cm spacing (1.7 %) which followed maize + greengram in 75 cm x 20 cm spacing at a 1:1 row ratio (1.9 %).The study concluded that values of most of the intercropping indices were favourable under maize + blackgram and maize + greengram with alternate row at spacing of 75 x 20 cm and hence, it would be most advantageous for maize-legume cropping system in terms of land utilization and sustainable maize production with least pest effect.

Impact of nutrient management and legume association on agro-qualitative traits of maize forage	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article							ZEA-MAYS	A two years study pertaining to different agro-qualitative parameters of forage maize grown alone and in association with legumes and different fertilization regimes viz., control (F-0), 150 kg N ha(-1) (F-1), 150-100 kg NP ha(-1) (F-2) and 150-100-100 kg NPK ha(-1) (F-3) was conducted at the research area of the Department of Agronomy, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad. The results revealed that maize crop grown in association with cowpea and given fertilizer @ 150-100-100 ka NPK ha(-1) produced significantly the highest mixed forage yield of 58.62 t ha(-1) on the average. This treatment combination resulted in the increased leaf area index of 7.95 and 10.75 in the two consecutive years of study leading not only to enhanced crop growth rate but also mixed fodder of higher nutritive value as evidenced by its protein contents, compared to other legume intercrop combinations as well as maize alone.

It is unknown whether the impaired growth of maize can be recovered through the enhancement of the belowground interspecies interactions. In this study, we (i) determined the mechanism of the belowground interaction in relation to root growth and distribution under different maize plant densities, and (ii) quantified the recovery effect of maize after wheat harvest. The three-year (2014-2016) field experiment was conducted at the Oasis Agriculture Research Station of Gansu Agricultural University, Wuwei, Northwest China. Root weight density (RWD), root length density (RLD), and root surface area density (RSAD), were measured in single-cropped maize (M), single-cropped wheat on and three intercropping systems (i) wheat-maize intercropping with no root barrier (i.e., complete belowground interaction, IC), (ii) nylon mesh root barrier (partial belowground interaction, IC-PRI), and (iii) plastic sheet root barrier (no belowground interaction, IC-NRI). The intercropped maize was planted at low (45,000 plants ha(-1)) and high (52,000 plants ha(-1)) densities. During the wheat/maize co-growth period, the IC treatment increased the RWD, RLD, and RSAD of the intercropped wheat in the 20-100 cm soil depth compared to the IC-PRI and IC-NRI systems; intercropped maize had 53% lower RWD, 81% lower RLD, and 70% lower RSAD than single-cropped maize. After wheat harvest, the intercropped maize recovered the growth with the increase of RWD by 40%, RLD by 44% and RSAD by 11%, compared to the single-cropped maize. Comparisons among the three intercropping systems revealed that the recovery effect of the intercropped maize was attributable to complete belowground interspecies interaction by 143%, the compensational effect due to root overlap by 35%, and the compensational effect due to water and nutrient exchange (CWN) by 80%. The higher maize plant density provided a greater recovery effect due to increased RWD and RLD. Higher maize plant density stimulated greater belowground interspecies interaction that promoted root growth and development, strengthened the recovery effect, and increased crop productivity."

Factors contributing to maize and bean yield gaps in Central America vary with site and agroecological conditions	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						"El Salvador; Guatemala; Honduras; intercropping; production constraints"	"ECOLOGICAL INTENSIFICATION; CROPS"	In Central America, population and food demands are rising rapidly, while yields of staple crops, maize and beans, remain low. To identify the main factors limiting production, field trials were established in six maize- and bean-producing regions in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, representing about three-quarters of the maize-producing area. Potential yield-limiting factors were evaluated in 2017 and included: water stress, nutrient deficiency, pest and disease pressure, and/or inter-plant competition. When considering all sites, improved fertilization and pest and disease control significantly improved yields in maize by 11 and 16%, respectively but did not have a significant effect in beans. Irrigation had no effect due to good rainfall distribution over the growing season. Optimized planting arrangement resulted in an average 18% increase in maize yield, making it the most promising factor evaluated. The treatment and site combinations that increased both crop productivity and net profit included management changes that improved resource use efficiency. However, the contribution of each limiting factor to yield gaps varied across sites and no treatment was effective at increasing yield consistently across sites. Production constraints are highly dependent on local management practices and agroecological location. Therefore, public and private development efforts that seek to increase production should conduct multi-year, participatory experiments to identify limitations pertinent to the area in question. The next step is then to evaluate sustainable and profitable practices, to address those limitations and provide sound recommendations to farmers while decreasing the environmental and economic costs.

However, little is known about the best means for sowing such intercropped plants. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the agronomic characteristics of maize (Zea mays) as well as the productive and nutritional characteristics of Paiaguas palisadegrass (Brachiaria hrizantha cv. BRS Paiaguas) as the second crop in integrated production systems. The experimental design used randomized blocks with four replications. The treatments consisted of the following forage systems: monocropped of maize monocropped of Paiaguas palisadegrass, maize intercropped with Paiaguas palisadegrass in rows, maize intercropped with Paiaguas palisadegrass between rows, and maize with oversown Paiaguas palisadegrass. The results showed that intercropping of maize with Paiaguas palisadegrass does not interfere with the agronomic characteristics or grain yield of maize, regardless of the system that was adopted. Regarding the production of forage, low production of thy matter was found for Paiaguas palisadegrass oversown in maize, though the nutritional value was better. intercropping maze and Paiaguas palisadegrass is relevant to integrated production systems, as it allows for of a third harvest in the same crop year, which maintains sustainability especially because a smaller arable area is used compared to conventional systems.

Field experiments were carried out for four consecutive years, covering two complete cycles of the crop sequence, to evaluate the effects of pre-crops on crop yield, P uptake, and topsoil P balance of maize and wheat. Three pre-crops were used, i.e. fallow, pea, and rutabaga planted with two P levels with (+P) and without (0P) P fertilizer applied to maize and/or the wheat season. Pea significantly improved grain yield in cycle 1 and grain yield, biomass and P uptake of subsequently grown maize in cycle 2, compared with fallow, and P fertilizer application had no effect on maize yield, P uptake and above-ground biomass in cycle 1, but significantly improved yield and P uptake in cycle 2. Regarding the subsequently grown wheat, on average, pea significantly increased the wheat average yield by 11.57 % and 4.27 % under the 0P and + P treatment, respectively; and rutabaga had 5.22 % and 6.40 % higher wheat average yield than under the same conditions of fallow. Pea prominently improved the above-ground biomass, P uptake; soil Olsen-P in the 0-20-cm soil profile, and the inorganic Pi fraction concentration after two consecutive cycles, with a significant positive correlation between Olsen-P and most Pi fractions. Rutabaga prominently improved above-ground biomass and P uptake. The above parameters performed better under pea than rutabaga. P fertilizer application during the maize season barely affected the growth or P uptake of subsequently grown wheat, P applied during the wheat season, however, significantly enhanced agronomic traits and P uptake, and this effect was more pronounced under pea. We therefore conclude that pea as pre-crop is instrumental for subsequent maize and wheat production, and provides more benefits for farmers."

This study assessed the impact of intercropping maize (Zea mays) with pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) in Lixisols of Malawi on yield, biological N fixation, soil aggregation, and P forms within soil aggregates. Maize and pigeon pea were grown intercropped in pots, with varying degrees of root interaction in order to understand the relative importance of biochemical versus physical rhizospheric interactions. Following harvest, soils were separated into aggregate fractions using wet-sieving, and the nutrient content of all fractions was assessed. The proportion of macroaggregates and microaggregates increased by 52 and 111%, respectively, in the intercropping treatment compared to sole maize, which significantly increased organic P storage in the microaggregates of intercropped compared to sole maize (84 versus 29 mg P kg(-1), respectively). Biologically fixed N increased from 89% in the sole pigeon pea to 96% in the intercropped system. Intercropping maize with pigeon pea can have a significant and positive impact on soil structure as well as nutrient storage in these high P-sorbing soils. This is caused primarily by physical root contact and to a lesser degree by biochemical activities.

A pot experiment was conducted to verify whether maize and soybean under monoculture and intercropping could utilise N- and S-containing amino acids when competing with soil microorganisms. Maize and soybean were able to utilise methionine (Met; 1.9-2.2% of total addition) and cysteine (Cys; 0.6-1.6% of total addition) as N and S sources, however they faced competition with soil microorganisms. Six hours after microbial uptake, 45.3-64.0% of the S from Met was retained in the microbial biomass, while there was much lower retention from Cys (16.8-34.5%), and 32.5-44.1% of the S from Cys and 15.6-33.3% of that from Met was transformed to SO42-. Cys was a superior S source for plants compared to Met, as higher SO42- release from Cys could support plant growth. Both maize and soybean plants took up NH4+ (98-99% of total N uptake) and SO42- (85-90%) as their main N and S sources from soil. The N from Cys and Met accounted for only similar to 1% of total N uptake from soil, and organic Cys and Met accounted for only similar to 0.2% of the total N uptake, indicating that these two amino acids have limited effects on plant N nutrition, due to the high inorganic N content in agricultural soil. However, the Cys and Met contribution (i.e., organic S uptake and mineral S uptake originating from Cys and Met) to total S uptake (10-15%) was an order of magnitude higher than their N contributions, suggesting that Cys and Met play an important role in soil S nutrition. Intercropping altered the uptake but not the preference for N and S forms in maize and soybean. Overall, the results suggest that S-containing amino acids are important S sources for plant growth even at a lower concentration in soil, but that they play a limited role in plant N nutrition due to a larger inorganic N pool in agricultural soil."

Conservation Agriculture for Maize and Bean Production in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							"TILLAGE TECHNIQUES; COVER CROPS; SOIL; SYSTEMS; EROSION; AFRICA; PARANA; BRAZIL"	Conservation agriculture (CA) can be a means to soil improvement and increased crop productivity but had not been evaluated for maize (Zea mays L.)-dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cropping systems in the semiarid Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia (CRV). Th erefore, on-farm (2011-2014) and on-station (2010-2014) trials were conducted to compare CA with the current smallholder conventional practice (CP) for productivity of maize-bean cropping systems. Maize monoculture (MMC), bean monoculture (BMC), maize-bean rotation (MBR), and maize-bean intercropping (MBI) were compared with and without tillage on-station. In on-farm research, MMC under CP (CP_MMC) was compared with cropping systems under CA including MMC (CA_MMC), MBR (CA_MBR), and MBI (CA_MBI). On-station, CA had late tasseling, silking, and physiological maturity compared to CP. CA_MBR and CA_MBI had 28 and 19% more maize grain yield and 29 and 17% more stover yield compared with CA_MMC, respectively. Bean straw yield and intercrop bean grain yield were 13 and 7% more, respectively, with CA compared with CP. However, in the on-farm trials, maize grain and stover yield were 23 and 47% less with CA_MBR compared to CA_MMC, possibly due to observed soil crusting and compaction of the sandy clay soil with CA. Soil water at 0-to 30- and 0-to 100-cm depths were 38 and 28%, respectively, more with MBR compared to MMC at the maize grain-fill stage. Stored soil water was 21% more with CA compared with CP. We conclude that CA_MBR and CA_MBI are suitable for fine texture soil of the CRV.	"[Liben, F. M.; Wortmann, C. S.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Agron & Hort, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Hassen, S.

However, the underlying mechanisms of these interactions are not fully understood. A two-year field experiment with two nitrogen fertilizer levels was performed on a calcareous soil, to study Fe and N nutrition and yield of a peanut-maize intercrop (IC). In order to identify belowground interspecific interactions, root barriers were employed between adjacent peanut and maize rows. Chlorophyll (measured by SPAD) and active iron concentration in peanut leaves, total Fe and N concentrations, acquisitions, and grain yield were determined. IC increased SPAD values and active iron concentrations in young peanut leaves and alleviated peanut Fe deficiency chlorosis compared with sole-crop (SC) peanut. Total Fe and N concentrations in IC peanut were higher than those in SC peanut, and Fe and N accumulations per plant were also higher than in SC peanut without N fertilizer. IC did not significantly influence Fe concentration in IC maize, but improved N concentration. IC significantly decreased Fe and N acquisition per ha and grain yield of peanut and maize components compared with the respective SC. However, the combined Fe and Ne acquisition per ha in the IC was significantly higher than the weighted mean of the SC systems. The land equivalent ratios (LERFe, LERN and LERgrain) were greater than 1, but decreased to close to 1 with root barriers. Supplying N fertilizer increased grain yield and Fe and N acquisition in the IC, but significantly decreased LERFe, LERN, and LERgrain, confirming that N availability and use are important for determining intercrop advantages. The effect of physical root barriers between rows of peanut and maize indicates that belowground mutual interspecific interactions regarding Fe and N acquisition plays a major role for determining the advantages of peanut-maize IC on calcareous soils.

Maize-legume intercropping in central Malawi: determinants of practice	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						"Smallholder farmers; intercropping; sustainable intensification; legumes; soil fertility; food security; Malawi"	"SOIL FERTILITY MANAGEMENT; SUSTAINABLE FOOD SECURITY; SMALLHOLDER FARMERS; CROPPING SYSTEMS; AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY; LIVELIHOOD STRATEGIES; TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION; HOUSEHOLD-LEVEL; RURAL POVERTY; BURKINA-FASO"	"In Malawi, population growth has reduced opportunities for farmers to expand and cultivate new land. The country's primary farming population is comprised of smallholders, many who cultivate monocultures of maize (Zea mays). To reduce negative outcomes from this practice, intercropping maize with legumes has been promoted. The sustainable intensification (SI) practice was once widely used, but has declined in recent decades. Little is known about the determinants of intercropping or its role in agricultural development. The objective of this study was to examine the drivers of intercropping among smallholders. We used multiple logistic regression analysis to estimate the determinants of intercropping based on a survey of 324 households. Smallholders who sold legumes were more likely to intercrop, contrary to literature positing intercropping as a practice primarily intended to enhance food security. In addition, complementary SI practices such as fertilizer, manure and compost application were more likely to have occurred on intercropped fields relative to sole maize fields. Furthermore, smallholder farmers appeared to apply more fertilizer to their intercropped fields relative to their sole maize fields. The study highlights the value of including field-level characteristics and household socioeconomic survey data to understand farming practices as a means to inform agricultural policy.Abbreviations: SI: sustainable intensification; MLI: maize-legume intercrop; DL: doubled-up legumes"	"[Silberg, Timothy R.; Richardson, Robert B.; Hockett, Michele; Snapp, Sieglinde S.] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA"		Silberg, TR (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.	silbergt@msu.edu	Snapp, Sieglinde/AAU-8121-2020	"Snapp, Sieglinde/0000-0002-9738-0649; Richardson, Robert/0000-0001-7113-3896; Silberg, Timothy/0000-0002-6948-1573"	United States Agency for International Development [Prime AID-BFS-G11-00002]	United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID))	This work was supported by United States Agency for International Development [grant number Prime AID-BFS-G11-00002].		88	16	16	2	22	TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	ABINGDON	2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND	1473-5903	1747-762X		INT J AGR SUSTAIN	Int.

Three crop arrangements were studied: maize monoculture, soybean monoculture and maize-soybean intercropping. The experimental design was completely randomized with 5 replicates per treatment. Maize-soybean intercropping decreased the dry matter (DM) and grain yield as well as the production of digestible dry matter per hectare. The crude protein content of maize-soybean intercropped silage was higher compared with maize in monoculture (by 40%), but, on average, both silages presented similar fermentation profile, in vitro digestibility (600 g/kg DM), dry matter loss (37.1 g/kg DM), gas loss (36 g/kg DM) and aerobic stability (60 hr). Soybean-crop silage presented an elevated content of volatile organic compounds, low lactic acid concentration (2 g/kg DM), high pH (5.26), and greater losses of dry matter (73 g/kg DM) and gas (98.5 g/kg DM) during fermentation. Aerobic stability was higher in soybean-crop silage (192 hr) due to the high content of volatile fatty acids (butyric acid > 87 g/kg DM) and low contents of residual sugar and lactic acid. In conclusion, maize and soybean intercropping increased crude protein content, but contrary to our hypothesis, the crop association did not result in greater silage digestibility or higher aerobic stability, nonetheless reduced both crop productivity. Additionally, ensiling direct-cut soybean crop with low DM content is not recommended due to the high risk of undesirable fermentation and nutrient losses.

This work aimed to evaluate the use of gliricidia intercropped with maize as a method of weed control in maize (hybrid AG 1051). The experiment was carried out in a randomized complete block design with eight replications. The treatments consisted of: maize cropping with hand-hoeing weed control (at 20 and 40 days after sowing); no weed control; and intercropping with gliricidia. Gliricidia was sown in-rows using 25 seeds m(-2) after maize sowing. Fifteen weed species were found and classified in the experimental area, with the most frequent one being Commelina benghalensis. Green ear yield (with husk and without husk) obtained with intercropping was equal to, or greater than 85% of the yields obtained with weeding. In addition, the grain yield from intercropping reached 80% of grain yield of the corn weeded. Therefore, intercropping maize-gliricidia may be a viable alternative for the production of green corn and grain, although it did not influence the density and dry biomass of the weeds."

The effects of the movement of these herbicides in the soil and in maize plants was measured on Striga germination and on legumes intercropped with maize. Striga seeds were killed when high rates of either herbicide percolated through simulated soil columns; almost no viable Striga seeds remained in the upper 10 cm, and >80% were killed at 30 cm. The herbicides applied to maize leaf whorls moved systemically out of roots, killing attached and germinating Striga. Sensitive crops (beans, cowpea, and yellow gram) were unaffected when planted at >15 cm. from maize coated with 0.4 mg a.i. pyrithiobac or 0.84 mg a.i. imazapyr seed(-1), but were severely inhibited when planted within 12 cm. Simple herbicide seed coatings are thus compatible with commonly used African intercropping systems, while facilitating maize growth and depleting the Striga seed bank.

Intercropping is one of the agricultural practices that can lead to greater crop yields. However, there exists leaf redundancy for maize in intercropping systems, and the top canopy leaves shade more competent leaves at middle strata of maize plants. Therefore, this work aimed to elucidate the effect of leaf excision treatments in maize to understand the optimum leaf area of maize plants under a maize-soybean relay-intercropping system (MSR) and a sole cropping system (SM). The effects of four-leaf excision treatments (T-1, 0; T-2, 2; T-3, 4; T-4, 6 leaves excised from the top of maize plants until 7 days after silking) on light interception, leaf area index (LAI), photosynthetic characteristics, total biomass accumulation at blistering stage (BS), dough stage (DS) and physiological maturity (PM), and seed yield of maize were investigated through field experiments for 2 years under MSR and SM. Results showed that, under MSR and SM, as compared to control (T-1), optimum excision of leaves (T-2) from the top of maize plants significantly improved the light interception (by 25, 18 and 16% at BS, DS and PM, respectively) to lower strata leaves and accelerated the biomass partitioning to maize seeds (by 13 and 12% at DS and PM, respectively). Importantly, plants under T-2 exhibited higher green leaf area than control, that is, excision the top two leaves led to an increase in LAI at PM by 10%, suggesting that leaf senescence under T-2 was delayed which enhanced the photosynthetic rate at PM by 7% in 2017 and 6% in 2018. Relative to T-1, maize under T-2 produced 19 and 13% higher maize yield under MSR and SM, respectively, and relay-cropped maize had 90% of SM seed yield. These results suggest that by manipulating the canopy structure of maize plants we can enhance the biomass accumulation and seed yield of maize crops under MSR and SM."

The soil was classified as a Eutric Cambisol. Four treatments were compared: (i)sole crop maize (Zea mays L.) (SM); (ii) sole crop soybean [Glycine max (L.)

Observed fraction of radiation intercepted (F), radiation use efficiency (RUE), and harvest index (HI) revealed that PAR transmittance at the bottom of the soybean canopy adjacent to the maize was higher than that farther from the maize. However, this difference decreased as the crops developed. The averaged extinction coefficient (K) and RUE were 0.51 and 2.82 g MJ(-1) for I-1 and 0.50 and 2.78 g MJ(-1) for I-2, respectively, compared with 0.46 and 3.18 g MJ(-1) for sole crop maize and 0.59 and 1.55 g MJ(-1) for sole crop soybean. The HI of I-1 and I-2 were 0.45 and 0.44 for maize and 0.35 and 0.36 for soybean, respectively. The HI of sole crop maize and sole crop soybean were 0.42 and 0.40, respectively. The mean land equivalent ratio (LER) for I-1 and I-2 was 1.65 and 1.71, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that intercropping usually had greater RUE than sole cropping, which may account for the yield advantage of intercropping."

Pioneer 6872) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv. Rio Tibagi) in a row intercropping system was conducted in Chapeeo, SC, Brazil, to determine the best agronomic combinations and the economically most efficient intercropping system. Five experiments were carried out annually and consisted of five maize planting dates in relation to bean, with four spatial arrangements for each planting date. The experimental design was randomized complete blocks with four replications of each treatment. Maize was planted 15 days before bean, simultaneously to bean, and 15, 30 and 45 days after bean planting. The spatial arrangements were 1M:1B (one maize row alternated with one bean row), 2M:2B, 2M:3B and 1M:2B. Planting dates and spatial arrangements influenced the yields of maize and common bean. The most efficient spatial arrangements for maize were 1M: 1B and 2M:2B and for common bean were 1M:2B and 2M:3B. Early planting of common bean by 15 days over maize increased its yield by 35% while the maize yield was reduced by 7.5%. Agronomic and economic efficiency of row intercropping over sole cropping increased with common bean early planting.

Changes in the content of above- and below-ground biomass, leaf photosynthetic rate (Pn), leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll meter reading (SPAD), diffuse non interceptance (DIFN), soil water storage (SWS), crop nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) uptake were examined in a 2-year trial of different maize-soybean intercropping systems on the Loess Plateau, China. Compared with the sole cropping system, shoot biomass of maize was increased by 54% in M2S2 and 62% in M2S4 strip intercropping treatment. The crop N and P uptake of maize increased significantly, by 54% and 50% in M2S2 and by 63% and 52% in M2S4 compared with their respective sole crop. LAI values of maize in intercropping systems were 14% and 15% for M2S2 and M2S4 less than that in the sole crop. The DIFN of intercropped maize was increased by 41% and 48% for M2S2 and M2S4 compared to monocrop. There were no significant differences in Pn and SWS in both crops between the two cropping systems. The contribution rate of DIFN in M2S2 and crop P uptake in M2S4 on the biological yield in intercropping system was the highest among all factors. We conclude that the sowing proportion affects above- and below-ground competition in maize-soybean intercropping systems.

However, the extent of miscanthus cultivation across Europe is still lagging far behind its real potential. Major limiting factors are high initial costs and low biomass yields in the crop establishment period, especially the first year. This study explores the possibility of establishing miscanthus under maize to generate yields from the first year of cultivation onwards. A field trial with mono-cropped maize and two miscanthus establishment procedures, under maize' (MUM) and standard' (REF), was established in southwest Germany in 2016. Annual aboveground biomass was harvested in autumn (2016-2018). In 2016 and 2017, the miscanthus dry matter yield (DMY) was significantly lower in MUM than REF. However, the accumulated DMY of miscanthus and maize was as high in MUM as in maize cultivation alone. In 2018, there was no significant difference between the miscanthus DMY of REF (7.86 +/- 0.77 Mg ha(-1)) and MUM (6.21 +/- 0.77 Mg ha(-1)). The accumulated DMY over the three years was 31.7 Mg ha(-1) for MUM, of which 10.1 Mg ha(-1) were miscanthus-based, compared to 17.7 Mg ha(-1) for REF. These results indicate that miscanthus establishment under maize could compensate for its lack of yield in the first year.

The main fanning system of the majority of the farmers (98%) was based on intercropping involving maize, beans and pumpkin combined in an haphazard fashion. Based on the above findings, two field experiments were set up in 1998 designed to bring out the best planting combinations for maize/beans and maize/pumpkin intercrops which could be introduced to the farmers. Effect of weeding on the intercrops was also investigated. In both intercrops, intercropping adversely affected the plant heights and circumferences of the component crops. Also, the yield of the individual crop in each intercrop was depressed by intercropping compared with its sole yield. In maize/beans intercrop, the yield of maize was depressed by 15% and that of beans by 13%. However in both intercrops, productivity as measured by Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) was the highest with maize at 10000 plants/ha combined with beans at 150000 plants/ha (2.60) with weeding while the combination with the best LER (1,50) in maize/pumpkin intercrop was at 30000 plants/ha of maize combined with pumpkin at 2500 plants/ha, with weeding. However, before any final recommendation is made, the profitability of each combination has to be considered. Weeding was found to enhance intercrop yields in maize/bean combination by 35% and by 30% in maize/pumpkin combination.

The results revealed that higher productivity per unit area and unit time could be obtained when maize was intercropped with cowpea, the latter being retained for seed and fodder. In late rabi when maize was raised as a contingent crop (in situation where sufficient water is not available to raise rice), scheduling of irrigation at four stages (5 leaf, late knee high, silking and dough stages) recorded yield at par with irrigation given at six stages (5 leaf, early knee high, late knee high, tasselling, silking and dough stages). Further, irrespective of the total number of irrigations, whenever irrigation was skipped at silking, a greater reduction in yield was noticed, compared to missing irrigation at any other stage. Water absorbing polymer (Jalsakhti) did not show any positive response on the grain yield of maize.

Maize Growth with Weed Control via Intercropping with Gliricidia	PLANTA DANINHA			Portuguese	Article						"Zea mays; Gliricidia sepium; green corn; grain yield"	"ZEA-MAYS L.; COMPETITION; ALLOCATION; TREES"	"The maize/gliricidia intercropping is known to control weeds. The aim of this work was to carry out a growth analysis of maize intercropped with gliricidia, to better evaluate the weed control. The double-hybrid AG 1051 was used and the crop was managed with three weed control procedures: (a) no-weeding; (b) two manual-weedings (at 20 and 40 days after seeding); and (c) maize intercropped with gliricidia, whose seeds were evenly spread by hand between maize rows just after maize sowing, using 25 seeds m(-2). The experiment was a randomized complete block design, arranged in split-plots with eight replications. Weed control was applied to the plots, with the subplots consisting of ten plant samplings to evaluate leaf area and shoot dry matter yield. Maize shoot samplings were collected every seven days, 14 days after sowing. The control of weeds with two weedings resulted in higher values in area and leaf dry matter, as well as in total plant dry matter. Regarding these traits, the plants of the intercropped plots showed intermediate behavior between plants of weeded plots and plants of non-weeded plots. Therefore, weeds reduce the growth of maize while gliricidia probably partially controls the weeds, benefiting maize. There were no differences between treatments for weed control regarding absolute growth rates and relative growth rates, specific leaf area, and net assimilation rate. The highest leaf area ratio of maize was observed with gliricidia intercropping."	"[Araujo Jr, B. B.] Inst Fed Educ Ciencia & Tecnol Rio Grande do Nort, BR-59508000 Ipanguacu, RN, Brazil; [Silva, P.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of interspecific interactions on forage yield and the influence of P application on interspecific competitiveness and yield in a fully-mixed intercropping system of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia Scop.), orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.). A three-year (2016-2018) field experiment was conducted in central China with an annual rainfall and temperature of 456 mm and 9.5 degrees C, respectively. Five legume and grass seeding ratios (L: G) of 5:5, 4:6, 3:7, 6:4, and 7:3 were included, with four monocultures used as the control. The total forage yield was measured when 20% of the alfalfa flowers had opened (BBCH 62). Competitiveness indices, including the land equivalent ratio (LER), aggressivity (A), relative crowding coefficient (K values), competitive ratio (CR), and actual yield loss (AYL), were assessed. The total forage yield increased under fully-mixed intercropping in 2017-2018 when a transgressive overyielding advantage was attained, which was contributed by the interspecific interactions and P application. Moreover, the maximum yield and highest intercropping advantage appeared in L: G 3:7 and L: G 5:5 under 80 kg ha(-1) P application in 2017-2018. Additionally, adequate P (80 kg ha(-1)) contributed to higher A values, K values, CR, and AYL of alfalfa and orchardgrass than in sainfoin and tall fescue, which suggested greater interspecific benefits and land-use efficiency. The fully-mixed intercropping system of alfalfa, sainfoin, orchardgrass, and tall fescue realized these potential advantages by coordinating interspecific interactions and environmental resources, which were manipulated by P application.

The grain yield of maize in both the years was the highest in paired sowing (sole), but the total grain equivalent of maize was highest in paired-sown maize + French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in ratio of 1 : 2. This treatment also gave the highest net return (Rs 10,032/ha) and monetary advantage (Rs 11,941/ha), followed by paired-sown maize + lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus) in ratio of 1 : 3. The latter treatment, however, had the highest land-equivalent ratio (1.77) and benefit : cost ratio (2.37). The seed yields of French bean, wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend.

In Kenya, cowpea Vigna unguiculata (Walp.) is grown in combination with cereals such as maize and sorghum, perennial legumes such as pigeon peas and root crops such as cassava and sweet potatoes. In the present investigations, field experiments were conducted to study the incidence and damage caused by Clavigralla tomentoscollis Germ. and C. shadabi, after flowering, on cowpea intercropped with maize. It was evident from the present studies that C. tomentoscollis and C. shadabi were more prevalent on cowpea during the first season rather than during the second season. Both species had a preference for feeding on cowpea intercropped with maize than when it was grown in pure stands. Consequently more pod damage was recorded on cowpea planted with maize. It was therefore concluded that this agricultural system, which is commonly practised by small-scale farmers in Kenya, is undesirable from the point of view of bug damage.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate in soybean seeding the operational performance of tractor-seeder on maize straws intercropped with Urochloas in different treatments. The study was conducted in a randomized block design in factorial scheme 2 x 4 + 1, with four replications, formed by two intercropped forage species and five cropping systems. The dry maize straw, Urochloas dry mass and total straw dry mass were determined in treatments to verify the operational performance of the machines. The results showed that the amount of straw produced by maize and Urochloas interferes with the slippage of the tractor's front wheels, i.e., areas with higher amount of straw promotes lower adherence of the wheel. Energy demand was not affected by amount of straw produced by the treatments, as well as fuel consumption and operational field capacity.

Hence, the present study examined the effect of white lupine (Lupinus albusL.) on mycorrhizal symbiosis of neighboring maize (Zea maysL.) along with plant growth and rhizosphere P fractions. A pot experiment was conducted with Regosol soil for 42 days. Two P treatments used in the study were 0P (no P addition) and 100P (100 mg P kg(-1)soil supplied by NaH2PO4 center dot 2H(2)O). Plant growth, rhizosphere P fractions, P acquisition, and mycorrhizal infection of maize roots were investigated. When maize was grown with white lupine, shoot P concentration and dry weight of maize in 0P were enhanced by 41% and 22%, respectively, compared with that in sole cropping. Application of the high dosage of soluble P (100P) eliminated those complementary effects with a substantial reduction in mycorrhizal infection of maize. Non-mycorrhizal white lupine did not strongly influence the mycorrhizal infection of maize root. Complementarity of two distinct P acquisition strategies (acquisition of mobilized P by root exudates and P uptake through mycorrhizal hyphae) promoted the growth and P uptake of maize plant during the early stage of growth in the intercropping system with P-efficient white lupine. Maize was able to get the additive P benefits from its own mycorrhizal colonization and P-mobilizing strategy of companion white lupine only under P-limited conditions. The results of this experiment could be useful in designing P-efficient cropping systems with compatible crop combinations for P-limited lands.	"[Dissanayaka, D. M. S.

[Merr.]), but intense management practices have led to soil degradation and amplified greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. This paper presents preliminary data on the effect of maize-soybean intercrops compared with maize and soybean sole crops on the short-term emission rates of CO2 and N2O and its relationship to soil moisture or temperature over two field seasons. Soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations were significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the maize sole crop and intercrops, whereas soil bulk density was significantly lower in the intercrops. Soil CO2 emission rates were significantly greater in the maize sole crop but did not differ significantly for N2O emissions. Over two field seasons, both trace gases showed a general trend of greater emission rates in the maize sole crop followed by the soybean sole crop and were lowest in the intercrops. Linear regression between soil GHG (CO2 and N2O) emission rates and soil temperature or volumetric soil moisture were not significant except in the 1:2 intercrop where a significant relationship was observed between N2O emissions and soil temperature in the first field season and between N2O and volumetric soil moisture in the second field season. Our results demonstrated that intercropping in the Argentine Pampa may be a more sustainable agroecosystem land-management practice with respect to GHG emissions.

Soil loss was considered variable between plots due to differences in surface soil, land cover, infrastructure (trash lines, grass strips, and Fanya-juu), crop management, slope, and map unit. The eroding clods indicator proved of little significance because the initial clods cover was unknown; the indicator probably relates better to soil erodibility then to soil loss. Flow surfaces, formed during erosive showers, were less present on fields with a higher ground and canopy cover, if the area of eroding clods was high, and if the topsoil had no loam which reduces chances of sealing; no impact of infrastructure, tillage, and weeding were detected. Fewer pre-rills were present where the fraction of groundcover was high, where Pigeon Peas were not grown (they cause micro-relief and concentrated flows), where weeding ended late (time effect), where more flow surfaces occurred, where Fanya-juu was constructed (less steep slopes), where the top-soil contained little sand (less sediment entrainment), and where maize was intercropped with vegetables (positive canopy cover effects). The model was not map unit specific and had an Adjusted R-2 of 67%. The log-linear relationship indicates that combined positive conditions exponentially reduce the occurrence of pre-rills. The pre-rill indicator related best to management-affected site conditions and seems to reflect best the cumulative effects of soil loss over time. Rills were found at 18 sites located in drier areas on sandy-clay soils. The model suggested more rills if the topsoil contains no silt; this makes the soil susceptible to compaction, peptisation when wet, and rill formation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

J	Fininsa, C				Fininsa, C			Relationship between common bacterial blight severity and bean yield loss in pure stand and bean-maize intercropping systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEST MANAGEMENT			English	Article						"common bacterial blight; Phaseolus vulgaris; yield loss; intercropping"	"MODELING CROP LOSSES; RUST; ETHIOPIA; DISEASES"	Field experiments were conducted in the 1999 and 2000 seasons to determine the relationship between common bacterial blight (CBB) ( caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli) and bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris) yield in different cropping systems. Different levels of disease severity were created using natural epidemics by spraying copper hydroxide ( Kocide 101) at 7-, 14- and 21-day intervals beginning at the first observation of CBB symptoms. The susceptible cultivar Red Wolaita was grown in broadcast, mixed and row bean - maize intercropping and pure stand. The bean growth stage at which the disease severity was correlated with seed yield varied among the cropping systems. In broadcast and mixed intercroppings, CBB appeared to be correlated with seed yield at later growth stages. In row intercropping, disease was correlated at preflowering to 50% flowering and in pure stand at 50% flowering to pod filling. In intercropping systems, both relative and predicted seed yield and 100-seed weight losses to CBB were, generally, less than in pure stand. Single-point regression models in 1999 predicted that for each per cent increase of CBB severity in broadcast and mixed intercropping, about 5.2 and 9.1 kg ha(1) seed yield loss, respectively, occurred at physiological maturity. In pure stand, for each percentage increase in CBB at an earlier growth stage, 73 days after planting (DAP) in 2000, a yield loss of 38.8 kg ha(1) occurred. Similarly, in row intercropping a 71.1 kg ha(1), seed yield loss was estimated at 52 DAP in 1999. Decreasing seed weight was correlated with yield loss to CBB. The type of cropping system influenced CBB severity and the amount of loss in yield attributable to CBB. Variation in CBB and its relation to yield between years was influenced by difference in seasonal weather between years.

Fall/winter (March-August) maize cropping systems, sole or intercropped with U. ruziziensis, were associated with four nitrogen (N) rates (0, 40, 80, and 120 kg ha(-1) N) applied as ammonium nitrate (30% N). The soil chemical attributes were not influenced by the factors studied. The N rates linearly increased phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), and copper (Cu) concentrations in maize leaves by 29, 30, and 49%, respectively, whereas for soybeans, only the concentration of manganese was raised by 15%. Maize leaf calcium was linearly reduced with N rates only when sole cropped, up to 15%. The cropping systems did not influence nutrient concentrations in soybean leaves; however, maize leaf concentrations of P within 80 and 120 kg ha(-1) of N, as well as potassium, S, and Cu at all N rates, were reduced in 9, 6.5, 6.5, and 8%, respectively."

The off-season maize intercropped with ruzigrass [Urochloa ruziziensis (R. Germ. & C.M. Evrard) Crins (Syn. Brachiaria ruziziensis Germ. & Evrard)] increases soil cover and yield for crops in succession. However, the benefits on maize yield depend on the distribution and radiation-use efficiency (RUE) and its conversion to biomass. This study aimed to evaluate maize and ruzigrass yield in different cultivation systems. The experiment was carried out at Embrapa Agropecuaria Oeste, in Dourados, MS, Brazil. The experiment design was randomized blocks, with seven treatments constituted by the combination of spacing between maize rows, single and intercropped, with ruzigrass in distribution methods. Photosynthetically active radiation, chlorophyll, leaf temperature, morphological characteristics and maize mass yield were evaluated in maize at the flowering stage (R1). Maize and ruzigrass yield were evaluated during maize maturation. The reduced spacing in single maize has a higher yield and lower radiation incidence in the ear. Maize intercropped with ruzigrass sown by broadcasting showed higher leaf temperature, lower plant height and lower maize leaf area. Morphological and physiological characteristics and maize grain yield were more influenced by planting methods than the presence of ruzigrass. The highest yield of dry matter and maize grain occurred in reduced spacing in maize, either alone or intercropped with ruzigrass.

'H 405' maize, 'JS 72-44' soybean [Glycine max(L.) Merr.], 'T9' blackgram (Phaseolus mungo L.) and 'ICPL 87' pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] were tested in a monoculture and intercropping systems with 3 ratios (2:2, 2:4 and 4:2). Maize + soybean was better than maize + blackgram combination for yield and competitive parameters. No significant difference was observed among maize + soybean ratios of 2:2, 2:4 and 4:2 for seed yield, biomass yield, maize-equivalent yield and land-equivalent ratio, but 2:2 ratio gave comparatively better monetary advantage than 4:2 ratio. Similar trend was observed for all maize + pigeonpea in 2:2 ratio gave better intercrop yield, biomass yield, maize-equivalent and monetary advantage than 4:2 ratio. Maximum competitive ratio of 1.764 for maize was observed in maize + pigeonpea in 2:4 ratio. Highest maize-equivalent yield of 6.115 tonnes/ha was recorded by pigeonpea, followed by soybean (5.453) and blackgram (3.341) compared with 3.220 tonnes/ha by maize. Maize was dominant to soybean and blackgram, whereas pigeonpea was dominant to maize in different cropping systems. In Vertisol maize + pigeonpea in 2:2 ratio was more advantageous, as reflected by different yield, monetary advantage and competitive parameters, except maize-equivalent yield which was at par with sole pigeonpea crop.

A 2-year field experiment was carried out during 2012 and 2013 to evaluate the effects of different strip width treatments on dry-matter production, major-nutrient (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) uptake, and competition parameters of soybean and maize in relay intercropping system. The strip width (SW) treatments were 0.40, 0.40, and 0.40 m (SW1); 0.40, 0.40, and 0.50 m (SW2); 0.40, 0.40, and 0.60 m (SW3); and 0.40, 0.40, and 0.70 m (SW4) for soybean row spacing, maize row spacing, and spacing between soybean and maize rows, respectively. As compared to sole maize (SM) and sole soybean (SS), relay-intercropped maize and soybean accumulated lower quantities of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in all treatments. However, maize in SW1 accumulated higher nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium than SW4 (9%, 9%, and 8% for nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, respectively). Soybean in SW3 accumulated 25% higher nitrogen, 33% higher phosphorus, and 24% higher potassium than in SW1. The improved nutrient accumulation in SW3 significantly increased the soybean dry matter by 19%, but slightly decreased the maize dry matter by 6% compared to SW1. Similarly, SW3 increased the competition ratio value of soybean (by 151%), but it reduced the competition ratio value of maize (by 171%) compared to SW1. On average, in SW3, relay-cropped soybean produced 84% of SS seed yield and maize produced 98% of SM seed yield and achieved the land equivalent ratio of 1.8, demonstrating the highest level in the world. Overall, these results suggested that by selecting the appropriate strip width (SW3; 0.40 m for soybean row spacing, 0.40 m maize row spacing, and 0.60 m spacing between soybean and maize rows), we can increase the nutrient uptake (especially nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium), dry-matter accumulation, and seed yields of relay-intercrop species under relay intercropping systems."

Grain yields in both monocropping and intercropping were significantly different (P<0.01) with plant density. There was an advantage in intercropping over monocropping as the LER was above 1.0 in all three densities with the medium density having the highest LER. Similar results were found using Total Nutrient Content (TNC). There were significant differences in dietary nutrient content (P<0.01) between intercropping and monocropping.

The dry matter yields of maize and mungbean in the mixtures studied and the land equivalent ratio (LER) were at a maximum when the component crops were at their respective sole crop populations of 50 x 10(3) and 300 x 10(3) plants ha(-1), respectively. Component populations of mungbean did not have a significant effect on the gran yield of maize but mungbean yield decreased as the population of either component crop was increased. Nitrogen absorption by both maize and mungbean was lower in intercropping compared with that in the sole crops; the proportional reduction in N absorption efficiency of maize ranged from 0.28 to 0.37 and that of mungbean from 0.50 to 0.57. Increasing the maize ranged from 0.28 to 0.37 and that of mungbean from 0.50 to 0.57. Increasing the maize population caused a reduction in the N absorption efficiency of mungbean although it increased the N absorption efficiency of maize. The N absorption efficiency of maize and mungbean intercropped in all combinations of populations was higher that that of the sole crops added together. This was the major source of the increase in LER over unity. The N conversion efficiency, measured as the unit of grains produced unit(-1) of N absorbed, decreased in intercropped maize but increased slightly in mungbean.

Influence of Simultaneous Intercropping of Maize-Bean with Input of Inorganic or Organic Fertilizer on Growth, Development, and Dry Matter Partitioning to Yield Components of Two Lines of Common Bean	AGRONOMY-BASEL			English	Article						"maize; common bean; intercropping pattern; monoculture; cob growth; pod growth; response to fertilizer; agronomic performance"	"FOOD SECURITY; 9 BILLION; CROP; EFFICIENCY; QUALITY; LIGHT; CONFIGURATION; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; TRAITS"	Intercropping is a common practice among smallholder farmers cultivating common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and maize (Zea mays L.). It affects agronomic performance, dry matter partitioning, and grain yield. Simultaneous intercropping of common bean with maize can influence growth, development, and dry matter partitioning of grain of common bean. The main objectives of this study are to: (i) evaluate the dynamics of growth and development of the different vegetative organs, and (ii) determine the efficiency in dry matter partitioning to yield components of two common bean lines grown under monoculture compared with two simultaneous intercropping patterns (pattern 1, pattern 2) with maize and managed with two types of fertilizer application. A randomized complete block design (RCBD) with 3 replications was used in a nested trifactorial arrangement in split-plot scheme. The field experiment was conducted in two seasons under conditions of acid soils and high temperatures in the western Amazon region of Colombia. Simultaneous intercropping patterns 1 and 2 had a negative effect on growth dynamics of maize compared to maize monoculture. But the two bean lines when associated with maize showed no significant differences on growth dynamics under both types of fertilizer application. Under both intercropping patterns, the maize cobs were larger, a condition that increased the number of grains, but with smaller size of grains compared to monoculture. In the case of two bean lines, the growth and development responses were different: under monoculture the number of pods and seeds per plant was higher while the number of grains per pod increased under intercropping patterns. Among the two bean lines, 100-seed weight was significantly higher in BFS 10 compared to ALB 121. At the grain yield level of common bean, the simultaneous intercropping pattern increased 516 kg ha(-1) and 993 kg ha(-1) more than that obtained in monoculture (4936 kg ha(-1)) with inorganic and organic fertilizer, respectively. Results from this study indicated that smallholders in the Amazon region of Colombia can achieve higher grain yield through the implementation of simultaneous intercropping of maize with common bean line (BFS 10) under organic fertilizer application.

In this study, a field experiment was carried out during 2012 and 2013 growing seasons to examine water use and crop coefficient of this system in an arid environment. The experiment comprised three treatments: sole-cropped wheat, sole-cropped maize, and wheat-maize intercropping. The grain yields of both intercropped wheat and maize were enhanced by intercropping. The gross economic profit for wheat-maize intercropping was 16.4% lower than that of sole maize and 95.4% higher than that of sole wheat. The overall land use efficiency was improved by intercropping. The time course of leaf area index in intercropping had the similar trends to those in sole crops with relatively low values, which never exceeded 3.0 m(2) m(-2) throughout both growing seasons. Compared to weighted means of the sole-cropping systems, wheat-maize intercropping used 26% and 24% more water in 2012 and 2013, respectively. The water-use efficiency of intercropping was nearly the same as the weighted means of the sole crops. Due to the incomplete groundcover in intercropping plots, more water was consumed as soil evaporation. Averaged over two seasons, the ratio of soil evaporation to actual evapotranspiration was 33.4, 20.7 and 24.1% for intercropping system, sole-cropped wheat and sole-cropped maize, respectively. Crop coefficient (KC) of sole-cropped wheat was 0.19 +/- 0.02, 1.05 +/- 0.07, and 0.42 +/- 0.09 at the initial, mid and late season in two seasons, respectively. K-c value of the sole-cropped maize was 0.22 +/- 0.03, 1.10 +/- 0.06 and 0.60 +/- 0.02 at the initial, mid and late season, respectively. The Kc values of the wheat-maize intercropping system varied in 0.21 +/- 0.03, 0.89 +/- 0.05, and 0.78 +/- 0.06 at the initial, middle and late wheat growing season, and in 0.85 +/- 0.03 and 0.61 +/- 0.01 at the middle and late maize growing season, respectively. Therefore, longer growing season and incomplete ground cover are the main factors that resulted in higher water use for wheat-maize intercropping compared to sole crops. Results of this study can help to improve the irrigation efficiency for the wheat-maize strip intercropping system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, little is known about whether changes in planting geometry improve the seasonal water use of maize and soybean intercrops. We conducted two different field experiments in 2013 and 2014 to investigate the effects of changes in planting geometry on water use efficiency (WUE) and evapotranspiration (ETc) of maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] relay strip intercrop systems. Our results showed that the leaf area index of maize for both years where intercropping occurred was notably greater compared to sole maize, thus the soil water content (SWC), soil evaporation (E), and throughfall followed a decreasing trend in the following order: central row of maize strip (CRM) < adjacent row between maize and soybean strip (AR) < central row of soybean strip (CRS). When intercropped, the highest grain yield for maize and total yields were recorded for the 40: 120 cm and 40: 160 cm planting geometries using 160 cm and 200 cm bandwidth, respectively. By contrast, the highest grain yield of intercropped soybean was appeared for the 20: 140 cm and 20: 180 cm planting geometries. The largest land equivalent ratios were 1.62 for the 40: 120 cm planting geometry and 1.79 for the 40: 160 cm planting geometry, indicating that both intercropping strategies were advantageous. Changes in planting geometries did not show any significant effect on the ETc of the maize and soybean intercrops. WUEs in the different planting geometries of intercrop systems were lower compared to sole cropping. However, the highest group WUEs of 23.06 and 26.21 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) for the 40: 120 cm and 40: 160 cm planting geometries, respectively, were 39% and 23% higher than those for sole cropping. Moreover, the highest water equivalent ratio values of 1.66 and 1.76 also appeared for the 40: 120 cm and 40: 160 cm planting geometries. We therefore suggest that an optimum planting geometry of 40: 160 cm and bandwidth of 200 cm could be a viable planting pattern management method for attaining high group WUE in maize-soybean intercrop systems.

Maize-based (Zea mays) sustainable cropping systems have recently been developed as water-saving and low carbon cropping systems compared to traditional maize-wheat (Triticum aestivum) cropping. To examine carbon emission of different cropping systems, five maize-based cropping systems were investigated from 2015 to 2017 in this study, which included intercropping of maize and soybean (Glycine max) (MS), relay intercropping of maize with pea (Pisum sativum) (MP) and potato (Solanum tuberosum) (MO), and rotation of maize with ryegrass (Secale cereale) (MR) and spinach (Spinacia oleracea) (MI), with monocropped maize (MM) as the control. Carbon emission of each cropping system per unit area, per kg biomass, and per unit economic output was calculated based on the experimental results, which considered direct emissions of soil greenhouse gas and indirect emissions of agricultural inputs. Results revealed the carbon emission unit area of monocropped maize was 19380.67 kg CO2-eq/ha, and maize-based cropping systems increased by 11%-34% compared to MM, except MS which decreased by 38%. While, the carbon emission per kg biomass and per economic output of the five maize-based cropping systems were decreased by 7%-24% and 18%-61% compared to those of MM (1.04 kg CO2-eq/kg and 8.04 kg CO2/$). The cropping systems showed the order of MS < MI < MR < MO < MP < MM and MI < MO < MR < MP < MS < MM sorted by their annual carbon emission calculated per kg biomass and per economic output, respectively. The direct greenhouse gas emissions from soil were responsible for 76-85% of total carbon emission, which were mostly emitted in the growing period. Results showed that maize-based cropping systems could contribute to cleaner production in terms of biomass and economic output in the North China Plain. These indicate that suitable cropping system can achieve low carbon emission without compromising economic benefits compared to monocropped maize. Intercropping of maize and soybean, relay cropping of maize with potato are recommended in the North China Plain in this study among the treatments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Interspecific competition and complementarity with respect to root plasticity is essential knowledge for understanding the mechanisms of overyielding and optimizing intercropping species selection. We conducted a threeyear field experiment (2017-2019) to quantify land and water productivities in relation to above- and belowground interspecific interactions, root growth and distribution under different nitrogen rates in maize/soybean intercropping. The land productivity in terms of land equivalent ratio (LER) in maize/soybean intercropping was 1.10 across all years and N rates. The yield increase in intercropped maize was mainly gained from an 45% increase in kernel numbers, while the yield loss of intercropped soybean was caused mainly by an 35% decrease in the pod numbers compared to sole cropping. The system level water use efficiency, defined as water equivalent ratio (WER) was also 1.10. Compared with sole stands, intercropped maize consumed more water during the vegetative stage, but intercropped soybean took up more during the reproductive stage. That indicated a temporal complementarity of water use in the intercrop, which benefited maize kernel formation and partially offset the negative shading effect of soybean grain filling. Soybean showed a marked increase in root length density (RLD). Compared to the produced aboveground biomass (DM) in the intercrop, the intercropped soybean invested more assimilates into root than shoot, as defined as root plasticity, the RLD/DM ratio of soybean in the intercrop was 76% more than sole system. However, the intercrop did not change root plasticity of maize. The overlap of maize and soybean roots, i.e. interspecific interaction interface, occurred mainly within the position between two border rows and at first soybean row. Under interspecific competition, soybean in the intercropping created both temporal and spatial differentiation for water uptake, which might be a key reason for enhancing intercropping land and water productivities. Our results contribute to understanding the mechanism of interspecific interaction for maximizing land and water productivities in rain-fed intercropping.

In order to meet this interest, two monocrops of cowpea (the traditional varieties, Corujinha and Sempre Verde) were evaluated with two monocrops of maize (the AG 1051 double hybrid and the AL Bandeirante variety) and four intercrops (combinations of the cowpea varieties and the maize cultivars). Under the intercropping systems, the maize and cowpea occupied alternating rows. A completely randomized block design with six replications was used. Grain growth and yield were higher in the AG 1051 hybrid than in the AL Bandeirante variety in both the monocropped and intercropping systems. For medium-sized maize grain, the growth and yield were higher in the monocrops than in the intercrops. It is unimportant which variety of cowpea, Corujinha or Sempre Verde, is used with each maize cultivar in the intercropping systems, as there was no interaction between the maize cultivars and the cowpea cultivars. In the monocropped systems, the grain yield of the Corujinha cultivar was greater than that of the Sempre Verde cultivar. Mean grain yield in the monocrops was greater than in the intercrops. Both cowpea cultivars showed better performance when intercropped with the AL Bandeirante maize cultivar than with the AG 1051 cultivar. The value of the land equivalent ratio was greater than 1.0 only for the combination of the AL Bandeirante variety of maize and the Sempre Verde variety of cowpea.

Cereal/legume intercropping is a potential pathway to lower fertilizer inputs, but there is insufficient knowledge on the nitrogen (N) response in species mixtures. Here, we investigated N response in maize/peanut intercropping. Maize showed a stronger yield response to N input than peanut both in sole cropping and in intercropping, and so did sole crops relative to intercrops. Maize yield was the highest at the maximum level tested: 360 kg N/ha. Agronomic efficiency (AE) of sole maize was 7.8 kg/kg N input, averaged across five N levels (0, 90, 180, 270, and 360 kg/ha). Partial land equivalent ratios (pLERs) for maize decreased with N input, from 0.70 at zero to 0.64 at 360 kg/ha. Sole peanut showed an optimum yield response to N input, with the highest yield at 270 kg/ha and lower yield at 360 kg/ha. The average AE of sole peanut was 1.3 kg/kg. The pLER of peanut declined from 0.43 at zero to 0.32 at 360 kg/ha while the overall LER decreased from 1.13 to 0.96, indicating relative better performance of intercropping at low than at high N input. Apparent recovery (RE) for N was 27.2% for sole maize, 12.4% for sole peanut, and 7.2% for intercrops. Mean N uptake was 179 kg/ha in sole maize, 199 kg/ha in intercropping, and 264 kg/ha in sole peanut. Partial economic budgeting indicated that with the current low Chinese N fertilizer prices, gross margin is maximized with high N input in sole crops; however, for intercropping, the highest gross margin was attained at intermediate N inputs of 180 or 270 kg/ha. Fertilizer price incentives may facilitate a transition to intercropping at moderate N input in China."

Marandu) is considered a highly relevant cropping system to deliver both residue and forage. However, the benefits of inclusion of palisadegrass in maize systems and its influence on fertilizer dynamics and nitrogen (N) budget as well as the period after maize harvest for which palisadegrass continues to grow remain unclear. Thus, we conducted field studies to determine crop growth, end-season biomass, N fertilizer recovery, and overall N budget between an intercrop and a monoculture at two different sites during conventional and late-planted maize seasons. The cropping systems evaluated were maize and palisadegrass in monocultures and two intercrop patterns, serving as cover crop or forage with simulated grazing. From planting to grain harvest, intercrop patterns did not affect grain yield, final N content, and N fertilizer dynamics. Post-harvest, palisadegrass from intercrop patterns improved biomass from 1 to 10 Mg ha(-1) and N content from 8 to 300 kg ha(-1), relative to fallow after maize monoculture. Contribution of palisadegrass intercropping on N fertilizer recovery was low at approximately 4.5 kg ha(-1) when both the crops were growing simultaneously and approximately 2.4 kg ha(-1) following maize grain harvest. In three out of four sites over 2 years, intercrop patterns did not affect total N fertilizer recovery compared with their monocultures, averaging at approximately 51 %. Advantages of maize-palisadegrass intercropping on biomass, yield, and N cycling were documented at the site where maize was planted during the conventional season, despite the yearly variation in weather conditions. A negative N budget of -230 kg ha(-1) was estimated when grazing was simulated during the conventional maize planting season, suggesting greater N requirements of the intercropped palisadegrass when serving as forage.

Seed yield of the monocrops of sorghum, maize and soybean were higher than the individual components in the intercrops. Yields of component crops in the intercrop varied significantly with the components population density. The sorghum/soybean intercrops which had LER (Land Equivalent Ratio) up to 1.40 in 1986 and 1.35 in 1987 were more productive than soybean/maize intercrop with maximum LER of 1.28 and 1.34 respectively during 1986 and 1987. Similarly the ATER (Area x Time Equivalent Ratio) of sorghum/soybean was greater than in soybean/maize. However, for maximum productivity of sorghum or maize intercropped with soybean, optimum population of one component crop plus 1/3 optimum population of the companion crop is recommended depending on which of the crop is regarded as main or minor crop.

We applied stability analysis to assess impacts of grain legume integration on maize (Zea mays L.) grain yield, yield stability, N use efficiency (NUE), and ability to meet household protein requirements. Six field trials were conducted across three agroecological zones over five cropping seasons. We used additive main effect and multiplicative interaction to assess grain yield stability of maize in unfertilized maize, maize fertilized with 69 kg N ha(-1) (Mz69), maize-pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] intercrop (MzPp), and maize in rotation with soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] (SbRot), peanut (Arachis hypogaea L., PnRot), and peanut-pigeonpea intercrop (PnDLR). Maize in rotation or intercrop received 10.5 kg P2O5 and 35 kg N ha(-1), whereas the Mz69 treatment received 21 kg P2O5 and 69 kg N ha(-1). Maize grain yield in rotation with legumes was not significantly different from yield for Mz69. In wetter environments, MzPp intercrops had low maize grain yield (similar to 35%) relative to Mz69, whereas in drier environments, maize had higher grain yield (14%) relative to rotated maize. Rotating maize with legumes increased NUE (56%) and protein contributions (65%) relative to Mz69. Grain yield of maize in SbRot consistently had the highest yield and was the most stable technology. Simple statistical models can be used to test multicrop stability. Integrating maize with legumes as intercrops or rotation can allow farmers to achieve high and stable yield under varying rainfall, with modest fertilizer investments."

This affects the uptake of nutrients and distribution patterns in various plant organs of intercrop species in MS. Judicious defoliation of maize plants in MS could help to alleviate this problem and improve nutrient uptake and intercrop yields. In a two-year field experiment with MS, including the measurements of biomass production, nutrients uptake, and distribution at the organ level, and grain yields of intercrop species, maize plants were subjected to four-leaf defoliation treatments to improve the light-transmittance of maize and soybean plants. Defoliation of the topmost two-leaves (T-2), fourleaves (T-4), six-leaves (T-6) was compared to no defoliation (T-0). Compared to T-0, treatment T-2 improved the uptake of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) in each plant part of maize by 23, 12, and 11% (grain), 22, 19, and 13% (straw), and 28, 14, and 18% (root), respectively. Defoliation also enhanced the uptake of N, P, and K in each plant part of soybean by 5, 5, and 10% (grain), 10, 17, and 13% (straw), and 14, 11, and 11% (root), respectively. The improved nutrient uptake in T-2 increased the total biomass and its distribution in the root, straw, and grain of soybean and maize by 15 and 13%, and 21 and 15%, 20 and 14%, 7 and 10%, respectively compared to T-0. On average, over two years, under T-2, relay-cropped maize obtained 107% of the sole-yield, and relay-cropped soybean obtained 65% of the soleyield. The T-2 defoliation treatment also achieved the highest land equivalent ratio of 1.69 and 1.77, with a net profit of 1301.6 $ ha(-1) and 1293.4 $ ha(-1) in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Following the optimum defoliation treatment of maize in maize-soybean intercrops, i.e., defoliation of the topmost two-leaves, the nutrient uptake can be increased, and the nutrient partitioning over plant organs be better balanced. Optimum defoliation, therefore, enhances the productivity of maize-soybean intercropping systems.

Maize intercropped with soybean (4:1 ratio) recorded the highest mean biological maize equivalent compared to its sole planting or different combinations of legumes. Maize + rajmash recorded the highest mean LER (1.81) followed by maize + cowpea (1.74) and maize + soybean (1.59) all sown in the ratio of 2:1. Intercropping of legumes with maize appeared to be more aggressive than sole planting of maize or legumes. Maize + rajmash (2:1) recorded the highest mean monetary advantage index (7789.0). Highest benefit/cost ratio (5.09 and 4.45) was obtained with maize + soybean (4:1) during 1986 and 1987, respectively.

To try to solve those problems, this study examined four integrated agronomic management treatments-MT (FP: traditional farming practices; OPT-1: an optimized combination of cropping systems and fertilizer treatment; HY: treatment based on high-yield studies; and OPT-2: further optimized combination of cropping systems and fertilizer treatment) and four N application rate treatments-NT (0, 129.0, 184.5, and 300.0 kg ha(-1)). Maize grain yield and N efficiency were determined under each treatment. Grain yield, yield components, individual/population dry matter weight, N partial factor productivity (PFPN), N use efficiency (NUE), and agronomic efficiency of N (AEN) were measured. Results from the NT revealed no significant increase in grain yield in response to N applied above 184.5 kg ha(-1) and increased yield was achieved by the MT. In MT. the change in sowing method from relay intercropping to direct seeding was effective in avoiding maize rough dwarf virus and in encouraging mechanized production; individual and population dry matter accumulation from the tasseling stage (VT) to physiological maturity stage (R6) increased in response to delayed sowing date and harvesting time; grain yield increased significantly from more ears per hectare due to increased planting density; and high N efficiency was achieved after optimizing fertilization patterns. In this study, OPT-2 obtained 67.0%, 104.0%, and 53.5% higher grain yield, PFPN, and NUE, respectively, compared to FP, achieving high yield and high N efficiency. Furthermore, the low AEN value suggests that further reduction in the N application rate of OPT-2 may be possible. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

However, it is unclear how these processes respond to crop management practices when two crops are planted in relay-planting system. In this study, we characterized the C and N accumulation and translocation and their effects on yield formation in a pea (Pisum sativum L.)-maize (Zea mays L.) relay-planting system under different levels of source availabilities. Field experiment was conducted at Wuwei, northwest China, in 2012, 2013, and 2014. Two N fertilizer rates (low - N0 and high - N1) and three maize plant densities (low - D1, medium - D2, and high - D3) were designed to create the different levels of source availabilities. During the co-growth period, the rate of C accumulation in intercropped maize was 7.4-10.8%, 13.8-22.9%, and 13.5-32.0% lower than those in monoculture maize, respectively, under the D1, D2, and D3 treatments; however, after pea harvest, these values were 1.1-23.7%, 33.5-78.9%, and 36.8-123.7% greater than those in monoculture maize. At maturity, intercropped maize accumulated 11.4, 11.5, and 19.4% more N than monoculture maize, respectively, under the D1, D2, and D3 treatments. Compared to the monoculture crops, intercropped pea increased C accumulation in stems by 40.3% with N-application and by 19.5% without N application; intercropping maize increased these values by 16 and 11%, respectively. Overall, increasing N fertilization improved the rates of C and N remobilization from the vegetative tissues to the grain sinks across the different density treatments. In intercropped maize, the stems contributed 22, 33, and 44% more photosynthate to the grain sinks than the leaves, respectively, under the D1, D2, and D3 treatments. Quantitative assessments showed that the enhanced C and N remobilization due to high N fertilization and high plant density led to an increase of GY in the intercropping system by 35% compared with monoculture. We conclude that the enhanced productivity in maize-pea intercropping is a function of the source availability which is regulated by plant density and N fertilization."

J	Lima, JMP				Lima, JMP			Physiological responses of maize and cowpea to intercropping	PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA			English	Article						"plant soil relations; plant water relations; gas exchange; cropping systems"	"SYSTEMS; CORN; YIELD"	The effect of intercropping on plant water status, gas exchange and productivity of maize (Zea mays L.) cv. Centralmex, and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. (Walp)) cv. Pitiuba were evaluated under semi-arid conditions at the Embrapa-Centro de Pesquisa Agropecuaria do Tropico Semi-Arido (CPATSA) at Petrolina, PE, Brazil. The treatments were: maize and cowpea as sole crops, at a population of 40,000 plants ha(-1), and intercropped at a population of 20,000 plants ha(-1). The results obtained in this paper appear to be related to the degree of competition experienced by the components, mainly for water and light. Maize intercropped had higher values of leaf water potential, stomatal conductance, transpiration and photosynthesis than as sole crop. Intercropped cowpea had higher values of leaf water potential but lower stomatal conductance, transpiration and photosynthesis than sole cowpea Maize productivity increased 18% in relation to sole crop whereas a 5% decease was observed with cowpea Despite these facts the Land Equivalent Ratio obtained was 1.13 indicating intercropping advantage over the sole system The higher partial Land Equivalent Ratio observed for maize suggests that this specie was the main component influencing the final productivity of the intercropping system studied.

Five treatments, i.e. sole wheat with conventional irrigation ( W), sole maize with alternate irrigation ( AM), sole maize with conventional irrigation ( CM), wheat/maize intercropping with alternate irrigation (AW/M), and wheat/maize intercropping with conventional irrigation (CW/M). The results showed that root growth was significantly enhanced by alternate irrigation ( AI), root weight density (RWD), root length density (RLD) and root-shoot ratios (R/S) in AI treatments were all higher than those in conventional irrigation (CI) treatments. Moreover, intercropped wheat and maize also had a greater root development at a majority of soil depths than wheat and maize in monoculture. In three years, AW/M always achieved the highest total seed yield under different treatments. Higher yield and reduced irrigation resulted in higher water use efficiency (WUE) for the AW/M treatment. Our results suggest that AI should be a useful water-saving irrigation method on wheat/maize intercropping in arid oasis field where intercropping planting is decreased because of limited water resource.

This study compared the forage yield of sole maize and intercrops of maize with legumes grown under biofertilizer application, and examined the different competition indices in these intercropping patterns. The field assay was conducted during the 2013 growing season at the University of Maragheh in the East Azerbaijan province of Iran. The study was carried out in randomized complete block design (RCBD) with 14 treatments and 3 replications. Experimental treatments included intercropping of maize (inoculation with nitroxin as biological fertilizer) with hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.), maize (no inoculation)-grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.), maize (no inoculation)-sainfoin (Onobrychis vicifolia Scop.), maize (inoculated)-berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.), maize (no inoculation)-vetch, maize (inoculated)-vetch, maize (inoculated)-sainfoin, maize (no inoculation) + berseem clover, and monoculture of maize (no inoculation), maize (inoculation), clover, vetch, grass pea, and sainfoin. Results showed that the maize (inoculation)-vetch intercropping pattern had the highest forage production and the lowest yield production was in sainfoin and grass pea sole crops. Intercropping inoculated maize with vetch also had the highest amounts-of land equivalent ratio (LER) and monetary advantage index (MAI). The higher relative crowding coefficient (RCC) of maize (K = 1.08) compared with those of legumes (k = 0.93) indicated that maize was more competitive than legumes as intercrops. However, among all intercrops, maize (inoculation)-vetch was found to be most profitable. The results obtained from competition and economic indices indicated superior advantage of this intercrop in terms of more efficient land use and more economic benefits than those of other evaluated intercrops.

In order to provide information on productivity and nitrogen use for spring wheat/maize intercropping, a two-year experiment under three N levels and three cropping systems (monocultured wheat, monocultured maize, and intercropped wheat and maize) was carried out in the Hetao Irrigation District of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, to quantify and characterize the growth and yield of the wheat and maize and determine the uptake and use efficiency of nitrogen in two crops. The land equivalent ratio (LER) of the wheat/maize intercropping system ranged from 1.01 to 1.19, and thus land use efficiency was significantly enhanced by this intercropping system. The dry-matter yield and LAI (leaf area index) of wheat were higher in border rows than in inner rows and monocultured rows, indicating an effect of border rows in the intercropping system. The LAI was considerably lower for the intercropped than the monocultured maize, indicating that intercropping limited the vegetative growth of maize. The grain yield and nitrogen uptake of both wheat and maize in two cropping systems were significantly improved with increasing amounts of N application. The LER of intercropping system tended to increase at higher N levels. The patterns of maize growth in the monocultures and intercrops were characterized by fitting expo-linear growth equations to periodic harvest data. Fitted parameters indicated a growth delay in the intercropped maize ranging from 2.39 to 8.24d relative to the maize monoculture. The growth delays were shortest at the moderate N rate among three N levels (2.39 d in 2012 and 2.57 d in 2013). This result could be interpreted in terms of the competitive effect of wheat during the seedling phase of maize, which was weakest at the moderate N rate, causing a comparatively short growth delay. The estimated growth rate during the linear growth phase was highest in the intercrop in the high N treatment (417.5 kg ha(-1) d(-1) in 2012 and 376.7 kg ha(-1) d(-1) in 2013). The physiological nitrogen use efficiency (IE) was more favorable for monocultured wheat and intercropped maize and decreased as N rates increased. The efficiency of the use of N for the entire system was assessed by comparing the relative nitrogen yield total to the relative yield total. The relative nitrogen yield total ranged from 1.06 to 1.23, while the relative yield total ranged from 1.01 to 1.19, indicating that the intercrop used more nitrogen per unit production than did the monocultures.

Its production, however, is undermined by numerous herbivorous arthropods, and agrochemicals used for controlling such pests are increasingly unaffordable. Farmers therefore require cheaper, effective and environmentally sustainable pest management alternatives. This study explored the hypothesis that boosting habitat heterogeneity through organic farming and intercropping enhances arthropod predator-herbivore feeding linkages that naturally suppress herbivory across non-Bt maize fields. To test this, delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotope analyses were conducted to establish feeding pathways from maize, legume intercrops, and marginal vegetation, through arthropod herbivores and predators across 15 small-scale maize fields in western Kenya. Farming and cropping systems' roles in trophic linkages were also assessed. Feeding connections and plant food source contributions to arthropod consumer diets were subsequently determined using Bayesian mixing models, and predator relative efficiencies also evaluated. The results showed significantly stronger predator-herbivore trophic linkages within intercropped than monoculture fields, while farming system showed no effect. Herbivores showed stronger connections to crops than to noncrops, suggesting higher vulnerability for crops. For predators, earwigs derived most basal carbon from maize; wasps and predatory beetles, from legumes; ants, from both maize and legumes; and spiders, from both crops and noncrops. Ants and earwigs are important in maize herbivore regulation, particularly for intercropping; wasps and predatory beetles for regulating legume herbivores; and spiders for whole-field herbivore regulation. Most studies have focused on single species at single-trophic levels, but here we demonstrate, for the first time in sub-Saharan Africa, application of stable isotope analyses to characterize multitrophic feeding interactions that indicate effective agronomic practices for fostering top-down arthropod herbivore suppression in non-Bt maize fields. The results are useful in prescribing field practices with low-impact habitat management for sustainable small-scale agriculture rather than pesticide-based arthropod herbivore control."

This work aimed to study the effects of intercropping patterns on the growth, yield, root morphological characteristics, and interspecific competition of maize and soybean, as well as provide a reference for the development of intercropping patterns of maize and soybean in Northwest China. Three different cropping patterns were designed: monocropping maize, monocropping soybean, and maize-soybean intercropping. Agronomic traits, intercropping indicators such as land equivalent ratio (LER), aggressivity (A), competition ratio (CR), and actual yield loss (AYL), as well as root morphological characteristics were assessed. The results showed that, compared with monocropping, the intercropping maize plant height increased by 6.07-8.40%, and the intercropping soybean plant height increased by 35.27-38.94%; the root length density (RLD) of intercropping maize was higher than that of monocropping maize, the RLD of intercropping soybean was lower than that of monocropping soybean, in the 0-40 cm soil layer the intercropping increased maize RLD by 1.79-7.44% while the soybean RLD was reduced by 3.06-9.46%; the aggressivity of maize was greater than 0 and the competition ratio was greater than 1, which was the dominant species; the maize/soybean land equivalent ratio was 1.18-1.26, which improved the land utilization rate. Therefore, the effect of increasing yield can be achieved by changing the maize and soybean planting method, which is beneficial to the ecological strategy of sustainable development in the northwest region."

Eight species of legumes were tested in three stages of crop development: in the sowing, after the first handweeding and after the second handweeding (30 and 55 days after the sowing). No reduction of weed infestation in the first part of crop development by the intercropping of legumes with maize was observed. The intercropping made handweeding difficult, increasing the time spent in this operation. Good control of weeds was obtained with intercropping, in the harvesting and post-harvesting of maize, varying with the species intercropped and time of intercropping.

This study was designed to explore how shade-tolerant soybean reduces yield loss by regulating its canopy structure and stem characteristics in the maize-soybean strip intercropping system. The soybean cultivars Tianlong No.1 (TL-1, representative of shade-tolerant plants) and Chuandou-16 (CD-16, representative of shade-intolerant plants) were grown in monocropping and intercropping systems from 2020 to 2021 in Chongzhou, Sichuan, China. Regardless of shade-intolerant or shade-tolerant soybean, the canopy and stem of soybean in strip intercropping were weaker than those of the corresponding monoculture. But compared with shade-intolerant soybean, the shade-tolerant soybean slightly changed its spatial structure of canopy and stem morphology and physiology in maize-soybean strip intercropping system, especially in the later growth stages. On the one hand, the canopy of shade-tolerant soybean showed relatively high transmission coefficient (TC) and relatively low leaf area index (LAI) and mean leaf angle (MLA). On the other hand, the stem of shade-tolerant soybean was obviously stronger than that of shade-intolerant soybean in terms of external morphology, internal structure, and physiological characteristics. Additionally, compared with shade-intolerant soybean, shade-tolerant soybean showed higher APnWP (the average net photosynthetic rate of the whole plant) and seed yield in the strip intercropping. The results showed that shade-tolerant soybean increased light energy capture and photosynthesis in the different canopy levels to promote the morphological and physiological development of the stem and ultimately reduce the yield loss of the strip intercropping system. However, the molecular mechanism of low radiation regulating soybean canopy structure (LAI, TC, and MLA) needs further in-depth research to provide theoretical guidance for cultivating plants with ideal canopy shape that can adapt to changing light environment in intercropping system.

The design gave nine intercrops with different proportions of maize and beans, and six sole crops, three of maize and three of beans. Seed yields in both the sole crops were not significantly affected by plant density, so the mean yield was used to calculate the Land Equivalent Ratio (LER), which averaged 1.09 in the long rains but only 0.87 in the short rains. These low values were apparently due to the fact that beans failed to nodulate and fix nitrogen in the study area. The difference in LER between seasons was probably caused by differences in the amount and distribution of rain in relation to crop growth. Maize was more competitive than bean, each maize plant being equivalent to between 0.7 and 3.4 bean plants depending upon the treatment and the season.

In this study, we predicted the grain yield and protein content of maize grown under different irrigation and nitrogen levels in 2018 and 2019 based on canopy spectral reflectance measurements at the V6 (sixth leaf), VT (tassel), and R2 (blister) stages. We developed a predictive approach, namely, spectral reflectance-physiological parameters-productivity, to predict grain yield and protein content on maize crop. First, the quantitative relationships between grain yield and protein content and physiological parameters (canopy chlorophyll content [CCC], leaf carbon accumulation [LCA], leaf nitrogen content [LNC], and leaf nitrogen accumulation [LNA]) were analysed. Then, vegetation indices (VIs) and wavelet features based on spectral reflectance were used to establish estimation models for physiological parameters. The physiological parameters were used as a bridge to connect the spectral reflectance data with grain yield and protein content. The purpose was to establish spectral inversion models to indirectly estimate grain yield and protein content. Results showed that grain yield had a significant linear relationship with CCC and LCA. In addition a grain protein content and LNC and LNA were also significantly related under different water, and nitrogen availability. The physiological parameter models with ratio vegetation indices (RVI), biorthogonal 3.3 (bior3.3), and reverse biorthogonal 1.5 (rbio1.5) were reliable in terms of predictability and applicability. Independent data verification suggested that grain yield was predicted using RVI769,758 (R-2 = 0.773, RMSE = 2.509) in water availability, rbio1.5(781,29) (R-2 = 0.744, RMSE = 2.850) in nitrogen availability, and rbio1.5(772,11) (R-2 = 0.506, RMSE = 2.297) in water-nitrogen availability. In addition, the grain protein content was predicted using RVI793,757 (R-2 = 0.704, RMSE = 0.744) in water availability, bior3.3(743,19) (R-2 = 0.717, RMSE = 0.957) in nitrogen availability, and RVI492,418 (R-2 = 0.715, RMSE = 1.224) in water-nitrogen availability. Therefore, maize grain yield and protein content can be accurately predicted using our modelling approach.

Innovation in alternate mulch with straw and plastic management bolsters yield and water use efficiency in wheat-maize intercropping in arid conditions	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							"CROP PRODUCTIVITY; SOIL-TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WINTER-WHEAT; TILLAGE; CONSERVATION; AGRICULTURE; WHEAT/MAIZE; EVAPORATION; SYSTEMS"	In arid regions, higher irrigation quota for conventional farming causes substantial conflict between water supply and demand for crop production. Innovations in cropping systems are needed to alleviate this issue. A field experiment was conducted in northwestern China to assess whether straw and plastic managements in wheat/maize intercropping could alleviate these issues. Integrating no tillage with two-year plastic and straw mulching (NTMI2) improved grain yields by 13.8-17.1%, compared to conventional tillage without straw residue and annual new plastic mulching (CTI). The NTMI2 treatment reduced soil evaporation by 9.0-17.3% and the proportion of evaporation to evapotranspiration (E/ET) by 8.6-17.5%, compared to CTI. The NTMI2 treatment weakened wheat competition of soil moisture from maize strip during wheat growth period, and enhanced wheat compensation of soil moisture for maize growth after wheat harvest, compared with CTI. Thus, soil water movement potential of NTMI2 was lowest during wheat growth period, but it was highest during maize-independent growth stage after wheat harvest. The NTMI2 treatment increased evapotranspiration before maize silking, decreased from maize silking to early-filling stage, and increased after the early-filling stage of maize, this effectively coordinated water demand contradiction of intercrops at early and late stages. The NTMI2 treatment improved WUE by 12.4-17.2%, compared with CTI. The improved crop yields and WUE was attributed to the coordinated water competition and compensation, and the decreased soil evaporation and E/ET.

However, there are several concerns regarding the efficient use of available environmental resources due to differences in the extent of the establishment periods and due to the occurrence of fallow periods in FCS, as well as regarding the species involved in these systems. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the water (WP) and solar radiation productivity (RP) of PP [pure stands of alfalfa (Medicago saliva L), fertilized and unfertilized stands of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), and fertilized and unfertilized mixed stands of alfalfa/tall fescue] and FCS [including a summer alternative and oats (Avena saliva L); the summer alternative was either maize (Zen mays L) or intercropped maize/soybean (Ovine max L.)] through the analysis of their components, i.e. water (WC) and radiation capture (RC), and their water (WUE) and radiation use efficiency (RUE). Resource capture (WC and RC) was defined as the ratio between captured (evapotranspiration and intercepted solar radiation) and annual available resource (rainfall and incident solar radiation). Resource use efficiency (WUE and RUE) was computed as the dry matter (DM) yield per unit of captured resource. A field experiment was conducted during two consecutive years under rainfed conditions and under non-limiting nitrogen availability in the south-eastern Pampas of Argentina. Perennial pastures were evaluated during both their initial establishment year (Y1) and when already fully established (Y2). Annual-based forage DM yield ranged between 13.0 and 32.4 Mg ha(-1) in Y1 and between 5.1 and 23.5 Mg ha(-1) in Y2. Differences in resource capture between PP and FCS were directly associated with the crop establishment and fallow periods depending on the nature of the considered resource. The highest WP (2.75-3.64 g DM m(-2) mm(-1)) and RP (0.93-1.42 g DM MJ(-1)) were reached by FCS, which did not differ (P > 0.05) from that of fully established fertilized PP. Our results demonstrate that resource productivity in FCS is not necessarily higher than for PP, once PP are fully established."	"[Ojeda, J.

Yet, insects play an important role in regulating ecosystem services such as pollination, soil fertility and pest suppression, so their conservation within agricultural areas is critical. We examined comparative impacts of traditional small-scale low input farming versus large-scale conventional farming systems, and mono-cropped versus inter-cropped systems in Kenyan maize fields on predator, ant and herbivore arthropod species richness and composition. We also considered the value of hedgerows and percentage of surrounding maize cover for arthropod conservation. As expected, traditional farming retained higher herbivore species richness, evenness and abundance, as well as higher predator abundance compared to conventional farming. Percentage maize cover was positively correlated to ant species richness, predator and herbivore abundance, as well as determining species assemblage composition for ants and herbivores. Hedgerow volume and the comparison of mono- vs inter-cropping were important predictors for predator evenness. These results suggest that the low input farming systems retain far higher arthropod numbers, although this does not seem to be due to the use of intercropping on the farms. Rather it seems that hedgerows play an important role in maintaining arthropods. While higher maize coverage surrounding the farm increases the species and abundance of arthropods in the fields, this is most likely due to the high biotope fidelity of arthropods that specialize in open cropping systems such as maize fields. Implications for insect conservation The results here are encouraging as the retention of culturally important farming techniques (i.e., the traditional Kenyan farmers) and small improvements, such as the retention of hedgerows, greatly promotes biodiversity in the farmlands.

Ten representative soil samples were collected in Wierzchucin Krolewski (Kujawsko-Pomorskie Province, NW Poland), an agricultural area belonging to the Potulicka Foundation Group. The cropping systems included a maize monoculture grown continuously for over 30 years and an intercropping mixture (Gorzow mixture) applied in 2020. The study aimed to determine the effect of the intercropping system on the quality and biodiversity of the studied soils and to identify bacterial indicators of sensitivity and resistance to long-term maize monoculture. Therefore, in this study, the impact of the intercrop mixture application on the chemical and biological soil properties and on the diversity of the bacterial community was evaluated by amplifying the 16S rRNA gene sequences and indicators of sensitivity and resistance to long-term maize monoculture were recommended. The results showed that intercropping had a positive effect on soil features and increased the richness and diversity of soil bacteria at the taxonomic level of genera compared to the maize monoculture. Massilia and Haliangium were proposed to be bacterial indicators of sensitivity, while Sphingomonas was recommended to be an indicator of resistance to long-term maize monoculture. Overall, our results evidenced that using an intercropping system may be a sustainable agricultural practice in this area and in north-western Poland.

Intercropping of maize, millet, mustard, wheat and ginger increased land productivity and potential economic returns for smallholder terrace farmers in Nepal	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Seasonal intercropping; Year-round intercropping; Land equivalent ratio; Total land productivity; Terrace agriculture"	"USE EFFICIENCY; FARMING SYSTEM; NITROGEN USE; PEA; COMPETITION; BARLEY; COWPEA; TRANSFORMATIONS; FACILITATION; AGRICULTURE"	"Low nitrogen inputs, low crop yield, and low land productivity are major challenges associated with cereal-based sole cropping systems in Nepal. Crop intensification and diversification by introducing legumes as intercrops could help alleviate these challenges. With the presence of diverse crops and cropping systems, particularly in hilly topographies, a range of intercrop options is required. We compared 10 intercrop combinations to native sole cropping systems in the mid-hills of Nepal for two cropping seasons (2015-2017) to identify the most productive and economic intercrop combinations for smallholder terrace agriculture. In the spring-summer season (i.e., mid-March to mid-July), cowpea (var. Makaibodi and Suryabodi) and bean were intercropped with maize in 1:1 rows, whereas soybean, blackgram, and horsegram were broadcast with millet (30:70 ratios) during the rainy-autumn season (i.e., mid-July to mid-November). Pea and lentil were used as pre-winter/winter intercrops (i.e., mid-November to mid-March) in mustard (30:70 ratios), while wheat was planted with pea. Ginger was planted with maize in 1:1 rows during the spring-summer season in which the maize rows were replaced by soybean and lentil during the rainy-autumn and pre-winter/winter season, respectively. Plots were analyzed for yields of individual crops as well as other agronomic indicators including land equivalent ratio (LER), total land output (TLO), harvest index (HI), and potential economic return. Maize + cowpea var. Makaibodi appeared to be the most productive and economic intercrop combination for the spring-summer season (LER - 1.58 and TLO - 4.26 t ha(-1), 21% higher than the maize sole crop with an increase in potential economic return by 67%) whereas millet + soybean appeared to be the best combination for the rainy-autumn season (LER - 1.40 and TLO - 2.21 t ha(-1), 26% higher than the millet sole crop with a 288% increase in potential income). For the pre-winter/winter season, wheat + pea and mustard + pea combinations appeared to be productive (wheat + pea: LER - 1.31 and TLO - 2.90 t ha(-1) i.e., 16% higher than sole wheat with a 54% increase in potential income; mustard + pea: LER - 1.36 and TLO - 2.14 t ha(-1) i.e., 30% higher than sole mustard with a 15% increase in potential income). The year round intercrop system (i.e., ginger + maize-soybean) displayed a LER value of 2.45 with increased TLO (21.8 t ha (-1) i.e., 2% higher compared to sole ginger) which increased potential economic return by 6%. We conclude that legume intercropping was a robust option across seasons and locations confirming that it could be a promising ecological practice for intensification of cereal-based sole cropping systems on smallholder terraces. Also, it is important to note that soybean and pea provided higher potential net income to farmers as sole crops compared to when they were grown with millet and wheat as intercrops, respectively. It is important that we promote these options to smallholder farmers and disseminate the advantages of legume integration on land productivity, soil fertility management, and income."

However, different spatial patterns of maize and soybean can directly affect the light environment of soybean growth under this system through the combined effects of the altered light quality and the reduced light quanta. This work aimed to investigate the differences in the light environment of the soybean canopy in terms of the red:far-red (R/FR) ratio and the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) as well as the different rates of soybean seedling growth under maize-soybean relay strip intercropping and soybean sole planting, to analyze the relationship between the morphological characteristics and the light environment, and to assess the relative contributions of the R/FR ratio and PAR transmittance to soybean seedling growth in intercropping conditions. Field experiments were performed in 2011-2013. The intercropping patterns involved the wide-narrow row planting of alternating maize and soybean. The light environment of the soybean canopy and the morphology of the soybean seedlings were estimated in the relay strip intercropping system by changing the distances of the maize and soybean rows as well as the number of maize vs. soybean rows per strip. These parameters of the intercropping system were compared with those of the soybean monocultures. Furthermore, the relationship between the light environment of the soybean canopy and its morphological parameters were analyzed using correlation analysis. Incident light in maize-soybean relay strip intercropping systems was partly reflected and absorbed by maize leaves. Thus, the spectral irradiance, R/FR ratio, and PAR of the soybean canopy were decreased with maize-soybean intercropping as compared to soybean monocropping. Simultaneously, the stem diameter, root length, aboveground biomass, total root biomass, and root-shoot ratio of relay intercropped soybean were reduced significantly, while its seedling height was increased. The correlation relationship between morphological parameters of soybean and the light environment (R/FR ratio and PAR transmittance) in different planting pattern were significant (P < 0.05). Compared to PAR transmittance, the R/FR ratio of the relay intercropped soybean canopy was strongly correlated with morphological parameters of soybean seedling (P < 0.01), and the correlation coefficients were higher than 0.88. The response of soybean seedlings to shading by maize was not solely influenced by the PAR or the R/FR ratio. It may be the summed effects of both parameters under relay strip intercropping systems. Therefore, the results reveal the physiological response mechanisms of soybean seedlings to changes in the quality and amount of light, which may support the building three-dimensional growth model of the responses of plant to light quantity and quality, and guide the identification of suitable population planting patterns in the intercropping system in the future.

Competition and yield in intercrops of maize and sunflower for biogas	INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS			English	Article						"Energy crops; Biofuel; Land equivalent ratio; Competition indices; Biogas yield"	"COMMON VETCH; ADVANTAGES; DIGESTION; STABILITY; MIXTURES; QUALITY; OAT"	Maize (Zea mays L.) is widely used for the production of biogas, but intercrops of maize and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L) might improve yield as well as the environmental compatibility of biofuel production. We conducted a field study planting both crops in pure stands and intercrops in three intercropping ratios (maize:sunflower with 33:67,67:33 and 50:50 ratio) at two nitrogen application rates (no fertilizer and 85 kg N/ha as organic fertilizer plus 85 kg N/ha as mineral fertilizer) to determine the competition between the two species and the advantage of intercropping systems at two sites differing in water supply during 2007 and 2009. Dry matter yield of maize and sunflower in mono- and intercropping systems were significantly affected by intercropping ratio, nitrogen fertilizer rate and environments. Sunflower was more competitive than maize especially in intercrops with 67% sunflower. Intercropped sunflower had a higher relative crowding coefficient (K= 1.39) than intercropped maize (0.86). Intercropping with 67% maize had the highest land equivalent ratio (1.11) and relative methane yield advantages (0.94)111 one environment and showed high yield stability. It is concluded that the maize component should be dominant (> 50%) for intercropping. In regions with more rainfall during the growing season, maize-sunflower intercrops required a sufficient N supply to realize a yield advantage. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Therefore, understanding various production systems is necessary to assist producers in decision making. The aim of this experiment was to evaluate whether maize (Zea mays L.) intercropping with Urochloa ruziziensis (R. Germ. and C.M. Evrard) Crins promotes differences in the agronomic performance of maize and if split top-dressing N fertilization in the previous crop (common bean [Phaseolus vulgaris L.]) promotes increase in maize agronomic performance. The experiment was conducted during two agricultural years in southeastern Brazil, with treatments arranged as a split-plot fitted in a randomized block design, with four replications. Main plot was cropping systems (two systems - maize sole and maize intercropped with U. ruziziensis) while subplots comprised 10 combinations of split top-dressed N applications, totaling 90 kg ha(-1), applied to the previously cultivated common bean crop. Regardless of the agricultural year, intercropping with U. ruziziensis sown simultaneously with maize reduced maize yield by 12% on average. Intercropping maize and U. ruziziensis increased soil coverage from an average of 64-100% over maize as an only crop. The agronomic performance of maize grown in sole crop or intercropped with U. ruziziensis was not influenced by the effect of top-dressing N fertilization applied in common bean under no-tillage as previous crop. Intercropping maize with U. ruziziensis is a viable option for producers seeking improved soil coverage or grazing opportunities, however, caution is needed since maize yields may be reduced.

This is aggravated in conventionally managed monocultures, leading to nutrient deficiencies that impair the survival and reproduction of farmland wildlife. For instance, protein deficiencies in wheat or vitamin B3 deficiency in maize reduce by up to 87% the reproductive success of the critically endangered common hamster (Cricetus cricetus), a flagship species of European farmlands. It is urgent to identify and implement agricultural practices that can overcome these deficiencies and help restoring hamsters' reproductive success. As part of a conservation program to diversify farming habitats in collaboration with farmers, we tested whether associations between wheat or maize and three supplemental crops (soybean, sunflower and fodder radish) supported hamsters' performance during hibernation and reproduction. We observed that maize-sunflower, maize-radish and wheat-soybean associations minimized hamsters' body mass loss during hibernation. The wheat-soybean association led to the highest reproductive success (N = 2 litters of 4.5 +/- 0.7 pups with a 100% survival rate to weaning), followed by maize-sunflower and maize-radish. These crop associations offer promising opportunities to overcome nutritional deficiencies caused by cereal monocultures. Their agronomic potential should promote their implementation on a large scale and benefit farmland biodiversity beyond the common hamster.

J	Glowacka, A				Glowacka, Aleksandra			Changes in the uptake of Cu, Zn, Fe and Mn by dent maize in blue lupin/spring oat strip cropping system	ZEMDIRBYSTE-AGRICULTURE			English	Article						"cropping methods; interspecific facilitation; micronutrients; weed control"	"WHEAT; IRON; PEA; BIOFORTIFICATION; RHIZOSPHERE; NUTRITION; MAGNESIUM; CHICKPEA; CALCIUM; PLANTS"	Strip cropping is a form of intercropping used in both tropical and temperate climate zones. Maize is a species often grown in strip cropping, because it responds to the edge effect with a substantial increase in yield. In the experiment, strip cropping of maize with blue lupin and oat was compared to sole cropping of maize in the conditions of mechanical and chemical weed control. A field experiment was conducted in 2008-2010 at the Experimental Station in Zamosc, University of Life Sciences in Lublin (50 degrees 42' N, 23 degrees 6' E). The study examined the effects of the cropping method and weed control methods on the content of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) in maize biomass and their uptake by maize. The impact of the position of the row in the strip and of the adjacent plant species on the content and uptake of these micronutrients was analysed as well. Strip cropping significantly increased Zn and Fe content in maize biomass, reduced Mn content, and did not significantly affect the accumulation of Cu. In the strip cropping, interspecific facilitation between neighbouring plant species was also observed. Placement adjacent to the oat strip contributed to higher Cu content in the maize, while placement next to blue lupin increased the content of Fe and Zn. The highest Mn content was noted in maize grown in the centre row. The results indicate that appropriate selection of plant species for strip cropping can affect the chemical composition of the plants. This makes it possible to eliminate or mitigate mineral deficiencies in the plants.

We conducted a survey of 277 farm households in Northern Tanzania to assess socio-economic factors, field management characteristics, and their association with productivity of maize-pigeonpea intercrops. On each farm, crop assessments were focused on a field that the farmer identified as most important for food supply. Variables associated with yields were evaluated using linear regression and regression classification. Biomass production ranged between 1.0 and 16.6 for maize, and between 0.2 and 11.9 t ha(-1) for pigeonpea (at maize harvest). The corresponding grain yields ranged between 0.1 and 9.5 for maize, and between 0.1 and 2.1 t ha(-1) for pigeonpea. Plant density at harvest, number of years the field had been cultivated, slope, weeding, soil fertility class, fertiliser and manure use were significantly associated with variation in maize grain yield, with interactions among the factors. Fields on flat and gentle slopes with plant density above 24,000 ha(-1) had 28% extra yields when fertiliser was applied, while less than 24,000 plants ha(-1) yielded 16% extra yield when manure was applied. Plant density at harvest was the key factor associated with pigeonpea yield; fields with densities above 24,000 plants ha(-1) yielded an average of 1.4 t ha(-1), while less than 24,000 plants ha(-1) yielded 0.5 t ha(-1). We conclude that performance of intercrops can be enhanced through application of organic and inorganic nutrient sources, and agronomic interventions including weeding, implementing soil conservation measures on steep slopes and optimising plant density."

Maize was generally more growth efficient for biomass accumulation than soybean during the entire growth interval, as assessed using the relative efficiency index (REIc). However, most of sowing proportion at each density displayed a trend of decreased growth with development. Throughout the growth period, the dry matter production and leaf area index (LAI) of maize increased as the plant density increased irrespective of whether it was grown as a sole crop or as an intercrop. However, the effect of increasing cropping density was less obvious for soybean. The LAI values of the sole crop treatment for both maize and soybean were greater than that of the intercropping system, indicating that the presence of maize and soybean together suppressed the respective growth of the two crops. At the final harvest, land equivalent ratios (LER) of 0.84-1.35 indicated resource complementarity in most of the studied intercrops. Complementarity was directly affected by changes in plant densities; the greatest LER were observed in 2 rows maize and 2 rows soybean intercrops at low density. The water equivalent ratio (WER), which characterized the efficiency of water resource use in intercropping, ranged from 0.84 to 1.68, indicating variability in the effect of intercropping on water-use efficiency (WUE).

Many studies have focused on various agricultural management measures to reduce N2O emissions. However, few have investigated soil N2O emissions in intercropping systems. In the current study, we investigate whether maize-soybean intercropping treatments could reduce N2O emission rates. Two differently configured maize-soybean intercropping treatments, 2:2 intercropping (two rows of maize and two rows of soybean, 2M2S) and 2:1 intercropping (two rows of maize and one row of soybean, 2M1S), and monocultured maize (M) and soybean (S) treatments were performed using a static chamber method. The results showed no distinct yield advantage for the intercropping systems. The total N2O production from the various treatments was 0.15 +/- 0.04-113.85 +/- 12.75 mu g m(-2) min(-1). The cumulative N2O emission from the M treatment was 16.9 +/- 2.3 kg ha(-1) over the entire growing season (three and a half months), which was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of the 2M2S and 2M1S treatments by 36.6% and 32.2%, respectively. Two applications of nitrogen (N) fertilizer (as urea) at 240 kg N ha(-1) each induced considerable soil N2O fluxes. Short-term N2O emissions (within one week after each of the two N applications) accounted for 74.4%-83.3% of the total emissions. Soil moisture, temperature, and inorganic N were significantly correlated with soil N2O emissions (R-2 = 0.246-0.365, n = 192, P < 0.001). Soil nitrate (NO3-) and moisture decreased in the intercropping treatments during the growing season. These results indicate that maize-soybean intercropping can reduce soil N-2O emissions relative to monocultured maize.

Cotton-cowpea intercropping and its N-2 fixation capacity improves yield of a subsequent maize crop under Zimbabwean rain-fed conditions	PLANT AND SOIL			English	"Article; Proceedings Paper"	1st International Meeting on Microbial Phosphate Solubilization	JUL 16-19, 2002	Salamanca, SPAIN	Univ Salamanca,Consejo Super Investigac Cientif		"cotton cowpea intercropping; N-2 fixation; N balance; maize yield; rain-fed conditions"	"NITROGEN; LEGUMES; PASTURE; SYSTEM; PLANTS; SOLE"	Intercropping cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp) is one of the ways to improve food security and soil fertility whilst generating cash income of the rural poor. A study was carried out to find out the effect of cotton-cowpea intercropping on cowpea N-2-fixation capacity, nitrogen balance and yield of a subsequent maize crop. Results showed that cowpea suppressed cotton yields but the reduction in yield was compensated for by cowpea grain yield. Cowpea grain yield was significantly different across treatments and the yields were as follows: sole cowpea (1.6 Mg ha(-1)), 1:1 intercrop (1.1 Mg ha(-1)), and 2:1 intercrop (0.7 Mg ha(-1)). Cotton lint yield was also significantly different across treatments and was sole cotton (2.5 Mg ha(-1)), 1:1 intercrop (0.9 Mg ha(-1)) and 2:1 intercrop (1.5 Mg ha(-1)). Intercropping cotton and cowpea increased the productivity with land equivalence ratios (LER) of 1.4 and 1.3 for 1:1 and 2:1 intercrop treatments, respectively. There was an increase in percentage of N fixation (%Ndfa) by cowpea in intercrops as compared to sole crops though the absolute amount fixed (Ndfa) was lower due to reduced plant population. Sole cowpea had %Ndfa of 73%, 1:1 intercrop had 85% and 2:1 intercrop had 77% while Ndfa was 138 kg ha(-1) for sole cowpea, 128 kg ha(-1) for 1:1 intercrop and 68 kg ha(-1) for 2:1 intercrop and these were significantly different. Sole cowpea and the intercrops all showed positive N balances of 92 kg ha(-1) for sole cowpea and 1:1 intercrop, and 48 kg ha(-1) for 2:1 intercrop. Cowpea fixed N transferred to the companion cotton crop was very low with 1:1 intercrop recording 3.5 kg N ha(-1) and 2:1 intercrop recording 0.5 kg N ha(-1). Crop residues from intercrops and sole cowpea increased maize yields more than residues from sole cotton. Maize grain yield was, after sole cotton (1.4 Mg ha(-1)), sole cowpea (4.6 Mg ha(-1)), 1:1 intercrops (4.4 Mg ha(-1)) and 2:1 intercrops (3.9 Mg ha(-1)) and these were significantly different from each other. The LER, crop yields, %N fixation and, N balance and residual fertility showed that cotton - cowpea intercropping could be a potentially productive system that can easily fit into the current smallholder farming systems under rain-fed conditions. The fertilizer equivalency values show that substantial benefits do accrue and effort should be directed at maximizing the dry matter yield of the legume in the intercrop system while maintaining or improving the economic yield of the companion cash crop.

Weed control increased exponentially with soybean groundcover prior to treatment with glyphosate and was maximized at 69 and 84% for Palmer amaranth and Florida pusley, respectively. When glyphosate was applied 2 wk after soybean emergence, yields were improved 390 kg/ha at 494,000 glyphosate-resistant soybean plus 247,000 conventional soybean seeds/ha compared with glyphosate-resistant soybean alone. Further increases in seeding rate of the conventional soybean often had a negative effect on soybean yields due to interference between glyphosate-resistant and conventional soybean prior to applying glyphosate. Glyphosate applied 6 wk after soybean emergence was generally less effective in controlling Palmer amaranth and Florida pusley than at earlier timings because of weed size at application and the overlying soybean canopy. This research indicates the mix-seeded soybean system may suppress early-season weeds, but glyphosate needs to be applied no later than 4 wk after soybean emergence to ensure optimum yields and prevent interference between glyphosate-resistant and conventional soybean.

In order to identify the best cropping system of two forage species (Urochloa brizantha and Urochloa ruzizienses) intercropped with maize (Zea mays L.) in no tillage system, the present study was conducted. Maize was seeded intercropped with forage in five cropping systems. The experimental design was in randomized blocks in factorial scheme (2x4+1) with four replications. There were evaluated: dry mass of maize straw, dry mass of urochloa straw, total dry mass of straw, maize plant population, mass of 1000 grain and grain yield. The results showed that maize intercropped with urochloa had no negative effect on grain yield and increased the input of dry matter in the production system under no-tillage system. The choice of a particular cropping system depends on the management and availability of machines, since all systems showed positive behavior in respect of grain yield and straw production.

A field experiment was conducted on different measures of plastic mulching and straw retention (no-tillage with straw standing in wheat strip and two-year plastic mulching in maize strip, NTSSI2; no-tillage with straw covering in wheat strip and two-year plastic mulching in maize strip, NTSI2; conventional tillage with straw incorporation in wheat strip and annual new plastic mulching in maize strip, TSI; and conventional tillage without straw retention in wheat strip and annual new plastic mulching in maize strip, CTI), which were used in strip intercropping from 2014 to 2016. We determined the effects of integrated measures on coordinating water competition and compensation between inter-strips. The intercropped wheat competed for soil water from the maize strips during the wheat growth period. After wheat harvest, the intercropped maize obtained compensatory soil water from the wheat strips. The results showed that the NTSI2 treatment favorably weakened wheat competition of soil water from the maize strip and strengthened wheat strip compensation of soil water for maize growth compared with CTI treatment. Thus, compared to the CTI treatment, the potential movement amount of soil water in NTSI2 was lowest, decreased by 25.8-58.9% during wheat growth period, but it arrived at the highest, increased by 42.2-60.8% after wheat harvest. The NTSI2 treatment improved grain yield by 13.8-17.1% and enhanced WUE by 12.4-17.2% compared with CTI. The improvement in crop yield and WUE was partly attributed to the coordinated water competition between the inter-strips and the water compensation effect from the early-maturing wheat to the late-maturing maize."

Here we determined grain yield, land equivalent ratio (LER), and water use efficiency (WUE) of maize (Zea mays L.)-pea (Pisum sativum L.) intercropping and quantified the magnitude of the contribution by belowground interspecies interactions. Field experiments were conducted at Wuwei (37 degrees 96 ' N, 102 degrees 64 ' E), northwest China, in 2009 and 2010. Treatments included sole maize, sole pea, and three maize-pea intercropping systems that, respectively, had no root-barrier (M-P), plastic sheet barrier (PM-P), and nylon mesh barrier (NM-P). The plastic sheet and nylon mesh barriers were vertically placed to 1-m deep between the two intercrop strips; this allowed the quantification of belowground interspecies interactions. On a per hectare basis, the maize-pea intercropping increased grain yields by an average of 31.3% and improved WUE by 21.9% compared with the corresponding sole maize and sole pea. The LER value was 1.33 for the M-P system, suggesting that the grain yield produced by the maize-pea intercrops per hectare is equivalent to the yield that sole crops would produce with 33% additional farmland. The M-P system had the yield of 11,034 kg ha(-1), which was 21.9% greater compared with the PM-P system and 9.7% greater compared with the NM-P system. The comparison of the three intercropping systems revealed that belowground interspecies interactions contributed 59.3% of the increased yields and 88.9% of the improved WUE. Of the increased yield, about 40% was due to water movement between the two strips and the remaining 19% was due to root overlapping activity. We conclude that sharing resources in the rooting zones between the intercrops serve as a major mechanism responsible for the large yield and WUE advantages for the maizepea intercropping in arid areas."

Strategies are needed to reduce costs of crop establishment while maintaining or improving productivity. The objective of this study was to assess the viability of ratooning pigeonpea in maize (Zea mays L.) pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.) intercropping over four cropping seasons (2012-2015) at Ilonga Research Institute, eastern Tanzania. Two major factors were considered: cropping system (intercropping vs. sole cropping) and tillage (conventional tillage vs. no-tillage), while ratooning (cutting pigeonpea at 30 cm and 60 cm above ground) was a minor factor. Total grain yields of all intercropped maize and pigeonpea were significantly higher than those of maize and legume in the corresponding sole crop treatments showing a high complementarity between maize and pigeonpea crops. All the intercrop treatments had LER values greater than 1, even in situations where component crop yields were small. Results suggested that a ratooning height of 30 cm allowed large maize yields whereas a height of 60 cm allowed larger pigeonpea yields, and the choice of ratooning height might depend on the farmer's objective per season. The tillage system had no significant effect on crop yield. The hypothesis that ratooning pigeonpea is an effective cost reduction strategy that maintains or increases productivity in maize-pigeonpea intercropping was supported. When ratooning was practiced in the intercrops, the seed cost reduction of 23% per season was recorded. Ratooning in sole pigeonpea entailed a larger seed cost reduction from TZS40, 000.00 to TZS13, 333.00 (1US$=TZS2, 000.00) per season representing a reduction of 67%. The cost reduction due to ratooning was significant as generally less than 10% of the smallholder farmers are able to purchase significant quantities of seed. The prevailing cropping systems and general farmers' resource endowment in eastern Tanzania coupled with the fragmented seed systems especially for legumes provide a greater scope for the wide scale practice of ratooning pigeonpea in maize-pigeonpea intercropping, reducing seed costs while maintaining productivity.

While efforts have been made to maintain the yield of the taller maize crop, there is limited understanding of how the morphology, growth and yield of the lower soybean crop changes in response to the shading by maize. We therefore conducted a three-year field experiment from 2013 to 2015 to investigate the changes in light environment, growth of individual organs, biomass, and grain yield of soybean under two intercropping patterns (1M1 S, one row of maize with one row of soybean; 2M2S, two rows of maize with two rows of soybean) as compared to monoculture. Our results showed that at soybean flowering stage, the R:FR ratio at the top of soybean canopy was reduced 17-21% more than the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) under intercropping compared to monoculture, with 15-19% more reduction under 1M1S than 2M2S. This led to increased internode lengths, plant height and specific leaf area (SLA), but reduced branching of soybean plants under intercropping. These morphological changes enabled the crop to intercept relatively more light and the shading also increased the light use efficiency (LUE) of soybean. However, these positive responses were not able to compensate the effect of reduced leaf area (due to smaller leaf size and less branching) and total light interception, leading to reduced biomass and grain. The reduction in grain yield was mainly caused by the reduced number of grains (particularly on the middle nodes) produced by the intercropped soybean plants, while the grain size remained unchanged. The data and results of this study may be used to develop and parameterize crop models for simulating development and growth of soybean crop in response to changes in the light environment under intercropping.

Root foraging elicits niche complementarity-dependent yield advantage in the ancient 'three sisters' (maize/bean/squash) polyculture	ANNALS OF BOTANY			English	Article						"'Three sisters'; niche complementarity; polyculture; intercropping; nitrogen; phosphorus; plant nutrition; root architecture; root foraging; maize; bean; squash; Zea mays; Phaseolus vulgaris; Cucurbita"	"ZEA-MAYS L.; ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; NUTRIENT-UPTAKE; RESOURCE USE; HAIR LENGTH; COMPETITION; BIODIVERSITY; ARCHITECTURE; NITROGEN"	Background and Aims Since ancient times in the Americas, maize, bean and squash have been grown together in a polyculture known as the 'three sisters'. This polyculture and its maize/bean variant have greater yield than component monocultures on a land-equivalent basis. This study shows that below-ground niche complementarity may contribute to this yield advantage. Methods Monocultures and polycultures of maize, bean and squash were grown in two seasons in field plots differing in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability. Root growth patterns of individual crops and entire polycultures were determined using a modified DNA-based technique to discriminate roots of different species. Key Results The maize/bean/squash and maize/bean polycultures had greater yield and biomass production on a land-equivalent basis than the monocultures. Increased biomass production was largely caused by a complementarity effect rather than a selection effect. The differences in root crown architecture and vertical root distribution among the components of the 'three sisters' suggest that these species have different, possibly complementary, nutrient foraging strategies. Maize foraged relatively shallower, common bean explored the vertical soil profile more equally, while the root placement of squash depended on Pavailability. The density of lateral root branching was significantly greater for all species in the polycultures than in the monocultures. Conclusions It is concluded that species differences in root foraging strategies increase total soil exploration, with consequent positive effects on the growth and yield of these ancient polycultures.

This research investigated the effect of the amounts of irrigation in combination with tillage practices on soil evaporation (E), water consumption (ET) characteristics, and grain yield performance and water use efficiency (WUE) for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) intercropped with maize (Zea mays L.) in strip planting in an Oasis region. The field experiment, conducted at Wuwei station during 2008-2010, had two tillage systems (reduced tillage with wheat stubble retention vs. conventional tillage without stubble retention), and three (low, medium, and high) levels of irrigation, in a randomized complete block design. Averaged across three years, soil evaporation with medium and high levels of irrigation was 6.8% and 5.4% greater than that with low level of irrigation, respectively. Total water consumption of wheat/maize crops under the medium and high irrigation levels was 8.5% and 18.5% greater, respectively, than that under low irrigation. However, grain yields were similar under the medium and high levels of irrigation, so was WUE. The effect of tillage on the wheat/maize intercropping was inconsistent across years or among treatments: soil moisture at harvest was 3.0-7.6% greater in the fields with reduced tillage compared with those with conventional tillage in 2008 and 2009, but no difference was found in 2010; the E/ET ratio of reduced tillage was 9% lower than the ratio under conventional tillage in 2008, 3% higher in 2010, but no difference between the two tillage systems in 2009. Across three years, there was a general trend that the WUE of the wheat/maize intercropping system with reduced tillage was greater (by 4-11%) than that with conventional tillage. We conclude that a medium level of irrigation is sufficient to achieve crop yields and WUE equivalent to those under high level of irrigation, provided that a reduced tillage practice is applied to the wheat/maize intercropping in Oasis areas.

One alternative to conventional farming systems is the implementation of diversification practices that increase diversity in- and around- the field to increase the incidence of natural enemies, reduce pest pressure and enhance crop production. In this review we illustrate the theoretical framework on which diversification practices are based and contrast it with the empirical evidence. The detailed review of 62 original studies published in the last ten years, shows that diversification practices (a) enhance natural enemies in 52%, (b) reduce pest pressure in 53% and (c) increase yield in only 32% of the cases where this was examined. We discuss these results On the basis of the reviewed Studies providing key elements that should he taken into account to design diversification practices that can be implemented as competitive pest management strategies that cover the farmers' needs, reducing the intensive use of agrochemicals.

It is unclear whether improved farming systems can be developed to tackle those issues through a sustainable agriculture. Here three farming practices that have proven to be essential and successful, which were: (a) crop intensification through strip intercropping, (b) water harvesting through conservation tillage; and (c) carbon sequestration through improved crop residue management options, were integrated in one cropping system. We hypothesize that the integrated system allows the increase of crop yields with improved water use efficiency, while reducing carbon emissions from farming. The hypothesis was tested in field experiments at Hexi Corridor (37 degrees 96'N, 102 degrees 64'E) in northwest China. We found that the integrated system increased soil moisture (mm) by 7.4% before sowing, 10.3% during the wheat-maize co-growth period, 8.3% after wheat harvest, and 9.2% after maize harvest, compared to the conventional sole cropping systems. The wheat/maize intercrops increased net primary production by 68% and net ecosystem production by 72%; and when combined with straw mulching on the soil surface, it decreased carbon emissions by 16%, compared to the monoculture maize without mulch. The wheat/maize intercrops used more water but increased grain yields by 142% over the monoculture wheat and by 23% over the monoculture maize, thus, enhancing water use efficiency by an average of 26%. We conclude that integrating strip intercropping, conservation tillage as well as straw mulching in one cropping system can significantly boost crop yields, improve the use efficiency of the limited water resources in arid areas, while, lowering the carbon emissions from farming. The integrated system may be considered in the development of strategies for alleviating food security issues currently experienced in the environment-damaged and water-shortage areas.

The intercropping of maize with legumes provides weed control; after senescence, the nutrients accumulated by plants are released, recycling nutrients. The study of plant species and their diversity is called phytosociology. This study aimed at evaluating the accumulation of thy phytomass by maize intercropped with legumes and weeds species, and at evaluating nutrient cycling and the phytosociology of weeds. The experiment consisted of maize intercropped with legumes cover crops: jack-beans, Brazilian jack-beans, velvet bean, lablab-beans, and pigeon pea, and the control treatment (maize without intercrop), all without chemical or mechanical weed control. Maize was sown in the plots, and legumes were sown 64 days after maize. Maize was harvested 120 days after sowing (DAS), and legumes at 144 DAS. Weeds were sampled at 84 and 144 DAS. It was possible to evaluate the accumulation of dry phytomass, the nutrient content of the intercrop components, and the phytosociology of weeds. The phytomass accumulation by maize was not affected by the intercrop with legtunes. The intercrop with velvet bean accumulated higher thy phytomass and suppressed weeds. Jack beans accumulated thy mass, but did not suppress weeds. The intercropping system changed the diversity of weeds. Panicum maximum.

Most soils of the West African savanna zones are so poor that the efficiency of mineral fertilizers, if applied, is very low. For this reason and because of their high cost and unavailability, many small-scale farmers are reluctant to apply fertilizer. This work investigates a fertilizer management strategy using integrated soil fertility management with a leguminous cover crop (mucuna) so as to improve the soil fertility and increase the use efficiency of fertilizer. The experiment was conducted in the coastal savanna of Togo at Djaka Kope. The aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of mucuna short fallow (MSF) in increasing maize grain yield through an improved use efficiency of mineral fertilizer. A 2-year maize - mucuna relay intercropping system was compared with continuous sole maize cropping. Fertilizer treatments were factorial combinations of 0, 50 and 100 kg nitrogen (N) ha(-1) and 0, 20 and 40 kg phosphorus (P) ha(-1). While maize grain yield was significantly increased by N fertilization, P did not show any important effect on grain yield. With no N and P applied, grain yield after MSF was on average 40% (572 kg ha(-1)) higher than without. The response to N was much greater than the response to MSF, indicating that N was undoubtedly the key element for maize yield building. P fertilization and MSF together positively influenced the apparent N recovery fraction (NRF). N uptake alone did not reflect on its own the yield obtained, and the relationship between grain yield and N uptake is shifted by MSF, with the grain yield increase per unit of N uptake being higher with than without MSF. Combining MSF and P fertilization may therefore lead to improved N use efficiency, making the application of fertilizer N (lower rates) more attractive to small-scale farmers.

To ensure sustainable production, causes of soil degradation must be checked and other sources of fertility provided for crops. To achieve this, the use of herbaceous and forage legumes intercropped with maize were evaluated. The Study was conducted in Zaria, Nigeria (longitude 7degrees 30' and 7degrees 50' East, latitude 11degrees 00' and 11degrees 10' North), at the Ahmadu Bello University farm. Results show that the forage legume/maize treatments did not significantly deplete available soil moisture more than the sole maize treatment. Also, the legume/maize treatments resulted in positive carbon credits and higher total nitrogen content in the soils after two years of continuous cropping. Macrotyloma uniflorum, Stylosanthes hamata, and Lablab purpureus/maize intercrops did not reduce maize grain yields compared to the sole maize treatment. For sustained optimum grain yield of maize and improved soil conditions, Macrotyloma/maize intercrop treatment is recommended.

In the past decade, Striga has reduced maize yields for smallholder farmers (cultivating less than two hectares), not only in southern Africa, but across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Parasitism of maize by Striga leads to significant grain yield losses. Intercropping legumes within maize-based systems has been shown to decrease Striga infestation and improve food security. Before cultivating these cropping systems, farmers consider different attributes associated with them (e.g., efforts or cost of inputs). Understanding farmers' preferences for these attributes generates insights as how to increase adoption of intercropping as a Striga control practice. We use discrete choice experiments to identify the trade-offs which Malawian farmers are willing to accept among the attributes of choice scenarios for Striga control practices. Results indicate that farmers are willing (and in some cases unwilling) to sacrifice different fractions of maize yield for suppression of Striga, labour intensity, soil fertility and intercropped legume yield. Male and female farmers have heterogeneous preferences for these attributes. These findings have significant implications for Striga management and its effect on a crop that sustains the livelihoods of more than 80% of Malawians.

A field experiment was conducted for two consecutive years between 2013 and 2014 to investigate the effects of maize and soybean relay strip intercropping systems on the uptake and utilization of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. The treatments included 40:160 (T1, maize narrow and wide row spacing of 40 and 160cm, where two rows of soybean with a 40cm row were planted in the wide rows. The area occupation ratio of maize and soybean both were 50% of the every experimental block), 80:120 (T2, maize narrow and wide row spacing of 80 and 120cm, the soybean planting was the same as T1 treatment. The area occupation ratio of maize and soybean were 60% and 40% of the every experimental block), 100:100 (T3, one row of maize and one row of soybean with a 100-cm row. The area occupation ratio of maize and soybean was the same as T1 treatment), sole cropping of maize (CK1, The area occupation ratio of maize was 100% of the every experimental block), and sole cropping of soybean (CK2, The area occupation ratio of soybean was 100% of the every experimental block). The results show that, compared with the sole cropping system (sole maize), the economic yields in T1, T2, and T3 treatments increased by 761, 536, and 458kgha(-1), respectively, and the biological yields increased by 2410, 2127, and 1588kgha(-1). The uptake and utilization of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in T1, T2, and T3 treatments were significantly higher than those in sole crops, and the nutrient advantage is mainly due to nutrient uptake rather than nutrient use efficiency. The land equivalent ratio values in T1, T2, and T3 treatments were 1.43, 1.32, and 1.20, respectively. In particular, the economic and biological yield in T1 treatment exhibited potential as an intercropping pattern.

However, the yields from farmers' fields have not been investigated yet. Yield gap analysis provides a framework to examine land productivity, i.e. the actual yields realized in farmers' fields versus the potential yields when a crop is grown with water and nutrients non-limiting and biotic stresses effectively controlled. In this research, we aim to define yield potentials and yield gaps in intercropping systems, and apply this to an irrigated wheat-maize relay intercrop in Gaotai county (Zhangye city), Gansu province in northwest China. Data from three field experiments (2010 2012) were used to calibrate and test crop models for two sole crops and an intercrop. Potential yields were estimated for five years (2010-2014) by model simulations, and actual yields were determined by surveys of 310 farm households in 2014. The main results are: 1) in sole crops, the potential yield of spring wheat is 73 t ha(-1) and the potential yield of maize is 14.2 t ha(-1); 2) in a wheat-maize relay intercrop with a land area ratio of 0.5 for each crop, the potential yield of wheat is 4.8 t ha(-1) and that of maize is 12.0 t ha(-1); 3) comparing the yield in the intercrop and the expected yield (i.e. the yields in sole crops multiplied by the land area ratio in the intercrop for each species), the intercropped wheat gained 32% under potential growing conditions and 67% under actual growing conditions; while the intercropped maize gained 69% under potential growing conditions and 64% under actual growing conditions; 4) farmers achieved 67% of potential yield for sole wheat, and 85% for intercropped wheat; however, farmers achieved only 51% of potential yield for sole maize and 49% for intercropped maize. The farm survey showed that wheat-maize relay intercropping is still widely used by farmers in Gaotai county, and farmers gained extra yield from wheat-maize relay intercropping compared to sole crops, but the gap between potential and actual yields is especially large for maize in this region. Water is likely to be the main limiting factor for maize production despite the irrigation. We conclude by exploring how grain production in Gaotai county would be affected by substituting intercrops by sole crops. We find that the grain production will decrease between 18% to 44% if all the farmers would replace wheat-maize relay intercropping by either wheat or maize sole crop compared to the current land use. Intercropping thus contributes to food production at the regional level, and this contribution can be further increased by narrowing yield gaps. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Yield Response of Intercropped Soybean and Maize Under Rhizobia (Bradyrhizobium japonicum) Inoculation and P and K Fertilization	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS			English	Article						"Biological nitrogen fixation; harvest index; intercropping; legumes; plant nutrition; soil fertility"	"BEAN PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS; SYMBIOTIC NITROGEN-FIXATION; NUTRIENT-UPTAKE; L.; NODULATION; AVAILABILITY; LEGUME; GROWTH; SOIL"	A 2-year trial was carried out at the Tanzania Coffee Research Institute (TaCRI) farm in northern Tanzania. The aim was to assess the response of soybean and maize yield attributes to cropping systems, rhizobia inoculation, and phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilization. The study was laid out in a split-split plot design replicated thrice. The statistical analyses were performed using the 3-way analysis of variance in a factorial arrangement. The computation was performed using the STATISTICA software. The Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) was used to compare the treatment means at p = 0.05 level of significance. The results showed that both cropping systems, rhizobia inoculation, and P and K fertilization significantly (p = 0.05) influenced most of the soybean yield parameters assessed in this study. Specifically, cropping systems significantly (p = 0.05) improved the number of pods per plant, biological yield, grain yield, and harvest index (HI) (2015 and 2016) of soybean. Rhizobia inoculation also significantly (p = 0.05) improved soybean yield attributes such as the number of pods, 100 seed weight, biological yield and grain yield of soybean (2015 and 2016), and HI in soybean (2015). P and K fertilization also significantly (p = 0.05) improved different yield attributes of soybean over the control. It was noted that increasing potassium from 20 to 40 kg/ha improved most of the soybean yield parameters relative to the control. Doubling of P from 26 kg to 52 kg/ha did not significantly change the soybean yield parameter. The doubled combined fertilizers did not significantly increase the yield parameters of soybean suggesting the use of a lower dose of combined fertilizers. Intercropping maize with rhizobia-inoculated soybean significantly improved maize yield compared with intercrop without inoculation. Monocropped maize gave relatively the same yield as those of maize intercropped with inoculated soybean. Fertilization with P and K also improved the yield attributes of maize over the control.

However highest N and P uptake was recorded from. the sole crop. Intercropping suppressed the dry-matter accumulation and N and P uptake of groundnut. Weed-control measures enhanced the dry-matter accumulation of both sunflower and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.). Combined application of pendimethalin and 1 hand-weeding recorded the highest dry matter of both component crops. On an average, combined application of both weed-control measures showed 30.5 and 46.0% higher uptake of N and P by sunflower and 222 and 370% by groundnut respectively. Productivity and N uptake of maize (Zea mays L.) was significantly higher when it was preceded by intercropping of sunflower and groundnut. Weeds controlled by both pendimethalin and 1 hand-weeding also enhanced the productivity and N uptake by succeeding maize.

Growth and photosynthetic responses of soybean seedlings to maize shading in relay intercropping system in Southwest China	PHOTOSYNTHETICA			English	Article						"carbon accumulation; chlorophyll a fluorescence; photosynthetic pigment; planting pattern; productivity"	"CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; USE EFFICIENCY; LEAF-AREA; LIGHT ENVIRONMENT; THUJA-PLICATA; FOOD SECURITY; YIELD; PRODUCTIVITY; MORPHOLOGY; WHEAT"	Intercropping, a traditional and worldwide cropping practice, has been considered as a paradigm of sustainable agriculture based on complementary mechanisms among different crop species. Soybean (Glycine max) is widely relay intercropped about 60 days before maize (Zea mays) harvest in Southwest China. However, shade caused by tall maize plants may be a limiting factor for soybean growth at a seedling stage. In field research, we studied the ecophysiological responses of two widely cultivated soybean varieties [Gongqiudou494-1 (GQD) and Gongxuan 1 (GX)] to maize shading in a relay intercropping system (RI) compared with monocropped soybean plants (M). Our results showed that soybean seedlings intercropped with maize exhibited significantly downregulated net photosynthetic rate (P (N)) (-38.3%), transpiration rate (-42.7%), and stomatal conductance (-55.4%) due to low available light. The insignificant changes in intercellular CO2 concentration and the maximum efficiency of PSII photochemistry suggested that the maize shading-induced depressions in P (N) were probably caused by the deficiency of energy for carbon assimilation. The significantly increased total chlorophyll (Chl) content (+27.4%) and Chl b content (+52.2%), with lowered Chl a/b ratios (-20.5%) indicated soybean plants adjusted their light-harvesting efficiency under maize shading condition. Biomass and leaf area index (LAI) of seedlings under RI decreased significantly (-78.7 and -71%, respectively) in comparison with M. Correlation analysis indicated the relative reduction in biomass accumulation was caused by the decline in LAI rather than P (N), it affected negatively the final yields of soybean (32.8%). Cultivar-specific responses to maize shading were observed in respects of LAI, biomass, and grain yield. It indicated that GX might be a better cultivar for relay intercropping with maize in Southwest China.	"[Su, B. Y.; Cui, L.; Yong, T. W.; Yang, W.

The present study aimed to investigate the plasticity of wheat and maize roots and their responses to nitrogen (N) application rates and neighboring species in wheat/maize intercropping. The roots of wheat and maize were sampled three times by auger after about 90 days of co-growth in the intercropping treatment with five levels of N application and sole crops at one N application rate. Intercropped wheat altered its root length density (RLD) and lateral root distribution with different N application regimes, while lateral root distribution of intercropped maize was less sensitive to N application regimes. In addition, wheat had a 54.5 % (38-69 days) -375 % (0-37 days) higher N uptake rate per unit root length (NURl) when intercropped with maize compared with sole cropping but intercropped maize had either 58.3 % lower (0-37 days) or similar NURl than did sole cropped maize at the same N application rate. Our findings suggest that the competitive ability of the plant species for underground resources is conducive to plasticities in RLD, lateral root distribution in response to soil N, and N uptake efficiency to neighboring species.

FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Intercropping system; No-tillage; Plastic film mulching; Interspecific relation; Irrigation; Soil temperature"	"SOIL-TEMPERATURE; WATER-USE; USE EFFICIENCY; YIELD; WHEAT; MULCH"	"Compensatory growth is a mechanism that explains the recovery in stature and yield of a subordinate crop after the dominant competitor is harvested from an intercropping system. This mechanism might be affected by agronomic practices, particularly those related to the crop water supply in arid regions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of tillage and irrigation practices on competition and compensatory growth in pea-maize intercropping systems at Wuwei station in northwest China from 2014 to 2016. The field experiment included two forms of tillage with plastic film (no-tillage, NT; conventional tillage CT) and three irrigation levels (450 mm, I1; 495 mm, I2; 540 mm, I3). As pea was planted first, it was the dominant competitor and caused greater suppression of maize when crops were grown under I1 > I2 > I3 levels in NT than at the corresponding irrigation levels in CT. Compensatory growth of maize after pea harvest was, on average, 8 to 16% greater in the NT than CT. Growing the intercropped maize strip under NT with plastic mulch was as effective as CT with plastic mulch to achieve a favorable yield outcome. However, the intercropped pea yield was 20-29% greater, with 0-5% more maize yield under deficit irrigation level (I1) and the land equivalent ratio was 3-15% greater in NT than CT plots during this study. Yield gains were related to improved water use efficiency, which was 8 to 18% greater in the intercropping system under NT than CT management. We recommend the NT with plastic mulch method as a water-saving strategy that can sustain the productivity of maize-pea intercropping systems while reducing plastic pollution from agricultural activities in arid regions."

However, cover crops may require nitrogen (N) fertilization management to be adjusted to obtain a high GY in intercropping systems. This study was carried out over 2 years in southeastern Brazil using randomized complete block design in a split-plot scheme. The plots were composed of three cropping systems: sole maize, maize + U. ruziziensis and maize + C. spectabilis. The subplots consisted of four N levels: 0, 70, 140 and 210 kg/ha. The GY of the maize + U. ruziziensis may be reduced by 13% compared to the sole maize. The GY of the sole maize increased up to 11.3 Mg/ha for 95 kg/ha of N in the first year and 6.7 Mg/ha for 169 kg/ha of N in the second year. The GY of the maize + U. ruziziensis intercropping system showed linear increments of 120 kg/ha for every 10 kg/ha of N applied. In the maize + C. spectabilis intercropping, GY increased up to 9.8 Mg/ha for 201 kg/ha of N in the first year, without any variation during the second year. The land equivalent ratio (LER) of intercropping was increased by more than 35% compared to that of sole maize, and N fertilization increased the LER of the sole maize and maize + U. ruziziensis intercropping. Maize intercropping had higher LER values with greater demand for nitrogen to obtain similar yields compared to sole maize cropping.	"[Souza, S. S.; Flores, J. A.; Coelho, A. P.; Deienno, J.

Integration of drought tolerant and N-2-fixing crops into maize-based cropping systems is a risk-averse strategy that also improves nitrogen cycling. A field experiment was carried out during the 2017/18 and 2018/19 cropping seasons in Goromonzi district in Zimbabwe. The trials were established on 14 farms, and on two field types (homefields and outfields), with eight treatments from a combination of cropping systems (maize and cowpea monocrops or maize/cowpea intercrops) and with or without nitrogen fertilizer (+N; -N). The trials were implemented on the same field plots for the two consecutive seasons. An improved cowpea variety and a landrace were used. The objectives were to determine 1) the productivity of the different cropping systems under variable soil fertility conditions, 2) N-2-fixation of the two cowpea types when planted as monocrops or intercrops, and 3) mineral composition of maize and cowpea grains from intercrops and sole crops. Contrary to expected results, soil properties were not significantly different (P > 0.05) between field types. The land equivalent ratios (LER) were >1 for both seasons, implying improved land productivity under intercropping. Intercropping significantly reduced cowpea nodulation and active nodules, but not the total nodule weight, resulting in similar proportion of nitrogen derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa) for cowpea grown as monocrop or in intercropping with maize. However, the total amount of fixed nitrogen was reduced in intercropping systems due to the smaller cowpea biomass compared to monocropping. Maize and cowpea grain mineral contents (Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Ca, Mg, P, K) were significantly affected by the cropping season only. We showed that intercropping maize with cowpea generally increases system productivity, in addition to substantial amounts of nitrogen being added to the system through N-2-fixation. However, intercropping was not an agronomic biofortification option in these nutrient-depleted soils. Finally, annual variation in grain mineral quality can be larger than the annual variation in grain yield, potentially posing serious challenges to human nutrition."

Nitrogen and light partitioning in a maize (Zea mays L.)/soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) intercropping system under subtropical climatic conditions in Nepal was studied during the summers of 1988 and 1989. Factors studied included the cropping system (sole cropping vs. intercropping), three levels of nitrogen fertilization (0, 35 and 70 kg N ha-1) and two spatial arrangements of the intercrops. During the second season, a non-nodulating soybean isoline of the same cultivar was used as a control. The cropping system had a limited impact on soybean nodulation, since intercropped soybean nodules dry weights were only 11% and 6% inferior, as compared with sole cropped soybean, in 1988 and 1989, respectively. However, the seed N yield of sole cropped nodulating soybean was significantly higher than the total seed N yield of intercropped maize/nodulating soybean. The reverse effect was measured in the case of the maize/non-nodulating soybean intercropping system. Intercropping maize with soybean did not result in the interception of a higher proportion of the incident photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) than sole soybean, except early during the season. Intercropped nodulating soybean developed a dense underlying canopy, and was able to intercept 95% of incident PPFD after maize harvest.

The agronomic and economic benefits of maize-bean (Zea mays L. -Phaseolus vulgaris L.) intercropping were studied for 5 yr in a complete factorial with: 0, 1, and 2 weedings (W0, W1, W2); and single (MB) and double (MBB) rows of bean alternated with one row of maize. Sole crop maize and bean were included. Weed infestation in intercrop was 30% less compared with sole crop bean but with inconsistent differences across years. Weed biomass was 13% less with MBB compared with sole-cropped maize. Ears m(-2) were 55% more in seasons with better rainfall compared with 1999 and 16% more with W1 or W2 compared W0. Mean maize grain yield was 3.74 Mg ha(-1). Weeding frequency (WF) effect on maize grain yield was inconsistent across years but yield was 75% more with W2 compared with W0. Overall, maize grain yield was 19% more with MB compared with MBB but the effect was significant in 1997 only.

The objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness of fanning systems in management of PPN and to recommend the best practice to fanners. Therefore, two field trials were established, one in farmer fields and one on-station, using maize (Zea mays L.), intercropped with beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and in rotation with beans as a sole crop. Organic farming (that received compost, Tithonia diverstfolia and neem cake (Azadirachta indica)) was compared to conventional farming (that received fertilizer and nematicide), farmer practice (that received manure, Tithonia diversifolia and wood ash), and a farm with no input application (control). After three years of continuous cultivation, twelve genera of PPN were recovered from soil and/or root samples from the trials. Under inter- and sole-cropping at both sites, the abundance of PPN including Pratylenchus and Meloidogyne were significantly reduced in the organic system compared to the conventional, fanner practices and control. Organic farming was effective in reducing the genera of PPN below the control for a longer period (4 months) compared to conventional farming and farmer practice (2 months). The findings demonstrated the potential of organic farming in the suppression of PPN at the farmer level. Policy development and extension services can therefore consider organic farming as an alternative method in managing soil-borne nematodes in small holder farms in sub-Saharan Africa. However, further studies are required on other crops, in dry areas and the period to top-dress with organic amendments to assure effective suppression of PPN in organic farming.

Thirty varieties were subjected to two treatments (sole and maize-soybean relay strip intercropping system) with three replications in a complete randomized block design. Light environment characteristics in two cropping systems were measured. At the beginning of the bloom stage of soybean when maize was mature, the soybean stem morphology characteristics stem length, node number, hypocotyl length, internode length, stem diameter, stem breaking strength and stem biomass were measured. The results revealed that the intercropped soybean could capture 13.8% photosynthetic active radiation at the vegetative stage, as compared with the sole crop soybean, with longer soybean main stem, internode and hypocotyl, and lower stem diameter at this stage. The relative value of agronomic traits in the sole and intercropping system could be used to calculate the vining severity index (VI) and the weighted vining index (WVI), and the latter could be used as the comprehensive index of the degree of soybean vining in the relay strip intercropping system. Based on the values of WVI, through the Hierarchical Cluster Analysis, the soybean varieties were divided into the 5 clusters, normal, mild, moderate, severe and extreme vining. Eight of the 30 varieties of soybean were normal vining grade and could be used as the parent plants to breed special varieties for intercropping.

The cropping systems established in the minor seasons, where evaporation exceeds rainfall, were either monocultures of maize (Zea mays L), or maize intercropped with either common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L) or sunhemp (Crotolaria juncea L). In addition, monocultures of two green manures, namely sunhemp (Crotolaria juncea) or Tithonia (Tithonia diversifolia), were established. The residues of maize and beans and the green manures were incorporated at the end of the minor season; at the onset of rains in the major season, maize crops were established on the same plots. Germination of maize was not affected by the previous cropping system. In contrast, crop growth and yields of maize and nitrogen utilization were affected by the previous cropping system. Optimum growth and highest yields were procured in maize that was grown after a green manure crop. Similarly, although the yields were high, the planting of a green manure crop reduced nitrogen utilization by maize in the major season, thereby indicating its potential contribution to sustainability, due to its lower mining of soil nitrogen. On the basis of the results of this two-year study, the impact of cropping systems in minor seasons on the productivity of maize, a very important highland cereal in the tropics, grown under rain-fed conditions in a major season, is presented."

A two factorial design was used. Factor A comprised of pendimethalin application as pre-emergence and no herbicide application. Factor B consisted of four mono-cropping treatments of Zea mays L. (maize), Vigna radiata (L.) R. Wilczek (mungbean), Sesbania sesban (L.) Merr. (sesbania), and Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp. (cowpea), along with six intercropping treatments viz. 5 legumes rows and 6 maize rows in combinations i.e. mungbean+maize, cowpea+maize, sesbania+maize, and also 10 legume crops rows and 6 maize rows in combinations mungbean+maize, cowpea+maize, and sesbania+maize. The results indicated a significant influence of the years, the use of herbicide, the treatments of intercropping, and the interaction effect of the herbicide x intercropping on the yields of studied crops which meant that the differences among the observations were statistically significant. For the year effect, the mean yields were higher in 2014; while for the effect of herbicide use, the maize grain yield was higher in pendimethalin applied plots. Stating the effect of intercropping, mungbean grain yield was highest in plots of mungbean mono-cropping and lowest in mungbean: maize intercropping (sown in ratio of 5:6 rows). Cowpea and sesbania biomasses were significantly higher in herbicide plots and also in mono-cropping plots of cowpea and sesbania plots, respectively in 2014 and 2015. The values of the Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) were between 1.40 and 1.49 for all the intercropping treatments, with the highest LER calculated for sesbaniamaize intercropping (10:6 rows). Therefore, the herbicide pendimethalin as pre-emergence @ 1.5 kg ha(-1) in maize crop along with intercropping of any of the studied legume crops at the 1:1 row sowing ratio is the best combination for achieving desirable weed control, higher crop yields and greater LERs."

Biological pest control could serve as an environmentally friendly ecological control service to suppress crop pests and decrease pesticide use by maintaining or increasing natural enemies. However, few study focus on the explicit process of natural enemies, pest dynamics, quantitative assessment and maintaining mechanism of ecological control service in multi-crop farmland landscape system for the whole crops growing cycle. Here, an experimental model of rotation-intercropping ecosystem via wheat-maize-cotton was planned for three consecutive years to response above questions. Our result found the rotation-intercropping ecosystem help to increase the abundances of the dominant natural enemy, Propylea japonica adults and then promoted aphid reduction in center cotton plots. In crops growing cycle, many predators maintained in wheat from Mid-April to late May, then the predator moved to inhabit in maize before wheat harvest during early June. During the intercropping period of maize and cotton, the predator would prefer to back and forth inhabit in maize and travel to cotton to actively prey on cotton pests. Quantitative evaluation of pest control based on a new built method of Ecological Control Service Index (ESI) found that crop diversity has highly efficient control function in rotation-intercropping ecosystem. The values of ESI at the peak of cotton aphids on center cotton plots were 0.80 in 2012, 0.31 in 2013 and 0.61 in 2014, respectively. The sustainably available prey resources in multi-crops ecosystem and maize as crop habitat with conditions of relative low temperature (28.5 degrees C) and high humidity (68.3 %) are beneficial to maintain the predator natural enemy and ecological control service. Thus, our results suggest that giving full play to the ecological control service of crop diversity in rotation-intercropping ecosystem is beneficial to decrease crop pests and pesticide use, especially under the aggravating agricultural intensification. These findings support growing efforts from landowner, field manager and policy-makers to promote this ecosystem service via designing crops patterns and adjusting crops growing circle in regional agroecosystem.

The effects of competition with maize and interference by maize on dispersal of rust urediniospores were evaluated in trials conducted three times during 1989 and 1990. Alterations in the nondispersal (infection) phase of the pathogen life cycle due to intercropping and competition with maize also were assessed. Overall effects of maize on rust severity were evaluated in another experiment. Competition consistently steepened dispersal gradients (P < 0.10) in trials conducted more than 50 days after planting alone or in combination with interference (intercrop). Interference had no clear effect on dispersal gradients. Estimated total spore deposition per plot was increased (second trial) and decreased (third trial) by competition in both years (P < 0.05). Intercropping only affected infection once, in late 1989, when rust severity was reduced by 96% (P < 0.05). Overall disease was reduced by intercropping at two plot locations in both years (P = 0.07), but not at a third location. Bean leaf area declined because of competition in 1989 but not in 1990. Steep gradients may be due to increased spore escape, and microclimatic changes created by maize are probably responsible for the nondispersal effect.

J	Itulya, FM				Itulya, FM			The influence of intercropping and maize (Zea mays L) inter-row spacing on seed yield of beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L) and maize under semi-arid conditions in Kenya	DISCOVERY AND INNOVATION			English	Article						"cultivars; pods; beans; inter-row spacing; intercropping"		Two experiments were conducted at the National Dryland Research Centre, Katumani, Kenya, during the October, 1984 and March, 1985 rainy seasons. Bean cultivars NE 1122, NE 518, NE 510, NE 1401, NE 26 and Tepary were spaced at 45cmx10cm and intercropped with maize (Katumani Composite ''B'') spaced at 135cmx30cm, 105rmx30cm, 75cmx30cm, and 45cmx30cm in a randomized complete block design. Intercropping and maize inter-row spacing did not significantly influence (P<0.05) the yield components and seed yield of beans. However, increasing maize population in the interculture tended to adversely affect pod yield and seed yield of beans. In October 1984, intercropping significantly (P<0.05) reduced the grain yield of maize intercropped with NE 510 and NE 1401, while inter-row spacing had no significant (P<0.05) influence on the grain yield. Similar reductions (significant at P less than or equal to 0.05) were recorded when maize was intercropped with NE 518, NE 510, NE 26, and NE 1401. No significant effects were noted on maize intercropped with NE 1122 and Tepary bean. Inter-row spacing at 75cm yielded the lowest grain (significant at P<0.05). Except in a few cases, intercropping was beneficial with Land Equivalent Ratio ranging from 1.04 to 1.94. Differences existed between the crops grown in the short rains, 1984, and those grown in the long rains, 1985, with the yield obtained during the long rains being greater than those of short rains, 1984.

Therefore, a three-year field trial was conducted to compare two maize-soybean strip-intercropping planting patterns (two-rows of maize intercropped with two-rows of soybean [2M2S] or -three rows of soybean [2M3S]) were studied with sole maize (SM) and sole soybean (SS) systems. Our results showed that wider-strips of soybean grown as 2M3S had significantly higher leaf area index (LAI; 19%), total dry matter accumulation (TDM; 15%), and grain yield (21%) than the narrower 2M2S strips; this is likely related to the reduced effects of maize shading on soybean. Slightly decreased LAI (4%), TDM (8%), and grain yield (5%) of maize were found in 2M3S. On average, intercropped maize and soybean produced 80% and 52% in 2M2S and 76% and 63% in 2M3S compared to SM and SS yields, respectively, demonstrating the dominance of maize over soybean when intercropped. Similarly, maize was a stronger competitor for water than soybean, with partial water equivalent ratio of 0.81 in 2M2S and 0.78 in 2M3S, while that of soybean was 0.54 in 2M2S and 0.66 in 2M3S. In the intercropping systems, the land equivalent ratio ranged from 1.31 to 1.45, and the water equivalent ratio ranged from 1.32 to 1.49, exhibiting that maize-soybean strip-intercropping is a productive strategy to maximize water use efficiency. The results suggest that the maize-soybean strip-intercropping system may be a productive and sustainable strategy to improve the water use efficiency and land productivity under irrigated conditions. This strategy could benefit agriculture with cleaner, and more efficient production under a global scenario of constrained land and water resources. However, more studies are needed to evaluate the feasibility of intercropping systems in various growing conditions."

Field experiment was performed at two different geographical locations which were Nkakom, Nwabiagya District in the Ashanti region of Ghana and Changchun, Jilin-China during 2017 and 2018 cropping seasons, respectively. The experiment consisted of 4 treatments which were control (no mulch), maize (Zea mays L.) straw-maize, green gram (Vigna radiate)-maize intercrop and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea)-maize intercrops. Measured agronomic parameters were weed biomass, maize yield and legume yields. Green gram-maize intercrop recorded the lowest weed biomass and the control (no mulch) recorded the highest weed biomass. There were no significant differences between maize yields measured. Economic analysis of data was carried out with partial farm budgeting. The highest financial net return was obtained in the green gram-maize intercrop whiles the lowest was recorded in control (no mulch) treatment at the two different geographical locations.

This study simulates the impact of non-uniform irrigation on crop growth and associated nitrogen fluxes. Simulations were applied to a travelling gun irrigation system on a maize crop over a 21-year period. Cropping and intercropping periods were analysed for two fertilisation rates (180 and 280 kg N.ha(-1)). The spatial coefficients of variations over a period of 21 years were below 37, 8, 25 and 34%, for N uptake, mineralised N, inorganic N left in the soil at harvest and leached N, respectively. Simulations with or without reinitialization every year of inorganic N and water content at sowing gave similar results, except in specific years. Differences between high and low fertilisation treatments showed up especially for leaching. Other irrigation and fertilisation strategies should be further analysed to provide more general conclusions.

The maize cultivars were Nancis with erectophile and Sophy wih planophile leaves and the pea cultivars Maro a leafy pea and Princess a semi-leafless pea. In the first part of the season water use was lower for sole maize but intercrops and sole pea used similar amounts of water. By 90 days after sowing, when peas had matured, all crops had used similar amounts of water. Maize had slightly greater water use efficiency than peas. Cultivars Nancis and Princess tended to have greater water use efficiency than Sophy and Maro respectively. Intercrops produced more dry matter than sole crops and therefore had consistently greater water use efficiencies.

It is unclear whether to integrate a multi-technology in the intercropping to achieve a high-yielding, low emission, and high efficiency agricultural integrated production system. In order to assess the crop production and carbon mitigation in integrated system, a field experiment of maize/pea intercropping was performed with two tillage (no-tillage and conventional tillage) and three maize plant density (low density-45,000, medium density-60,000, and high density-75,000 plants ha(-1)) in the oasis irrigation area of northwestern China during the 2016-2018. We found that no-tillage improved crop production and carbon mitigation, increasing maize density was able to improve yield in maize/pea intercropping, but increased the carbon emission. From the 3-year average, the integration of no-tillage and medium plant density (NI2) effectively increased the total grain yield (GY) by 14.5 %, reduced carbon emission by 3.5 % compared to conventional tillage with low maize density (CI1). Meanwhile, this integrated system had increased carbon emission efficiency (CEE) by 16.7 % compared to the CI1. For different crop components in maize/pea intercropping, no-tillage mainly reduced the carbon emission of the maize strip, but no significant effect of pea strip by increasing the maize plant density. In addition, this integrated system also increased net primary production (NPP), net ecosystem production (NEP) and carbon sequestration potential by 17.8, 19.9 and 21.8 % compared with CI1, while had highest economic benefits (average 3.1). Therefore, maize/ pea intercropping compound production pattern integrated no-tillage and medium maize plant density (NI2) should be recommended as the high-efficiency model of farming system for resources saving and reducing carbon emission in oasis irrigation area of northwest China.

Compared to monoculture, soil water balance of intercropped maize was significantly reduced by 115%, while that of alfalfa was dramatically enhanced by 469%. Thus, intercropped maize had pronouncedly reduced root growth by 17-36%, phosphorus uptake by 24%, and yield by 12%, but the associated alfalfa had significantly increased root growth by 26%-175%, phosphorus uptake by 208%, and yield by 137%, leading to significantly improved phosphorus uptake and yield of the composite population. Among root morphological and distribution traits, crown root surface area and lateral root volume were the best predictors of maize and alfalfa phosphorus uptake, respectively.ConclusionsLegume-dominated maize/alfalfa intercropping can significantly improve phosphorus acquisition and yield production through modifications in soil water balance and root morphology and distribution, and the system overyielding was performed via alfalfa rather than maize.

However, the effects of systemic regulation on different plant materials cannot be generalized. In this work, two cultivars of maize (Zea mays L.), 'Rongyu 1210' (RY) and 'Zhongdan 808' (ZD), were selected for a comparative study on the different responses of photosynthesis to light-dependent systemic regulation. After the growth of plants in heterogeneous light, the net photosynthetic rate of newly developed leaves increased in RY but decreased in ZD. A distinct capacity of CO2 fixation and assimilation between these two cultivars is also suggested. In ZD, the area of vascular bundles declined obviously, suggesting a restriction on carbohydrate export, which is also indicated by an increase in starch content. Resulting excessive accumulation of carbohydrates is proposed to inhibit the carbon assimilation, and eventually the photosynthesis. A decline in the area of bundle sheath cells also suggests a restriction on carbon assimilation. In contrast, these restrictions were unlikely to present in RY. This study reveals that the response of leaf photosynthetic performance to light heterogeneity is largely dependent on the systemic regulation of carbon assimilation, as well as carbohydrate export in maize.

In areas facing food insecurity such as Africa, peasants or small-scale farmers have practised intercropping since old times. In this study, an investigation was carried out to determine whether intercropping increased production for small-scale farming in a semi-arid region (Free State, South Africa). Crop productivity of maize and bean intercropping systems was evaluated in terms of yield and growth. The effect of radiation and water utilisation by these systems was measured to determine their productivity. Field trials were carried out during three summer crop growing seasons (plant densities, row orientation and sowing date trials. In all growing seasons, rainfall was below normal, and air temperatures were normal. The total land equivalent ratios for yield and growth ranged between 1.06 to 1.58 and 1.38 to 1.86 respectively, showing yield and growth advantage of intercropping. Concerning radiation and water use, the intercropping of maize and beans had both radiation and water use efficiencies (RUE and WUE, respectively) as high as maize sole cropping, and intercropping RUE and WUE were greater than bean sole cropping. From these results it has been concluded that maize bean intercropping can be recommended to small-scale farmers in this semi-arid region.

Sole cropping for only one year already resulted in significant yield increases for maize and partly for sorghum compared to the conventional cropping of mixed stands of maize-sorghum or maize groundnut and natural fallow. Lowest yield of maize and sorghum was obtained where these cereals followed maize-sorghum (monoculture). Intercropping of maize with groundnut led to subsequent maize and sorghum yields which were similar to those obtained after maize-sorghum. After growing legumes and sunflower for one year the grain and straw yield of maize and sorghum was significantly higher in the two consecutive years than after cereal (maize-sorghum) monoculture. In this trial maize and sorghum were found to be not as tolerant to the disadvantages of monoculture or preceding cereals-legumes mixture. The results suggest that continuous intercropping with cereals under the given conditions has: negative effects on soil fertility and can lead to an increase in soil-borne pests and troublesome weeds like Striga comparable to monocropped cereals.

Disease severity and yield components per cultivar were determined for a subset of the mixtures and also for the pure stands. Disease severity in the mixtures compared to the mean of the components was reduced between 13 and 97%. Changes in disease severity could be separated into two effects. First, selection changed frequencies of the cultivars in the mixtures by up to 35% at harvest compared to the planted frequencies. Reductions in overall disease severity in mixtures due to selection for the more resistant cultivar were as high as 42%, and increases in overall disease severity due to selection for the more susceptible cultivar were as high as 11% over the mean disease severity in the pure stands. Second, disease severity on individual cultivars was reduced below that observed in pure stands because of the epidemiological effect of host diversity. Mixtures yielded between 0 and 5% more than the mean of the pure stands in the absence of disease. In the presence of disease, mixing increased yield between 8 and 13%. Location and year influenced the effects of disease on plant performance indirectly by affecting the competitive abilities of the cultivars.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the photosynthetic response of soybean leaf to the wide light-fluctuation. The data of diurnal variation of photosynthetic characters showed that the photosynthetic rate of intercropped soybean was weaker than that of monocropped soybean. The chlorophyll content, ratio of chlorophyll a/b, and AQE (apparent quantum efficiency) were increased and R-d (dark respiration rate) was decreased for the more efficient interception and absorption of light and carbon gain in intercropping. delta(Ro) (The efficiency/probability with which an electron from the intersystem electron carriers was transferred to reduce end electron acceptors at the PSI acceptor side) and phi(Ro) (the quantum yield for the reduction of the end electron acceptors at the PSI acceptor side) in intercropped soybean leaf were lower compared to those in monocropped one, which showed that the acceptor side of PSI might be inhibited, and also it was the main reason that soybean plants showed a low photosynthetic capacity in intercropping. psi(Eo) (the efficiency/probability with an electron moves further than Q(A)(-)) in monocropping and intercropping decreased 5.8, and 35.7%, respectively, while phi(Eo) (quantum yield for electron transport) decreased 27.7 and 45.3% under the high radiation at noon, which suggested that the acceptor side of PSII was inhibited, while the NPQ became higher. These were beneficial to dissipate excess excitation energy in time, and protect the photosynthetic apparatus against photo-damage. The higher performance index on the absorption basis (PIABS) and lower delta(Ro), phi(Ro), psi(Eo), and phi(Eo) of intercropped soybeans compared to monocropping under high radiation indicated that the electron transfer of intercropped soybean was inhibited more seriously and intercropped soybean adjusted the electron transport between PSII to PSI to adapt the light-fluctuation. Higher NPQ capacity of intercropped soybeans played a key role in keeping the leaf with a better physiological flexibility under the high radiation.

For a better use of land, water, radiation energy, and nutrients, spring wheat is traditionally intercropped with maize (W-M) and, more recently, with sunflower (W-S). Considering the need to reduce diversions of water for irrigation in Hetao, this study aims to assess crop water use of W-M and W-S intercropping systems in comparison to the same crops in monocropping. The dual crop coefficient approach was adopted with the SIMDualKc model, which allows partitioning crop evapotranspiration into crop transpiration and soil evaporation. A new model approach was tested to compute a combined basal crop coefficient for the intercropping, K-cb inter, which uses the daily values of the K-cb of the component crops together with the respective heights and fractions of ground covered by the crops. SIMDualKc was first calibrated and validated for wheat, maize and sunflower as single crops using field data of 2010-2012 and was later used with the new developed approach, which was validated with W-M and W-S field data of 2010-2011. The K-cb values calibrated for wheat, maize and sunflower compared well with literature and goodness of fit indicators have shown high accuracy of simulations used for calibration and validation. Results evidenced the importance of groundwater contribution in Hetao, and that soil evaporation is there low under surface irrigation. Moreover, it was found that actual evapotranspiration, crop transpiration, irrigation water use and groundwater contribution of intercropping systems were larger than those of the component sole crops, which led to significantly higher yields of intercropping relative to those of single crops.

Iron acquisition of graminaceous plants is characterized by the synthesis and secretion of the iron-chelating phytosiderophores. Compared to the roots of monocropped maize, the roots of maize intercropped with peanut always secreted higher amounts of phytosiderophores during peanut anthesis. For non-graminaceous plants, reduction of ferric to ferrous iron on the root surface is the rate-limiting step for mobilizing iron from soil. The full-length cDNA, AhFRO1, which is encoding an Fe(III)-chelate reductase, was isolated from peanut. AhFRO1 expression in yeast conferred Fe(III)-chelate reductase activity to the cells. Consistent with its function in iron uptake, AhFRO1 was determined to be a membrane protein by transient expression analysis. AhFRO1 mRNA accumulated under iron deficiency conditions. During pre-anthesis, the Fe(III)-chelate reductase activity and the transcript levels of AhFRO1 were similar in monocropped and intercropped peanut. When the iron deficiency-induced chlorosis developed in the monocropped peanuts, both the Fe(III)-chelate reductase activity of peanut and the transcript levels of AhFRO1 were higher in intercropped than in monocropped peanuts, which is consistent with the secretion of phytosiderophores by maize roots. We conclude that AhFRO1 in peanut and phytosiderophores from maize co-operate to improve the iron nutrition of peanut when intercropped with maize.

The experimental design was a randomized complete block design in a 2x3 factorial scheme composed of the use of pigeon pea and three forage seeding densities (seed bank, 0 kg ha(-1), 2 kg ha(-1) and 4 kg ha(-1)), with 4 replicates. The number of spikes per plant, height of insertion of the first spike, plant height, number of rows per spike, number of grains per row, weight of one hundred grains, maize grain yield, maize fresh mass yield, dry mass yield of maize, Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu, and pigeon pea. The results demonstrate that the seeds present in the seed bank of the degraded areas are viable to recover the pasture through the consortium.

Their activity and contribution to biocontrol may increase in response to more complex agricultural habitats. In this study, we investigated the effects of winter wheat-pea mixed intercropping on the biocontrol potential of generalist predators compared with the respective mono-crops. We evaluated not only the effects during the intercropping season but also the pre-crop values of the mixture for the subsequent barley crop. Furthermore, we evaluated the influence of different long-term soil organic carbon and fertility management regimes on activity and biocontrol potential of predators. Field work was conducted over two seasons in a field experiment located in Gembloux, Belgium. A set of proxies for ecosystem functions were measured using the Rapid Ecosystem Function Assessment approach. We measured attack and predation rates of sentinel prey and weed seeds artificially placed in the field. Furthermore, we assessed activity density of the main groups of generalist predators during the exposure of the baits. Our results showed that crop type affected activity and biocontrol potential of predators. Predation rates were much lower in wheat than pea and wheat-pea. The mixture wheat-pea had a positive effect on predator activity density compared to wheat mono-crop, while pea supported an intermediate activity of epigeal predators. In the second season of the field work, we found the highest biocontrol potential by predators in barley plots cultivated after pea. Finally, our results failed to find any differences in biocontrol potential of predators between long-term soil organic carbon and fertilisation management strategies. These results suggest that crop type has a major relevance in influencing the activity of generalist predators, and the mixed intercropping wheat-pea may represent a valid strategy to enhance biological pest control in comparison to wheat cultivated as mono-crop. Furthermore, we show that the cultivation of pea as mono-crop may have an important pre-crop value within the rotation increasing the provision of ecosystem services such as biocontrol.

There are a range of climate-smart systems that have been proposed and conservation agriculture (CA) based on minimum soil disturbance, crop residue retention and crop rotation is one of them. A CA trial established in 2007 in Malawi was used during cropping-seasons 2015-2016 (El Nino) and 2016-2017 (La Nina) to assess the performance and resistance of different CA maize systems under climate-related stress at anthesis, a climate sensitive growth stage. Large in-situ rainout shelters were used to simulate increased daytime temperatures and in-season droughts of 18-19 days and 27 days. CA systems better resisted climate stress around anthesis than conventional tillage practices as CA systems showed greater resistance to drought than conventional practice. This was expressed by higher CA maize grain yields, biomass yields or harvest index under conditions of natural (El Nino) or 19 day simulated drought. However, under 27 day drought simulation the resistance benefit of CA was no-longer significant. Crop diversification improved the resistance of CA systems to climate stress, more so when diversification was over time (rotation) than in space (intercropping). In all years CA systems substantially out yielded conventional practice, this highlights the benefits of medium-term (eight years) CA management before the rainout shelter experiment started. Our results from natural and simulated drought conditions confirm that CA systems can increase adaptive capacity to an increased risk of climate stress associated with projected global climate change. We show that large-scale rainout shelters are a useful means of accelerating our understanding of how long-term agricultural management practices can enhance resistance to climate stresses.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze the effect of the spatial arrangement of maize and beans regard its distribution of aerial biomass and roots, photosynthetically active radiation in the canopy and grain production of both species. This research was carried out in the year 2012; at the experimental field Valley de Mexico Zea mays L. ('H-155') and P vulgaris L. ('Negro 8025') were intercropped. The arrangement was maize (MM) and bean (FF) in simple cultures, two furrows of maize intercropped with two of bean (MMFF) and an alternate with each species (MFMF). An ANOVA and means comparison (DMS; p <= 0.05) were assessed from the resulting data using SAS' software version 9.00. The highest maize yield (p=0.014) arose when it was intercropped, the MFMF treatment had more exploration area with root presence (7861 cm(2)) and lateral roots (186 cm2). The MM treatments had less maize grain yield (p <= 0.05) compared to the intercropping arrangements, as they had the lowest photosynthetically active radiation at the ground level (RFAts) and their roots had less side soil exploration. Beans in MFMF had 38 % less area with root presence and high RFAts values respect to the simple crops, which decreased the biomass since the pre-flowering, the leaf area index in grain filling and yield grain. The beans at the MMFF treatments increased its biomass and yield grain, as the basal leaves got more RFA. The soil relative efficiency was 1.12 in the MMFF treatment and 1.07 in the MFMF."

J	"Gaiser, T; de Barros, I; Lange, FM; Williams, JR"				"Gaiser, T; de Barros, I; Lange, FM; Williams, JR"			Water use efficiency of a maize/cowpea intercrop on a highly acidic tropical soil as affected by liming and fertilizer application	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						"acid soils; cowpea; maize; fertilization; liming; water use efficiency; soil water balance models"	"NITROGEN; NIGER"	Due to global warming, there is a need to increase the water use efficiency of crops under rainfed agriculture, particularly in semi-arid regions. Therefore, the effect of NPK fertilizer application (with or without liming) on the water use efficiency of a maize/cowpea intercropping system was investigated in the semi-arid part of Brazil. The crops were grown on a strongly acidic, sandy soil with three treatments: (i) Complete NPK fertilizer application with lime (Compl), (ii) Complete NPK fertilizer application without lime (Compl-L) and (iii) Control. On the average, dry matter production was 2.6 times higher with the Compl treatment than in the Control and 1.6 times higher than in the Compl-L treatment. The soil water balance was calculated with two different model approaches (HILLFLOW and EPICSEAR). When checked against measured soil water content during the growing period, both models produced accurate results, but only EPICSEAR was sensitive to the effects of liming and fertilizer application on soil water balance and dry matter production at this site. Comparison between the Compl and the Compl-L treatments shows that the increase in transpirational water use efficiency (WUET) (+63 and +80%, respectively) is mainly due to the application of NPK. Although the site is highly acid, liming was of minor importance for increasing the WUET. However, observations and simulations demonstrate that, through the additional application of lime, the gross water use efficiency (WUEC) in a maize/cowpea intercropping system can be increased by 60% compared to sole application of NPK and by more than 160% compared to the control.

Intercropping has been shown to enhance crop productivity. However, Intercropping generally requires more input that led to an increase in CO2 emissions. It is unknown whether designing tillage and film mulching in reduction could decrease soil CO2 emissions in intercropping. Therefore, we integrated no tillage combined with residual film mulching and straw returning into wheat-maize intercropping. The maximal soil CO2 fluxes (F-s) with intercropping was decreased by 12-21% compared to sole maize. Residual film mulching combined with straw returning (NTSMI) significantly reduced average F-s during the entire period of crop growth by 14-15%, compared with the conventional tillage (CTI). Soil CO2 emissions (CE) with intercropping was 18-20% less than that with sole maize and the NTSMI reduced CE by 12-16% compared to the CTI. The NTSMI boosted total grain yields (GY) by 14-17%, compared with the CTI. Wheat-maize intercropping significantly enhanced soil CO2 emission efficiency (CEE) by 33-41% in comparison to sole maize, and CEE with NTSMI was increased by 29-40% than that of CTI. A quadratic function for aboveground biomass (BA) combined with two linear functions for soil temperature (T-s) and soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) was suitable for the monitored results. A multiple regression model composed of the above three factors can explain 73-91% of the F-s variation. Crop biomass accumulation at the time of maximal F-s was less with intercropping compared with sole maize. The structural equation indicated that the BA synergistic effect on CEE through combining negative effects on CE and positive effects on GY in intercropping. In conclusion, no tillage with straw returning and residual film mulching in wheat-maize intercropping was confirmed to be an optimum management practice to reducing soil CO2 emissions and enhancing soil CO2 emission efficiency in arid inland agroecosystem.

Intercropping can increase per-unit farmland productivity through a resource efficient utilization. However, the fate of N in intercropping systems remains unclear. To study he yield advantages and the fate of N in additive maize-soybean relay intercropping (IMS) systems, we quantified crop yield, soil N transformation abilities, soil bacterial abundances, and the fate of N-15. This study was conducted using three planting patterns, namely, monoculture maize (Zea mays L.) (MM), monoculture soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) (MS), and IMS, and two N application rates, specifically, no N and applied N (N-1, 45 and 135 kg N ha(-1) for MS and MM, correspondingly; and N for the IMS, which was the sum of the monocultures). Results showed that a higher per-unit farmland productivity and a lower land use intensity are attained in the intercropping system than in the corresponding monocultures, In addition, land equivalent ratio (LER) ranges from 1.85 to 2.20. Moreover, the fate of N-15 showed that the N uptake and residual are the highest, whereas N loss in the MS is the lowest among all planting patterns. Intercropping had an increased N use efficiency by increasing N utilization efficiency, rather than N uptake efficiency. The abundance of ammonia oxidizer and denitrifier indicated that IMS improves the structure of soil microorganisms. Furthermore, the transformation abilities of soil N denoted that intercropping strengthens ammonifying and nitrifying capacities to increase soil N residual while decreasing ammonia volatilization and N2O emission. Finally, the greenhouse warming potential and gas intensity of N2O were significantly lower in the IMS than in the corresponding monocultures. In summary, the IMS system provides an environmentally friendly approach to increasing farmland productivity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Legume intercrops are a source of plant N that can be produced locally and offer a practical complement to inorganic Fertilizers. Field experiments conducted on a loamy sand (Typic Kandiustalf) soil evaluated the impact of relay-intercropping two legume crops, cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) and sunnhemp (Crotolaria juncea L.) into smallholder maize in Zimbabwe. The objectives were to quantify: (i) biomass and N yield of intercropped legumes, (ii) the impact of the legumes on companion maize yield and N uptake, and (iii) the response of a subsequent maize crop to legumes. Dry matter yield ranged from 0.6 to 4.6 Mg ha(-1) for cowpea and 0.9 to 2.9 Mg ha(-1) for sunnhemp, over two years. At the most, cowpea and sunnhemp produced 154 and 82 kg N ha(-1), respectively. Companion maize grain yields were not reduced when the legumes were relay-intercropped into maize fertilized at 0 to 60 kg N ha(-1). However, maize yields were reduced 18 to 31% when maize + legume intercrops were fertilized at 120 kg N ha(-1). In the subsequent year, maize gain yields were increased by 8 to 27% following maize + legume when no fertilizer N was applied, compared with maize following maize. Legumes reduced fertilizer needs of a subsequent maize crop by 36 kg N ha(-1). Intercropped annual legumes and small amounts of inorganic Fertilizer offers a strategy to meet the N needs on smallholder farms.

The treatment on the runoff plots were sole maize, maize intercropped with beans and maize intercropped with cowpeas and barefallow as a control. The objective was to determine the effectiveness of intercropping in minimizing soil and runoff losses. Sole maize was found to have significantly higher soil and runoff losses than the two intercrops. It is recommended that maize should always be intercropped with low growing crops like beans and cowpeas, especially if planted on Dystric Nitosols.

However, there are few studies focusing on C-4-specific processes. In the present study, two cultivars of maize (Zea mays L.), 'Rongyu 1210' (RY) and 'Zhongdan 808' (ZD), were treated with heterogeneous light (HL). The net photosynthetic rate (Pn) of newly developed leaves was found to increase in HL-treated RY, while it decreased in HL-treated ZD. Result also showed a negative correlation between the Pn and the content of malate, a key metabolite in C-4 photosynthesis, in these two cultivars. In HL-treated ZD, malate content increased with a decline in the abundance of NADP-malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40), suggesting that less malate was decarboxylated. Moreover, a restriction of malate diffusion is proposed in HL-treated ZD, since the interface length between mesophyll cells (MC) and bundle sheath cells (BSC) decreased. In contrast, malate diffusion and subsequent decarboxylation in HL-treated RY should be stimulated, due to an increase in the abundance of NADP-malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.82) and a decline in the content of malate. In this case, malate diffusion from MC to BSC should be systemically stimulated, thereby facilitating C-4 photosynthesis of a maize leaf in heterogeneous light. While if it is systemically restricted, C-4 photosynthesis would be suppressed.

The two systems were managed in a similar manner. Germination, establishment and growth of plants, and yield parameters of mungbean within the maize crop were reduced to a greater extent than that of plants grown with cassava. In addition, in both systems, growth and yields of mungbean plants in close promixity to the non-legume were suppressed to a greater degree than in plants in the centre rows. In contrast, nodulation and nodule activity of plants in close promixity to maize or cassava was higher than in that of centre rows. The study revealed that shading of mungbean plants in dose proximity to maize and cassava does not reduce nodule activity. While competitive relationships between the non-legume and mungbean could affect the growth and yields of the legume plants in dose promixity, the greater utilisation of nitrogen by the non-legume is suggested to be the causal factor for increased nodule activity.

Brachiaria); seeding rate; crop-livestock integration"	"LIVESTOCK INTEGRATION SYSTEM; NO-TILLAGE SYSTEM; CORN; SELECTIVITY; HERBICIDES; YIELD"	In intercropping competition among species for environmental resources can cripple the system. The amount of interference of one species over another as a result of this competition depends on the species population density which composed the system. In the search for better understanding these effects it was evaluated the effects of U. brizantha densities on forage growth and nutritional efficiency and productivity of maize in intercropping system. The treatments were randomized in blocks with four replications. The DHB 390 RR corn was sown at a spacing of 0.50m in the population of 60.000 plants ha(-1), with the planting of brachiaria performed manually in rows. Nutritional assessments were performed at 60 after planting the species (DAP) and grain yield of maize and dry weight was measured for brachiaria 160 DAP. The dry matter brachiaria presented quadractricaly behaviour with the increasing planting density. The increased density of U. brizantha resulted in a linear reduction of the levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium and magnesium in maize plants, however, without changing the levels of potassium and sulfur. Grain yield was negatively affected in density of more than 15 plants m(-2) brachiaria. It is concluded that the interference of U. brizantha on corn planting simultaneously, reduces the levels of phosphorus, calcium and magnesium independent of density. Grain yield and total nitrogen were reduced by brachiaria densities higher than 15 plants m(-2).

Previous studies indicated that leguminous crops can promote P absorption by neighboring gramineous crops. In this study, we isolated and screened the phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) from soybean rhizosphere under a maize-soybean intercropping system in Southwest China, and nine PSBs with high P-solubilizing ability were identified. RESULTS 16S rDNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed that these PSBs belong mainly to Bacillus and Pseudomonas. The phosphate solubility of Bacillus aryabhattai B8W22 reached 388.62 mu g mL(-1). High-performance liquid chromatographic analysis showed that each strain could secrete a large quantity of organic acids, including oxalic acid, malonic acid, citric acid and succinic acid. In addition, all strains produced indole acetic acid (IAA) and siderophores that could promote plant growth. Seed germination experiments testified that PSBs isolated in this study have an innate ability to promote plant growth. The plant culture pot experiment further illustrated that soil acid phosphatase (ACP) activity and available P content, as well as plant P uptake, increased significantly with PSBs inoculation. CONCLUSION PSBs from the rhizosphere soil of intercropped soybean could secrete organic acids that increase the solubilization of unavailable P, improve soil ACP activity and P availability, and produce IAA and siderophores that promote maize seed germination and seedling growth. Our findings indicate the PSBs from soybean rhizosphere have significant potential to reduce the application of chemical phosphate fertilizers and to promote sustainable agricultural development.

Intercropping of maize + horsegram [Macrotyloma uniflorum (Lam.) Verdic.] in 1 : 1 ratio significantly reduced the density and dry weight of weeds, and gave maximum maize-equivalent yield (39.2 q/ha), net return (Rs 4,097/ha) and net gain/rupee invested (Rs 1.08) compared with maize + blackgram (Phaseolus mungo L.) and maize + soybean [Glycine mar (L.)

Intercropping improves total productivity of food and feed crops through efficient utilization of land resource and farming inputs. The objective of under-sowing lablab (Lablab purpureus L.) in maize (Zea mays) field was to evaluate biological yield and parthenium (Parthenium hysterophorus L.) control during 2018-2020 at research substation of ArbaMinch on a sandy-loam soil and rainfall of 1103 mm. The treatments: sole-maize(M0), sole-lablab(L0), similar day planting(ML0), planting lablab ten days after maize(ML10), twenty days(ML20), thirty days(ML30) and forty days(ML40) were laid out in randomized complete block design with three replications. Growth, yield and yield components, biological competition of intercrops and weed invasion of the plots were assessed for intercrop combinations of maize and lablab. Higher(P < 0.01) plant height and branch number of lablab were recorded at ML10, leaf to stem ratio of lablab was higher at L0 while all parameters value was lower at ML0. Higher biomass yield (46.89 t/ha) was recorded at ML10, grain yield (7.73 t/ha) at M0 and dry matter yield (14.56 t/ha) at L0. Land equivalent ratio (LER) showed 80.1% efficient at ML10 followed by ML20 (79.2%) while lower at ML40 (35.7%) and the highest monetary advantage value (MVI) was 12,084.00ETB at ML10 followed by ML20. Lablab demonstrated the highest suppressing ability over weed density at ML0. Planting lablab 10-20 days after maize proves efficient land use and profitability.

A survey was conducted during the 2017 and 2018 cropping seasons to determine the distribution, relative importance, and the association between S. frugiperda intensity and biophysical factors. A total of 375 maize fields were surveyed during the two cropping seasons. The spatiotemporal analysis revealed that there was a 100% prevalence of the S. frugiperda with various degrees in both cropping seasons. However, significant variations were observed in the pest incidence and plant damage severity of S. frugiperda among the surveyed districts in the two seasons. There were higher pest incidence and plant damage severity in 2017 than in the 2018 cropping season. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the association of S. frugiperda with biophysical factors. Higher (> 75% for both cropping seasons) S. frugiperda plant damage severity was highly associated with Denba Gofa, Zala, Arba Minch, cropping system, altitude, pest management, insecticide spray frequency, and weeding practice with variable levels of significance. Lower plant damage severity of S. frugiperda was highly associated with Burji, high intercropping, altitude, a cultural plus insecticide used in pest management, more than two times insecticide applications, and high weeding practice. The study suggests proper pest management practices should be carried out to reduce S. frugiperda damaged to the maize crop.

Inoculation increased grain yield of both maize (Zea maya L.) and mungbean (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek). Yield of maize increased by 60% in the sole crop and 71% in the intercrop as the N application rate was increased from 0 to 90 kg/ha, with a corresponding decrease of 29-35% in the yield of the associated mungbean. Intercropping reduced mungbean yield by 35-57%; maize was less affected. Inoculation also improved the land equivalent ratio (LER). The highest LER (1.49) was obtained at 30 kg N/ha with inoculation. Nutrient absorption by both maize and mungbean was reduced due to intercropping, mungbean being more affected than maize. The reductions in the N absorption efficiency of maize ranged from 4 to 37% and those of mungbean from 37 to 58%. Increases in N rate increased N absorption of maize but caused greater reductions in N absorption of mungbean. Reductions in P absorption by intercropped maize declined with increases in applied N and with inoculation. Inoculation, however, had a lesser effect on K absorption efficiency. Land equivalent ratio analysis in terms of N, P and K utilization efficiency showed that the increase in LER over unity was due largely to a higher total uptake of nutrients by the component crops in the mixture than by the sole crops. The greater efficiency of intercrops than of the sole crops in converting absorbed nutrients to grains also contributed to the yield advantage."

The present study aimed to investigate contribution of the relative importance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and root exudates in short-term N transfer. Methods A field experiment was conducted to explore N transfer from alfalfa to maize under two different N application levels using N-15 leaf labeling. Results N transfer amount ranged from 7 to 10 mg N plant(-1) from alfalfa to maize and significantly decreased (by 11%-22%) with N fertilizer application. Intercropping of 4 rows of maize and 6 rows of alfalfa with 30 cm intra-row spacing (IMA43) was the optimal intercropping mode, which increased N transfer, total N uptake and yield by 18%, 15% and 11%, respectively. The relative importance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and root exudates on N transfer was dependent on soil N availability. Under no N addition, hyphal length density (HLD) of rhizosphere soil explained the largest significant amount (50%) of the variability in N transfer and crop yield. However, root exudates explained 77% of the variability in N transfer and crop yields with N fertilizer application. Conclusions Our findings highlighted that N transfer is reliant more on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi than root exudates in N-deficient soil, whereas root exudates play a more important role in N-fertilized soil.

Oviposition was not affected by intercropping, but significantly fewer larvae and pupae were found in the intercrop. Egg parasitism was significantly higher in the intercrop reaching as high as 80% and was positively density dependent. Larval and pupal parasitism remained between 3 and 20%, but neither of these were affected by intercropping or host density. The main predators, ants and wandering spiders, were not augmented by intercropping, but an inverse relationship in abundance was found between these two predator groups. It is concluded that maize intercropped with cowpea has only limited potential as a method of controlling the key pests in maize.

An experiment was carried out in three consecutive cropping seasons (2012-2015) with four treatments: sole maize; sole maize with plastic mulch; maize and cowpea under plastic mulching; and maize and soybean under plastic mulching in randomized block design (RBD) to assess their impact on productivity, profitability, and resource (rainwater, soil, and NPK nutrients) conservation in the Indian sub-Himalayan region. The plot size was 9 x 8.1 m with 2% slope, and runoff and soil loss were measured using a multi-slot devisor. The results showed that mean runoff decreased from 356 mm in sole maize with plastic mulch plots to 229 mm in maize + cowpea intercropping with plastic mulch, representing a reduction of 36% and corresponding soil loss reduction was 41% (from 9.4 to 5.5 t ha(-1)). The eroded soil exported a considerable amount of nitrogen (N) (13.2-31.4 kg ha(-1)), phosphorous (P) (0.5-1.7 kg ha(-1)), and potassium (K) (9.9-15.6 kg ha(-1)) and was consistently lower in maize + cowpea intercropping. The maize equivalent yield (MEY) was significantly higher in maize + cowpea with plastic mulch intercropping than the other treatments. These results justify the need to adopt maize with alternate legume intercrops and plastic mulch. This strategy must be done in a way guaranteeing high yield stability to the smallholder farmers of the Indian sub-Himalayan region."

Effect of Combined Application of Poultry Manure and Inorganic Fertiliser on Yield and Yield Components of Maize Intercropped with Soybean	PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF TROPICAL AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article							PRODUCTIVITY	A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of the combined application of poultry manure and inorganic fertiliser on yield and the yield component of maize (Zea mays L) and soybean (Glycine max L. Merril) intercrops. Treatments comprised combinations of three intercropping systems (sole maize, sole soybean and maize+soybean) and four nutrient management practices [control, 100% NPK, 100% poultry manure (PM) and 50 % NPK+50% PM]. The experiment was laid out in a randomised complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. The results revealed that intercropping of maize with soybean significantly reduced soybean yield and yield components, but maize yield and yield traits were not significantly affected by intercropping. Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) was > 1, indicating a beneficial effect of intercropping soybean with maize. For both maize and soybean, there were no significant differences in yield between application of 100% NPK and the 50% NPK+50% PM fertiliser. A combined application of 50% NPK and 50% PM gave the highest monetary advantage in intercropping system. It can be concluded that a 50% substitution of inorganic fertiliser with poultry manure is recommended to reduce use of chemical fertilisers without sacrificing crop yield.	"[Almaz, M. G.; Halim, R.

Here, we present field experimental data on yield and yield components of maize hybrid cultivars under intercropping system. These cultivars differ in plant heights (i.e. Zhengdan958 with plant height of 270 cm, Xianyu335 of 325 cm, Huayi5 of 330 cm, and Xundan20 of 273 cm) and were planted in 8 different intercropping configurations, along with 6 sole cropping treatments in two years. Yield advantages of 0.15-1.7 t ha(-1) were detected under maize hybrid intercropping treatments as compared to sole cropping treatments in one year. Seasonal climate variation and hybrid configuration influenced the interspecific interactions between hybrid cultivars, resulting in different increase of grain yield. Cultivar Zhengdan958 had a lower grain yield per plant and thousand kernel weight under intercropping comparing to sole cropping, while cultivars Xianyu335 and Huayi5 under intercropping increased grain yield per plant and thousand kernel weight, resulting in a land equivalent ratio greater than 1. Additionally, the land equivalent ratio was positively and significantly (P < 0.01) correlated with border effects. This study indicates that there is potential for yield improvement of maize hybrids through intercropping system in China, and the land equivalent ratio was affected by hybrids used in intercropping and seasonal climate variation.

Relay intercropping has advantages for yield, but a strategy for N management is urgently required to decrease N inputs without yield loss in maize-soybean relay intercropping systems (IMS). Experiments were conducted with three levels of N and three planting patterns, and dry matter accumulation, nitrogen uptake, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), competition ratio (CR), system productivity index (SPI), land equivalent ratio (LER), and crop root distribution were investigated. Our results showed that the CR of soybean was greater than 1, and that the change in root distribution in space and time resulted in an interspecific facilitation in IMS. The maximum yield of maize under monoculture maize (MM) occurred with conventional nitrogen (CN), whereas under IMS, the maximum yield occurred with reduced nitrogen (RN). The yield of monoculture soybean (MS) and of soybean in IMS both reached a maximum under RN. The LER of IMS varied from 1.85 to 2.36, and the SPI peaked under RN. Additionally, the NUE of IMS increased by 103.7% under RN compared with that under CN. In conclusion, the separation of the root ecological niche contributed to a positive interspecific facilitation, which increased the land productivity. Thus, maize-soybean relay intercropping with reduced N input provides a very useful approach to increase land productivity and avert environmental pollution.

In this study, a four-year fixed-field experiment was carried out in northeast China with three treatments: continuous cropping of maize, continuous cropping of peanuts and rotational strip intercropping of maize and peanut. The results show that crop rotation improved the main-stem height, branch number, lateral branch length, and yield and quality of peanuts; the yield was the highest in 2018, when it was increased by 39.5%. RSI improved the contents of total N, available N, total P, available P, total K and available K; the content of available N was the highest in 2018, with an increase of 70%. Rhizosphere soil urease and catalase activities were significantly increased and were the highest in 2017, reaching 183.13% and 91.21%, respectively. According to a high-throughput sequencing analysis, the rhizosphere soil bacterial richness and specific OTUs decreased in peanut rhizosphere soil, while the fungal increased. There were differences in the bacterial and fungal community structures; specifically, the abundance of Acidobacteria and Planctomycetes increased among bacteria and the abundance of beneficial microorganisms such as Ascomycota increased among fungi. In conclusion, rotational strip intercropping of maize and peanut increased the yield and quality of peanuts and conducive to alleviating the obstacles facing the continuous cropping of peanuts. Among then, soil physicochemical properties, enzyme activity and microbial diversity were significantly affected the yield of peanut."

Effect of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) intercropping on weed biomass and maize (Zea mays) yield	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF CROP AND HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						"integrated weed management; sowing date; plant density; cover crop; living mulch"	"PLANTING DENSITY; HAIRY VETCH; CEREAL RYE; MANAGEMENT; CROP; INTERFERENCE; SUPPRESSION; WHEAT; CORN; SOIL"	"Field experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) density (0, 15 or 30 plants/m(2)) and sowing date (15 days prior to maize sowing or simultaneously with maize), and of maize (Zea mays) planting density (7.5 or 9 plants/m(2)) on weed biomass and maize crop yield. Results showed that increasing the maize density from 7.5 to 9 plants/m(2) reduced the weed biomass by 21.5%. Furthermore, cowpea acted as a living mulch, reducing weed biomass by up to 45.5% and 39.6% when intercropped with maize at a density of 7.5 and 9 plants/m(2), respectively. Under weed-free conditions, an increase in maize density from 7.5 to 9 plants/m(2) resulted in maize grain yield increasing from 8.92 to 9.40 t/ha; however, the addition of cowpea only increased the maize grain yield by about 4.2%, on average, under these conditions. By contrast, under weed-infested conditions, there was a large decrease in maize grain yield (up to 32%), but intercropping with cowpea reduced this to only a 16% decrease. Under weed-free conditions, there was no effect of sowing date on maize grain yield; however, under weed-infested conditions, yield was greater on the second sowing date. Thus, it is concluded that the planting of maize at a density of 9 plants/m(2) and simultaneously intercropping with cowpea at a density of 30 plants/m(2) could be an appropriate control measure for weed suppression."

The results showed that as the wheat coverage rate decreased, the quantities of immigrating winged aphids and their natural enemies significantly differed; the population densities of the natural enemies of wheat aphids continuously rose and reached the highest levels in the 4:2 intercropping. During the stable periods, the maximum population density of wheat aphids was the highest in monoculture wheat. With a reduction in the wheat coverage ratio, the maximum population density of wheat aphids showed a decreasing trend. The control imposed by predatory natural enemies in intercropped wheat was higher than that in monoculture wheat; it was strongest in the 8:2 intercropping and the lowest in wheat monoculture. With an increase in the proportion of wheat, the parasitism rate of parasitic wasps increased gradually and reached the highest level in 4:2 intercropping. The effect of host density on hyperparasitism was significant in the intercropped wheat. The intercropping pattern had a great effect on the wheat aphids' natural enemies. In different agricultural landscapes, the diversity of wheat aphids' natural enemies differed significantly between intercropped wheat and monoculture wheat; in the heterogeneous landscape, the natural enemy diversity was highest in intercropped wheat, and it was far higher than that in the other wheat cultivation patterns. The natural enemy diversity was also slightly different between monoculture wheat in the heterogeneous landscape and intercropped wheat in the homogeneous agricultural landscape."

Maize and pigeon pea sole crop and intercrop nutrient response functions for Tanzania	NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						"Eastern Africa; Fertilizer use optimization; Intercrop"	"NITROGEN; AFRICA; SYSTEMS"	"Low soil fertility constrains crop productivity in Tanzania. Fertilizer recommendations were lacking for pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.) sole crop (PPSC) and intercrop. Trials were conducted in eastern and northern Tanzania to determine: maize (Zea mays L.) (MSC), PPSC and intercrop (MzPpI) nutrient response functions; the agronomic and economic efficiency for applied nutrients; other nutrient deficiencies; and a means of calculating MzPpI response functions from MSC functions. The treatment structure allowed for determination of MSC and MzPpI response functions for N, P and K and of PPSC functions for P and K. Overall mean PPSC yield was 2.31 Mg ha(-1) with a 12% increase due to applied P. Yield of MSC was increased by N only and of MzPpI by N and P, although intercropped pigeon pea yield was not affected by nutrient application. Yields were not increased with K, Mg, S, Zn, and B application. Yield of MzPpI, as maize grain value equivalent, was more than with MSC but response to N were similar. The agronomic efficiency of fertilizer N at the economically optimal rate (EOR) for MSC was 32 kg kg(-1). The EOR of N were similar for MSC and MzPpI and was on average 27 kg ha(-1) less for the most compared with the least costly fertilizer N scenario with 3% less yield with the lower EOR. The coefficients for MzPpI N and P response functions can be estimated from MSC functions, hence reducing field research requirements for optimization of fertilizer use for MzPpI."

The recent occurrence of fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (JE Smith) a new invasive pest in Africa, has escalated the problem. Push-pull technology (PPT), proven to be effective for stemborers (Chilo partellus Swinhoe and Busseola fusca Fuller) and the parasitic weed striga (Striga hermontica Delile) management in Africa has been shown to provide good control of FAW. This study investigated if intercropping maize with edible legumes can also reduce the abundance of FAW. Six treatments including (i) climate-smart PPT, (ii) conventional PPT, (iii) maize intercropped with bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), (iv) maize intercropped with soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], (v) maize intercropped with groundnut [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] and, (vi) mono-cropped maize were evaluated on farm in six districts of Uganda in the 2017 short rains season. Data collected included FAW, stemborer, and striga infestation symptoms, and severity of infestation. Climate-smart PPT performed best in reducing stemborer, FAW, and striga infestation followed by conventional PPT over all the phenological stages of maize. Intercropping of maize with leguminous crops also provided significant reduction of stemborer and FAW compared to mono-cropped maize, especially in the early growth phases of the maize up to tasseling. However, intercropping of maize with edible legumes was not very effective for striga management as compared to PPT. Hence in addition to PPT, intercropping of maize with edible legumes could also be an alternative FAW management option when integrated with other sustainable management measures.

Performance of maize (Zea mays)-based intercropping systems and their residual effect on wheat (Triticum aestivum) plus lentil (Lens culinaris) intercropping system under organic conditions	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article								A field experiment was conducted on a silty clay loam soil of Palampur during 2011-12 and 2012-13, to study performance of maize (Zea mays L.)-based intercropping systems and their residual effect on wheat [Triticum aestivum (L.) emend. Fiori & Paol.] + lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus) intercropping under organic conditions. Growth, yield attributes, grain and stover yields of maize were more in sole stand. Intercropping systems resulted in significantly higher grain-maize-equivalent yield than sole stand. Maize + soybean (Glycine max) in both additive and paired series resulted in higher maize-equivalent yield than the other intercrops and resulted in better yield of both maize and soybean crops and proved to be the best intercropping system with a net returns of 868,807 and (sic)65,078 and net returns/rupee invested of (sic)1.13 and (sic)1.08 respectively. However, wheat and lentil on residual basis showed more yield on intercropping treatment than sole maize. Wheat recorded the highest yield when sown under soybean and ricebean treatment both in additive and paired series, whereas lentil recorded the highest grain yield when sown under asparagus bean (Vigna unguiculata sesquipedalis) additive series and was statistically at par with cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] in paired series. The highest available nitrogen was recorded in maize + soybean in paired and additive series, whereas the lowest available nitrogen in sole maize. Among the intercrops, soybean fixed more N followed by ricebean (Vigna umbellata), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and asparagus bean (Vigna unguiculata sesquipedalis). Higher values of available Phosphorus (10.5 kg/ha) and Potassium (228.1 kg/ha) was recorded in sole maize.

This study aimed to evaluate the soil water dynamics and the crop yield performance in maize and Brachiaria ruziziensis intercropping under different sowing densities of the forage grass. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design, with treatments associated to the sowing densities (2 kg ha(-1), 4 kg ha(-1), 6 kg ha(-1) and 8 kg ha(-1)) and the single cropping for both species as controls. The maize plants were evaluated for grain yield and B. ruziziensis for number of plants per hectare and shoot fresh and dry matter. The intercropping performance was evaluated using the land- use efficiency index. The soil water dynamics was monitored in two soil depths (0-0.3 m and 0.3-0.6 m) by using the time domain reflectometry method. The evaluation of soil water storage was carried out from plots with four of the crop systems (single maize or B. ruziziensis, and intercropping with the extreme sowing densities), at four different times. The increase in the sowing density of B. ruziziensis decreased the grain yield of the intercropped maize by 30.8 %. The intercropping system using 2 kg ha(-)1 of the grass seeds resulted in the best land-use efficiency (23 %). In addition, the intercropping treatments promoted a higher extraction of water from the soil, mainly at the maize growth stages with higher hydric demand (e.g., flowering and grain filling). These systems stimulate the extraction of water from deeper soil layers, when compared to maize in single cropping.

In agro-ecosystems, biodiversity is usually the calculation of comparative numbers and species of organisms. Insects are the largest and most diverse group of organisms in the world. During present study, different wheat fields of district Sialkot were sampled for the assessment of diversity and relative abundance of insect fauna. Collection of insects was carried out by the sweep net technique. A total of 896 specimens of insect fauna belonging to 15 species and 9 families were collected. Overall, maximum species diversity was observed during the month of April followed by the month of March. Highest relative abundance of sampled fauna was recorded in March (37.05%) followed by April (34.37%) while it was least in June (5.80%). This variation is probably due to temporal fluctuations observed in different months during which sampling was carried out. Overall, Schizaphis graminum (Rondani) or aphids was the most dominant species (17.52%) followed by Coccinella septempunctata (L.) (11.83%). The highly captured predator was C. septempunctata and prey was S. graminum. Simple linear regression showed the highest association between C. septempunctata (larva) and Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov) (R-2 = 0.945). The Shannon diversity index represented the significant results regarding Diversity (H'= 2.64), Evenness (E = 0.82) and Dominance (D = 0.08) of insect fauna sampled in 2017. The Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed the significant effect of rainfall and temperature on most of the sampled species. The current study would be helpful in future for the application of species-specific biological control in wheat field that will lead towards sustainability of agro-ecosystem. (C) 2019 The Authors.

J	"Gaiser, T; de Barros, I; Sereke, F; Lange, FM"				"Gaiser, Thomas; de Barros, Inacio; Sereke, Firesenai; Lange, Frank-Michael"			Validation and reliability of the EPIC model to simulate maize production in small-holder farming systems in tropical sub-humid West Africa and semi-arid Brazil	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"Crop growth model; Validation; Maize yield; Tropical regions; Soil effects; Local varieties"	"MAIZE/COWPEA INTERCROP; YIELD; SOIL; FERTILIZER; GROWTH; IMPACT"	The majority of existing crop growth models has been developed for temperate or subtropical regions and for high input cropping systems. However, climate, soil and management systems are quite different in tropical regions. Therefore, crop growth models in tropical regions require extended testing under a range of climatic, soil and management conditions. Multi-location calibration and validation of the EPIC (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate) model for maize production has been carried out using data sets from 22 sites in the semi-arid and sub-humid tropics in West Africa and North-East Brazil. The data sets originated from field experiments on research stations as well as on-farm trials with various treatments over one to four cropping seasons. The calibration procedure revealed the necessity to distinguish between local and improved varieties and to take into account specific parameterization requirements of hydromorphic soils influenced by groundwater or water-logging. Validation with grain yield data from 141 cropping seasons proved to be satisfactory with a mean error (ME) of 0.01 t ha(-1) and a mean relative error (MIRE) of 4%. However, the coefficient of determination for the regression between simulated and observed maize yields was quite low with a R-2-value of 0.69. Detailed analysis of the validation data set showed that model performance depends partially on soil acidity, with the poorest R-2-value of 0.40 on highly acidic soils with aluminum saturation of more than 35% (Alumi-Haplic Acrisols, Ferralsols and Ferralic Cambisols). When data of the other sites were pooled the R-2-value of the regression between simulated and observed maize yields was 0.79, which means that the model explained about 80% of the variance in crop yield. It is concluded that upscaling of the model to the regional scale requires the quantification of the usage of improved varieties and information about the extent of highly acid soils in the target region.

A field study, combined with the life cycle assessment (LCA), was conducted to select the effective and sustainable cropping systems in northwestern China. The study compared four maize-based intercropping and corresponding monoculture systems on crop yield, evapotranspiration (ET), water use efficiency (WUE), profitability, and carbon footprint (CF). Maize/wheat intercropping had the highest energy yield (532.5 GJ/ha, on average) and maize equivalent energy yield (MEEY) (522.3 G/ha, on average), followed by those from the maize/rape intercropping system, and the lowest by the sole potato system. The WUE of maize equivalent energy yield (WUEMEEY) was the highest (1.06 GJ ha(-1) mm(-1)) for sole rape system, followed by those for the maize/wheat and maize/rape intercropping systems. Maize/potato intercropping had the highest benefit: cost ratio at 3.30, followed by those for the maize/wheat intercropping (2.58), sole potato (2.57), and maize/rape intercropping (2.53). Lower CF and higher net ecosystem economic budget (NEEB) were observed in maize-based intercropping systems. The maize/wheat intercropping system had the lowest CF per maize equivalent energy yield (CFm) (10.7 kg CO2-eq GJ(-1) year(-1)), and the maize/potato intercropping system had the lowest CF per unit economic output (CFe) (0.14 kg CO2-eq US$(-1) year(-1)), and the highest NEEB (7,352.8 US$/ha). The data presented indicate that maize-based intercropping system may be a viable practice for the synthesized goals of higher productivity and profitability while lesser environmental footprint in a water-scarce region of northwest China.

Dry Matter Yield and Growth of Mixed Forage in Corn-Soybean Intercropping Systems Affected by Different Fertiliser Types	MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article						"Poultry manure; biofertiliser; chemical fertiliser; dry matter yield; mixed forage"	"NITROGEN; COTTON"	Fertilisation plays a major role in growth and dry matter yield of forage. A field experiment was conducted over two planting seasons on the same site to determine the effect of different fertilisers on growth of corn and soybean and dry matter yield of mixed forage. Six fertiliser treatments with three replications were arranged in randomised complete block design. The treatments were 100% chemical fertiliser (NPK), 100% poultry manure (PM), 50% PM, combined application of 50% PM with biofertiliser, sole biofertilser and untreated (control). The results in the first season showed that 100% NPK produced the highest dry matter yield (13.83 t ha(-1)) but in the second season, 100% PM produced a similar dry matter yield (9.91 t ha(-1)) with 100% NPK (9.84 t ha(-1)). Sole biofertiliser produced the same yield as 50% PM. The results indicate that 100% PM at the rate of 6.3 t ha(-1) significantly increased dry matter yield of mixed forage.

A Field Trial in Bangladesh	LAND			English	Article						"land-use optimization; legume plant; competition; above-ground resources; sustainable agriculture; food security"	"YIELD; AGRICULTURE; PRODUCTIVITY; FACILITATION; SECURITY; SYSTEMS; GROWTH; FORAGE; FOOD; SOIL"	Cultivating multiple crops together can provide numerous benefits, including improved soil health and crop yield. The objective of our study was to determine the optimum planting techniques in intercropping systems, and to maximize their benefits by mitigating competition for resources such as land, space, light interception, and nutrition. The performance of successively planted maize (Zea mays L.) grown with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) was evaluated with a field trial in Bangladesh. The treatments in our study were: (a) sole maize, (b) sole cowpea, (c) crops sown simultaneously, and (d) crops sown with different time lags (1, 2, and 3 weeks) between the maize-sowing and cowpea-sowing dates. Data on the crops' physiological parameters were recorded. These included light interception, leaf area index (LAI), Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD), harvest index, and yield. Simultaneously, canopy coverage was measured using camera-based photo analysis. In addition, an economic analysis of intercropping maize with soybean or cowpea was conducted using gross margin analysis and benefit-cost ratio. In our results, the below-canopy photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was significantly higher in intercropping treatments when maize was sown three weeks after cowpea. In contrast, the LAI value of the maize and cowpea was significantly greater when sown on the same day than in other intercropping treatments. As a result, the maize yield reduced when intercropped with cowpea. This reduction maximized when both species were sown simultaneously due to higher competition for resources, including nutrients and light. Intercropping was more beneficial in terms of land equivalent ratio than both sole cropping of maize and cowpea, especially when maize was planted three weeks later. However, this benefit was not retained when calculated as maize equivalent yield since the contribution of cowpea was small in the overall maize yield, suggesting the importance of the relative economic value of the component species. Among all treatments, the lowest maize equivalent yield (6.03 +/- 0.14 t ha(-1)) was obtained from sole cowpea, and the largest land equivalent ratio (1.67 +/- 0.05) was obtained from intercropping with maize sown three weeks after cowpea. This treatment provided a net income of USD 786.32 +/- 25.08 ha(-1). This study has shown that together, maize-cowpea intercropping with a temporal niche difference of three weeks may be a better option for sustainable crop production in Bangladesh, maximizing land use. However, it may not provide a significantly greater maize equivalent yield and economic return.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of intercropping systems of maize with brachiaria or crotalaria on qualitative and quantitative parameters of the weed seedbank, along the succession of pearl millet, maize and common bean. Moreover, the effect of these crop rotation systems on the selection of specific weed species of the seedbank was also evaluated. The experimental design was randomized blocks, with four replications. The treatments were represented by three cropping systems in succession: pearl millet, single maize, common bean; pearl millet, maize intercropped with brachiaria, common bean; pearl millet, maize intercropped with crotalaria, common bean. The following phytosociological indexes were calculated: density, frequency and relative importance, diversity and equitability. The grain yield of maize and common bean were also quantified. Twenty-three weed species were identified, divided into 12 families, highlighting the Poaceae one, with the most important being Alternanthera tenella, Commelina benghalensis, Eleusine indica and Phyllanthus tenellus. The cropping system with single maize presented a lower density and diversity of weeds, but with a high selection of E. indica. The intercropping systems in the previous crop, as a guarantee of a higher weed diversity, could be use as alternative tools, different from the herbicides, to control weeds and improve the common bean yield. Regarding the weed control in the common bean, Crotalaria spectabilis presented better results in the previous maize-intercropping system than Urochloa ruziziensis."

The genetic diversity of R. etli strains from bulk soil, bean nodules, the maize rhizosphere, the maize root, and inside stem tissue in traditional fields where maize is intercropped with P. vulgaris-beans was analyzed. Based on plasmid profiles and alloenzymes, it was determined that several R. etli types were preferentially encountered as putative maize endophytes. Some of these strains from maize were more competitive maize-root colonizers than other R. etli strains from the rhizosphere or from bean nodules. The dominant and highly competitive strain Ch24-10 was the most tolerant to 6-methoxy-2-benzoxazolinone (MBOA), a maize antimicrobial compound that is inhibitory to some bacteria and fungi. The R. tropici strain CIAT899, successfully used as inoculant of P. vulgaris, was also found to be a competitive maize endophyte in inoculation experiments.

J	"Siame, J; Willey, RW; Morse, S"				"Siame, J; Willey, RW; Morse, S"			A study of the partitioning of applied nitrogen between maize and beans in intercropping	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article							FIXATION	The experiment examined how nitrogen applied to a maize crop was partitioned when the maize was intercropped with beans. Treatments consisted of 2, 4 and 6 rows of beans at within-row spacings of 20 or 10 cm sown between 'maize' rows in which maize was either present or absent. Nitrogen was applied at 0, 30, 60, 90 or 120 kg ha(-1). Maize showed a large response to nitrogen and this was little affected by beans. All bean rows in all positions showed some response to nitrogen. The largest response was from the rows closest to the maize, but this response was similar whether these rows were 20, 40 or 60 cm from the maize. Beans gave a much greater response in the absence of maize, indicating that the main factor determining the partitioning of the nitrogen between the two crops was the superior competitive ability of the maize. It is suggested that the approach could be suitable for examining nitrogen partitioning in other non-legume/legume situations.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the potential of intercropping of summer legumes with maize to improve soil physical properties. The study was conducted in the field from September 2008 to September 2009, in an Ultisol in Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul. The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design with five treatments and four replications. The treatments consisted of the consortia: maize + cowpea, maize + dwarf pigeonpea, maize + velvet bean, monoculture maize, and a fallow area as control. Samples were collected from the soil layers 0-5 and 5-10 cm three times per plot (at the beginning of the experiment, 30 days after leaving the residues of each crop on the soil surface, and one year after the beginning of the experiment). We measured the following properties: soil bulk density, porosity, macro- and microporosity, and aggregate stability. All crops decreased bulk density and increased macroporosity and total porosity in the 0-5 cm soil, compared to the fallow area. The consortium of maize and pigeonpea increased the mean weighted diameter of aggregates in the 0-5 cm layer, compared to the fallow treatment, but this effect was temporary, and had disappeared by the last measurement. The intercropping of maize and dwarf pigeonpea was the most promising for improvements in the soil structure.

Assessment of maize and dry bean productivity under different intercrop systems and fertilization regimes	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						"Fertilizer application; food security; intercrop; land equivalent ratio (LER); planting density and seed inoculation"	YIELD	The productivity of different maize-dry bean intercrop systems (single and double rows of dry bean planted between two maize rows at low and high bean population) was assessed in 2006/07-08 seasons at different fertilizer application regimes (unfertilized control, low, adjusted low and optimum). Sole maize and dry bean plots were included as checks and together with the intercrop systems, they constituted the main treatment while the fertilizer regimes constituted the sub treatment. Treatments were arranged as a split plot design with three replications. There was a significant season x fertilizer interaction effect on maize grain and total biomass yields, and a significant season x cropping system interaction on dry bean grain yield. Grain yield for both crops were significantly (P<0.001) higher in 2007/08 with the highest maize grain yield of 2644 kg ha(-1) obtained at optimum fertilizer rate. Dry bean grain yield of 875 and 829 kg ha(-1) obtained in 2007/08 at optimum and adjusted low fertilizer rates, respectively were comparable. The highest mean grain yield of 2101 kg ha(-1) for maize and 728 kg ha(-1) for dry bean across the two seasons were obtained in single-bean row intercrop planted at low and high population, respectively. The single dry bean row intercrop system gave the highest productivity based on the total LER values and thus appears the most appropriate for small-scale farmers.	"[Kutu, F.

The difference in crop yield and interspecific relationship under different bandwidth and row ratio allocation patterns are still unclear. A field experiment was carried out to explore change regularities between crop yield and interspecific relationships under maize soybean intercropping with different bandwidths and row ratios. The results showed that the yield of intercropped crops was lower than that of the sole crop. The nitrogen accumulation (NA), NUE and nitrogen competition ratio was the highest under the intercropping mode with a bandwidth of 2.0 m, which indicated that this mode was more conducive to the N uptake and utilisation in crops. In all intercropping systems, nitrogen equivalent ratio (NER) and land equivalent ratio (LER) were all greater than one, indicating that intercropping systems were conducive to improving land utilisation efficiency and NUE. Under the same bandwidth pattern, expanding the maize soybean row ratio from 2 : 4 to 3 : 4 was beneficial to the improvement of LER, NER, NUE, crop group yield. In conclusion, it was preferable in the NA, NUE, crop group yield under the system of bandwidth 2.0 m and row ratio 2 : 2, which could be a reference for maize soybean intercropping system.

Under appropriate conditions, it usually results in higher overall productivity as compared with pure stands. Appraisal of agronomic practices is of particular importance, since component crops sometimes differ considerably in their structure and fertilization needs. An experiment was conducted under the subtropical conditions of Southern Nepal, in the Terai belt, in 1988 and 1989. Maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) received 0, 35 or 70 kg N ha-1 when grown either in pure stands or when intercropped in two spatial arrangements differing in spatial intimacy. Nitrogen fertilization resulted in similar grain yield increases for maize either in pure stands or in intercropping with soybean, indicating that the availability of nitrogen for the cereal was comparable in both cropping systems. Soybean yields were 22% lower in the presence of maize, as compared with a pure stand. The overall productivity of intercropping, as assessed by ATER (area-time equivalent ratio), was significantly higher than that of pure stands in 1988 and 1989. Land-use efficiency was higher when maize was intercropped with nodulating soybean, as compared to non-nodulating soybean, but only at 0 and 35 kg N ha-1.

As roots are the primary organ for perceiving signals in the soil from neighboring plants, root behavior may play an important role in soil-borne disease control. Principal Findings: In two years of field experiments, maize/soybean intercropping suppressed the occurrence of soybean red crown rot, a severe soil-borne disease caused by Cylindrocladium parasiticum (C. parasiticum). The suppressive effects decreased with increasing distance between intercropped plants under both low P and high P supply, suggesting that root interactions play a significant role independent of nutrient status. Further detailed quantitative studies revealed that the diversity and intensity of root interactions altered the expression of important soybean PR genes, as well as, the activity of corresponding enzymes in both P treatments. Furthermore, 5 phenolic acids were detected in root exudates of maize/soybean intercropped plants. Among these phenolic acids, cinnamic acid was released in significantly greater concentrations when intercropped maize with soybean compared to either crop grown in monoculture, and this spike in cinnamic acid was found dramatically constrain C. parasiticum growth in vitro. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first report to demonstrate that intercropping with maize can promote resistance in soybean to red crown rot in a root-dependent manner. This supports the point that intercropping may be an efficient ecological strategy to control soil-borne plant disease and should be incorporated in sustainable agricultural management practices.

The aim of this study was to evaluate resource capture and resource use efficiency in maize-soybean and sunflower-soybean intercrops and in their respective sole crops. Water and radiation capture, biomass and grain production were measured for sole crops and intercrops. Water and radiation productivities were estimated as the energy produced per unit of annual available resource. Comparisons of intercrops with soybean sole crops were emphasized because current soybean expansion in the region represents a threat to agricultural system sustainability. Intercrops showed an increase in crop duration when compared to their sole counterparts. Maize-soybean intercrop resulted in an improved radiation and water productivities compared with soybean sole crops. Maize cultivated as sole crop attained the highest resource productivity. On the other hand, resource productivity of sunflower-soybean intercrop was higher than or similar to its corresponding sole crops. The improvement in water productivity for intercrop compared with soybean sole crop was accounted for by an increase in water capture efficiency and, also, by an increase in water use efficiency in the case of maize-soybean intercrop. The increase in radiation productivity for maize-soybean intercrop compared with soybean sole crop was the result of an increase in radiation use efficiency and of a minor but significant increase in radiation capture efficiency. Contrarily, the improvement in radiation productivity of sunflower-soybean intercrop compared with sunflower or soybean sole crops was null or small. Grain yield of intercropped sunflower and maize was 20% lower than yield of sole crops. Therefore, yield attained by intercropping was mainly limited by a poor production of the soybean component. This work provides eco-physiological basis to improve management practices of summer intercrops. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	"[Coll, L.; Cerrudo, A.; Rizzalli, R.; Monzon, J.

The main objective of the study was to investigate the effect of different plant populations of maize and beans, at two nitrogen levels, on the performance of the component crops. Two maize (20,000 and 40,000 plants ha(-1)) and three bean (30,000; 60,000 and 90,000 plants ha(-1)) populations were tested in a randomized complete block design with tree replicates. Grain yields of maize and beans were affected by intercropping and the effect was more detrimental to the legume mainly at the highest maize plant population. The application of nitrogen fertilizer to maize rows mitigated intercropping effect on maize at higher population (40,000 plants ha(-1)) and, at lower maize plant population (20,000 plants ha(-1)), benefited the associated beans by increasing grain yields. Land Equivalent Ratio values for grain yields of maize and beans showed that intercropping compared to sole cropping is advantageous and best indices were obtained at a bean plant population of 60,000 plants ha(-1)."

The experiments were carried out in 2008 and 2009 in a randomized block design, with 25 treatments and four replicates. Treatments consisted of five irrigation depths at 70, 110, 140, 180 and 220% of the crop evapotranspiration, and of five doses of P2O5: 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200% of the recommended P dose. Maize was sown at 0.80x0.40 m spacing, and cowpea was planted inside the lines among maize plants. There was no effect of P2O5 doses, but the response to irrigation depths was quadratic for maize and linear for cowpea. The maximum technical yield of green ears of maize with straw (10.76 Mg ha(-1)) and without straw (7.62 Mg ha(-1)) was obtained with 530 mm depth, intermediary to the 180 and 220% of the crop evapotranspiration. The highest cowpea green grain (3.40 Mg ha(-1)) was obtained with the highest water depth, of 644 mm.

However, studies of the effect of intercropping on controlling water loss on sloping land are few. In this study, with maize (Zea mays L.) and potato (Solanum tuberosum L) as experimental crops, a comparison was made of surface runoff, soil evaporation, soil moisture content, crop transpiration and crop yield between the intercropping and the sole crop on sloping land during 2012-2013. Data showed that: (1) the accumulative runoff in maize and potato intercropping (IC) was not significantly different from that in sole potato (SP), but significantly decreased by 56.75-74.53% (P<0.05)as compared with that in the sole maize (SM); (2) the daily mean soil evaporation in IC decreased by 20.83-28.44% (P < 0.05) as compared with that in SM, and decreased by 6.99-14.85% (P = 0.034 in 2012 and P=0.064 in 2013) as compared with that in SP; (3) the soil moisture content in IC at each observation, period was higher than that in SM and SP (P=0.101 in late July and P<0.05 in other periods); (4) the transpiration in IC was significantly higher than that in SM and SP (P<0.05); and (5) the land equivalent ratio (LER) of IC was 1.19-1.34 (P< 0.05), indicating that the maize and potato intercropping induced a yield advantage. Overall, the results suggested that on sloping land, the maize and potato intercropping can reduce the water loss from the surface runoff and the soil evaporation, thus increasing the soil moisture content and contribute to the increase of the transpiration and crop yield. Data also indicated that the lower runoff in maize and potato intercropping compared with sole maize is associated not only with the higher leaf area index, but also with the potato tubers.

Arboreal leguminous plants can control weeds, and fertilization with nitrogen can increases the competitive ability of the maize. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of weed-removal and intercropping with sabia (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia) on control of weed plants and maize productivity. A randomized complete block design in a split-plot arrangement was used with five replications. Cultivar AG 105, fertilized with nitrogen (30 and 120 kg/ha of N applied to the plots) was subjected to the following treatments (subplots): A) no weeding; B) intercropping with sabia (30 viable seeds/m(2), broadcast between the rows of maize); C) hoeing [20 and 40 days after sowing (DAS)] with no removal of weeds (nROW); D) two hoeings at 20 and 40 DAS with ROW at 20 DAS; E) two hoeings at 20 and 40 DAS with ROW at 40 DAS; F) and two hoeings at 20 and 40 DAS with ROW after each hoeing. Increasing the dose of nitrogen reduced the growth of the sabia (30%) and weeds (32%) and increased the corn green ear yield (115%) and grain yield (40%) of maize. Sabia did not reduce the growth of weeds, but it was beneficial to corn because increased the number of green ears. Carrying out two hoeings, with or without the removal of weeds, reduced weed growth (92%) and provided the highest yields of green ears (5.6 t/ha) and grains (6.0 t/ha)."

Cumulative effects and economic benefits of intercropping maize with food legumes on Striga hermonthica infestation	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Striga control; Intercropping; Legumes; Desmodium; Economic benefits"	"PUSH-PULL TECHNOLOGY; ON-FARM EVALUATION; DESMODIUM-UNCINATUM; SOIL FERTILITY; GUINEA SAVANNA; ROOT EXUDATE; SORGHUM; MANAGEMENT; STEMBORERS; WITCHWEED"	The parasitic weed Striga hermonthica, commonly known as striga, is a major biotic constraint to maize production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where it causes serious food insecurity and poverty in smallholder farming communities. We previously discovered an effective control method for it involving intercropping cereals with fodder legumes in the genus Desmodium, commonly known as desmodium. The objectives of the current study were to evaluate cumulative effects of intercropping maize with the commonly grown food legumes on striga infestation, and to establish any economic benefits of the same. Treatments comprised maize plots planted in monocrop stands or intercropped with five different food legume species or desmodium. lntercropping maize with desmodium gave the most consistent and significant suppression of striga. Out of the food legume intercrops, only crotalaria, groundnut and greengram intercrops had significantly lower striga counts and only in some of the cropping seasons. Grain yields were consistently and significantly higher with desmodium intercrop, although they were also increased with food legume intercrops compared to maize monocrop, thus confirming superiority of intercropping with legumes over maize monocrop. Although production costs in terms of total labor and variable costs were significantly higher for the intercrops than for the maize monocrop, total revenue and net benefits were significantly higher in the former, especially for desmodium. The desmodium intercrop gave the highest economic benefits followed by crotalaria and greengram intercrops. These results confirmed the effectiveness of desmodium in suppressing striga and improving yields and economic returns to smallholder farmers. They also showed that it is profitable to invest in food legume intercrop systems, especially the crotalaria and greengram systems, and indicate that intensifying maize cropping systems through integration of these food legumes in combination with other approaches can contribute to an integrated management of striga and provide a more sustainable and profitable productive system to smallholder farmers.

EFFECT OF REDUCED TILLAGE AND MINERAL FERTILIZER APPLICATION ON MAIZE AND SOYBEAN PRODUCTIVITY	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article							"PHOSPHORUS APPLICATION; CONSERVATION TILLAGE; RESIDUE MANAGEMENT; SOIL PROPERTIES; ORGANIC-MATTER; CROP-ROTATION; BULK-DENSITY; WHEAT; YIELD; SYSTEMS"	Reduced tillage is said to be one of the potential ways to reverse land degradation and ultimately increase the productivity of degrading soils of Africa. We hypothesised that crop yield following amodest application of 2 t ha(-1) of crop residue in a reduced tillage system is similar to the yield obtained from a conventional tillage system, and that incorporation of legumes in a cropping system leads to greater economic benefits as opposed to a cropping system involving continuous maize. Three cropping systems (continuous maize monocropping, legume/maize intercropping and rotation) under different tillage and residue management systems were tested in sub-humid western Kenya over 10 seasons. While soybean performed equally well in both tillage systems throughout, maize yield was lower in reduced than conventional tillage during the first five seasons but no significant differences were observed after season 6. Likewise, with crop residue application, yields in conventional and reduced tillage systems are comparable after season 6. Nitrogen and phosphorus increased yield by up to 100% compared with control. Gross margins were not significantly different among the cropping systems being only 6 to 39% more in the legume-cereal systems relative to similar treatments in continuous cereal monocropping system. After 10 seasons of reduced tillage production, the economic benefits for our cropping systems are still not attractive for a switch from the conventional to reduced tillage.

A three years field experiment consisting of six cropping treatments applied during both seasons was conducted during 2008-09 to 2010-11 to study the effect of nitrogen and legumes intercropping with maize (Zea mays L.) for sustainability of maize-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping system. Results indicate that the photosynthetic active radiation had highest values at noon reaching nearly 1940 mu mol/m(2)/s for maize and 1620 mu mol/m(2)/s for intercropped legumes.Intercropping can increase light interception, shading and reduce water evaporation as compared to sole maize.Maize intercropped had higher values of stomatal condutance and leaf temperature than sole crop.The grain yield and yield attributing characters of wheat crop increased significantly under intercropping treatments over respective check. Wheat yield significantly increased up to 160 kg N/ha. However, there was no significant increase in yield of maize beyond 120 kg N/ha.Sole maize-wheat rotation showed a decline in soil organic carbon by 3.7%,while blackgram and cowpea intercropping with maize in paired rows (2:2 row ratio) followed by wheat increased contents of per cent organic carbon in soil as 0.63 and 0.67 respectively,compared to initial values of 0.54 per cent.Plots treated with intercrops/FYM during the rainy season sustained the wheat yield while the check plot showed a decline in wheat yield by 4-9%.

This study aimed to assess the effects of intercropping with Urochloa ruziziensis and Crotalaria spectabilis on the maize agronomic performance and the straw production and quality after the harvest. Three treatments (single maize and maize intercropped with U. ruziziensis and with C. spectabilis) were distributed into a randomized blocks design. The growth and production components and the maize grain yield were evaluated in the three systems, as well as the straw production and nitrogen accumulation in each system. The intercropping systems did not decrease the maize yield and agronomic performance, if compared to the single crop, regardless of the evaluated species.

Two experiments were conducted in the field, in late harvest and in harvest periods. The experimental design was a randomized block, with 14 treatments and four replicates. Eight treatments with herbicides bentazon (720 and 960 g a.i. ha(-1)), nicosulfuron (16 and 48 g a.i. ha(-1)) and bentazon plus nicosulfuron (720 + 16; 720 + 48; 960 + 16; 960 + 48 g a.i. ha-1) were studied, besides six controls (single crop maize and sunn hemp, with and without weed control, intercropped maize and sunn hemp, with and without weed control). Herbicide bentazon alone, in both dosages evaluated, was selective to C. juncea. Nicosulfuron in the dosage of 48 g a.i. ha(-1), alone or in a mixture with bentazon, promoted the best weed control. Maize interferes in the recoverability of sunn hemp plants treated with herbicides. C. juncea intercropped without herbicides or sprayed with bentazon negatively impacted maize yield in the harvest. The pulverization of bentazon (720 and 960 g a.i. ha(-1)) in late harvest and bentazon plus nicosulfuron (720 + 16 and 920 + 16 g a.i. ha(-1)) in harvest provided the best results, considering maize yield, development and recovery of sunn hemp and weed management."

In this study, we compared continuous cropping with lily/maize intercropping. We also examined the lily rhizosphere microbes community in both sole lily cropping and lily/maize intercropping systems, by the llumina Miseq platform. Here we refer to data of recent years field experimentation of a lily/maize intercrop system in different planting configurations in the Gaolan Ecological and Agricultural Research Station. Treatments included sole crops of lily and maize, an intercrop consisting of strips of four lily rows alternating with one maize rows. The land equivalent ratio (LER) of intercrops was 1.294. The results showed that compared to sole cropping, the yield of lily in the first year of planting increased when lily was intercropped with maize. The species annotation of the high-throughput sequencing experiment showed that there was no difference in the diversity of the lily rhizosphere soil microbes on phylum taxonomic level, but the relative abundance of some genus changed obviously. The relative abundance of harmful fungus Fusarium spp. and, Funneliformis spp., decreased, and the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria Sphingomonas spp. and, Nitrospira spp., increased. In addition, we found that Lecanicillium spp., appeared only in the intercropping lily rhizosphere soil and sole cropping maize rhizosphere soil. In conclusion, the findings indicated that lily/maize intercropping could change soil microenvironment, and affect the diversity and structure of microorganism community in lily rhizosphere, with further beneficial effect on the yield of lily.

A group of field experiments at three locations (Yaan, Lezhi and Renshou) in two consecutive years of 2012-2013 were conducted to study crop production and nutrients recovery of maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) in monocropping and additive relay intercropping systems. The results showed that the total crop yields of the 2:2 maize-to-soybean wide-narrow row spacing planting pattern (RIwn) were significantly higher than that of the 1:1 maize-to-soybean equal row spacing planting pattern (RIe), and the average land equivalent ratios (LER) of the grain yield were 1.79 and 1.49 for the RIwn and RIe, respectively. The nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) recovery efficiency calculated by the ratios of crop nutrients removed and fertilizer input indicated that the RIwn had a higher nutrients recovery than the RIe due to proper spacing between maize and soybean rows and higher soybean yield in RIwn. In terms of the amount of fertilizer applied, based on this experiment, P should be reduced in maize plantings and increased in soybean plantings to maintain the balance of soil P. Considering the higher temperatures during the soybean vegetative growth phase, N fertilizer inputs should be controlled to prevent excessive soybean growth. In addition, excess K was taken up in the crop biomass, maybe the straw should be returned to the field to maintain soil K fertility sustainable for the long term.

An experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of cropping system, location and nitrogen fertilization on maize growth parameters. The study comprised three cropping systems (cowpea-maize rotation, monocropping maize and intercropped maize), three locations (Potchefstroom, Taung and Rustenburg) and two rates of nitrogen fertilizers applied at each location (0 and 95 kg ha(-1) at Potchefstroom, 0 and 92 at Rustenburg, 0 and 113.5 at Taung). The study was a factorial experiment randomised in complete block design with three replications, conducted during 2011/12 and 2012/13 planting seasons. Measured parameters were days to 100% tasseling, maize plant height, number of leaves per plant, leaf area and stem diameter. Cropping system, location, nitrogen fertilizer and season had significant effects (p<0.05) on maize leaf area and plant height. Maize planted at Potchefstroom had significantly larger stem diameter than maize planted at Taung and Rustenburg. Rotational cropping system had significant role in terms of maize phenological growth. Location and nitrogen fertilization also had a significant influence on growth of maize plants.

There is no available information regarding the combination of intercropping system and water table control to conserve soil N in maize production systems. A 2-yr study was conducted to examine the effects of cropping systems (monocrop maize, and maize intercropped with annual Italian ryegrass [Lolium multiflorum Lam.]) and water table controls (free drainage, or subirrigation to establish water table depths at 70 and 80 cm below the soil surface) on conserving soil N, under climatic and soil conditions of southwestern Quebec. The resulting six treatments were fertilized in the spring with 270 kg N ha(-1). The effects of adding fertilizer at 0, 180, and 270 kg N ha(-1) on monocrop maize with free drainage were also investigated. Soil cores of 1 m in depth were collected in the spring and fall of 1993 and 1994. In 1993, intercropping decreased the amount of NO3--N in the top 1 m of soil profile by 47% (92.3 kg N ha(-1)) relative to monocropped maize at harvest time. Water table depth had less effect on soil NO3--N content than cropping system. Both increasing water table depth and monocrop maize enhanced downward movement of NO3--N during the growing season and following spring. More NO3--N was present in freely drained subsoil under maize given 270 kg N ha(-1) than under maize given 180 kg N ha(-1).

However, the synergistic agricultural production mode of economy and ecology is still rare in this region. In this study, a 4-year fixed-point experiment was conducted to study the soil characteristics, production and ecological effects of three typical planting modes (continuous maize [CM], continuous peanuts [CP] and a rotational strip intercropping of maize and peanuts [RMP]). The results indicated that RMP had multiple benefits compared with CM and CP: it improved the soil carbon stocks in the 10-20 cm soil layer by 20.11 % and 34.19 %, respectively; it increased the grain yield and economic benefits, with an increase of 19.68 % and 17.29 % in the average annual yield of maize and peanuts, respectively, and an increase in revenue of 23.14 % and 13.99 %, respectively; the land use efficiency can be improved and the average land equivalent ratio of 4 years is 1.20; the soil erosion and the resulting carbon emissions were reduced, with a decrease in the intensity of erosion of 8.28 % and 45.45 %, respectively, and a decrease of 22.73 % and 45.16 % in the resulting carbon emissions, respectively. Correlation analysis showed that the improvement in soil characteristics, such as the modification of soil organic carbon, mineralized carbon, and an increase in available nutrients, helps to increase the yields of maize and peanut in the RMP. In conclusion, RMP resulted in multiple benefits and was more consistent with sustainable agricultural production in the agropastoral ecotone region."

Effects of disease and environment on competitive interactions among wheat genotypes were investigated. Five wheat genotypes were grown in up to six different two-way combinations and as pure stands in two or three locations during one to three growing seasons in the presence and absence of wheat stripe rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis). 2. Overall yield of the mixtures relative to the means of the monocultures did not differ among locations and years. However, interactions between genotypes were often affected by location and to a lesser degree by year. Disease significantly affected seed weight and seed number of the two susceptible genotypes in pure stands and in mixtures. Disease also led to changes in competitive interactions between resistant and susceptible genotypes. 3. Competitive interactions among genotypes often changed from early in the season (as measured by the number of tillers) to late in the season (as measured by yield per tiller). In a few mixtures negative correlations between early competitive ability (relative number of tillers) and components of late competition suggested that intra-genotypic competition might have been stronger than inter-genotypic competition.

Fortnightly dynamics and relationship of growth, dry matter partition and productivity of maize based sole and intercropping systems at different elevations	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"Biological yield; Correlation; Days after germination; Economic yield; Growth rate; Intercropping"		Understanding temporal dynamics of growth and dry matter production of sole and intercropped maize under different agro-climatic and cultural conditions is imperative to devise crop models and optimize resources for better crop production. Field experiments comprising seven cropping systems (maize-mungbean, maize-cowpea, maize-soybean, maize sole, mungbean sole, cowpea sole, soybean sole) were performed for three years (2015, 2016 and 2017) at three elevation sites (1500, 1800 and 2200 m from mean above sea level) using factorial randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. Maize growth (plant height, number of leaves, leaf area), dry matter partitioning (leaf, stem, plant) and absolute growth rate (AGR) were observed for five growth intervals (1-15, 16-30, 31-45, 46-60 and 61-75 days after germination, DAG) while yield components (thousand grain weight, grain yield, biological yield) were recorded at harvesting. Furthermore, productivity, land equivalent ratio (LER) and competition index (CR) of cropping systems computed from biomass and grain yields of maize and legumes were also compared in terms of economic and biological yields. The growth parameters, dry matter production and AGR of maize varied significantly (p <= 0.05) due to individual and interaction effect of year, elevation, and legume during 31-45, 46-60 and 61-75 DAG but did not vary significantly during the 1-15 and 16-30 DAG. Growth parameters, dry matter production, AGR and harvest yields of maize were the highest during 2015, at 1500 m elevation, and in intercropping with mungbean but at par with maize sole cropping. System productivity and LER were greater for maize-mungbean cropping compared to rest of the cropping systems including sole cropping. Growth parameters and dry matter production of maize were found strongly correlated (r = 0.84-0.98) with its grain and biomass yields. It is concluded that 3rd, 4th and 5th fortnightly intervals are critical periods for intercropped maize where its growth and biomass production are significantly influenced due to competition with legumes. Lower elevations and mungbean as intercrop with maize are recommended for greater economic and biological productivity of maize based intercropping systems.

Improvements in intercrop yields may be achieved through an understanding of yield advantages due to above-ground or below-ground interactions. 2. Forage maize and two morphologically contrasting cultivars of pea (leafy cv. Bohatyr and semi-leafless cv. Grafila) were grown alone and in additive mixtures, under two contrasting levels of soil moisture (+/- water stress). 3. The mechanism of competition between maize and pea was studied by separating the effects of root competition and shoot competition, using soil and aerial partitions. Plants were grown in rectangular tanks in a glasshouse. 4. Leafy pea cv. Bohatyr was as competitive as maize, both below-ground and above-ground, whereas semi-leafless pea cv. Grafila was less competitive than maize or pea cv. Bohatyr. The greater competitive ability of the leafy pea, both above- and below-ground, was probably due to its greater growth rate, associated with its greater leaf area. 5. The competitive ability of maize, relative to peas, was considerably reduced by water stress. Both the root and shoot competitive abilities of pea were greater under water stress, compared with those of maize. 6. Relative yield total (RYT) values were significantly greater when maize and pea were subjected to shoot competition only (RYT = 1.76) than when subjected to root competition (RYT = 1.17) or when subjected to both shoot and root competition (RYT = 1.13). This reflects the fact that the effects of root competition were greater than those of shoot competition. 7. Root competition decreased the shoot dry weights, plant height and leaf area of both maize and pea, whereas shoot competition had no significant effect on these attributes, indicating that soil resources, i.e. mineral nutrients and water, were more limiting than light.

J	"Walker, S; Ogindo, HO"				"Walker, S; Ogindo, HO"			The water budget of rainfed maize and bean intercrop	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH			English	"Article; Proceedings Paper"	3rd WaterNet/Warfsa Symposium	OCT 30-31, 2002	DAR ES SALAAM, TANZANIA			"soil water budget; cropping systems; evapotranspiration; climate"	"RESOURCE USE; SOIL; EVAPORATION; MOISTURE; CROP"	Food production in the South African Development Community (SADC) region is predominantly under rainfed conditions and therefore experiences annual fluctuations due to the rainfall variability. Although the staple food of maize (Zea mays) is commonly grown in the same field as dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) little work has been done to characterize the soil water budget of this intercropping system. The evapotranspiration can theoretically be divided into transpiration from the leaves and evaporation from the soil surface. However, it is difficult to separate the components in field studies. In this paper the Ritchie model is used to estimate the soil surface evaporation using the fractional radiation interception which depends on the crop leaf area. The intercropping system has higher leaf area than the sole crops of both maize and beans in all seasons. Therefore, the soil surface is shaded and the canopy is more dense resulting in a lower soil surface evaporation. The water budget thus gives a higher value of transpiration for the intercrop during each of the four growing seasons. This appears to be due to the complimentary use of the water resources by the maize and bean plants in the intercropping system. This illustrates the ability of the intercrop to use the available soil water in a semi-arid environment more productively. Thus the experience of the small-holder farmers in the SADC region is based on sound physical principles of water use by the two crops. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Straw returning and plastic film mulch are effective and valuable measures to boost crop productivity in arid or semi-arid regions. It is unknown whether the yield advantage of strip intercropping can be further enhanced by improving photosynthetic characteristics when applied synchronously with straw returning and plastic film mulch measures. A field experiment on wheat-maize intercropping system was conducted at strip management with straw and plastic film, and photosynthetic characteristics, leaf and soil water potential, and grain yield were determined. The results showed that the SPAD value of wheat and maize leaves with NTSM/NTP (no-tillage with wheat straw mulch in wheat strips and previous residual plastic film mulch in maize strips) was decreased at the vegetative growth period, a higher SPAD value was maintained at the reproductive growth period, compared to CT/CTP (conventional tillage with no straw returning in wheat strips and annual new plastic film mulch in maize strips), it indicated that NTSM/NTP treatment can maintain high physiological activity of intercropped wheat and maize at their reproductive growth period. NTSM/NTP treatment raised net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and leaf water use efficiency (WUEL) of wheat by 9.0-15.8 % and 4.9-8.8 % from filling (Feekes 11.0) to doughing (Feekes 11.2) stage, and raised both indexes of maize by 11.5-25.5 % and 4.7-14.8 % from milking (R3) to doughing (R4) stage, with little effect on transpiration rate (Tr), in comparison to CT/CTP, respectively. NTSM/NTP treatment kept relatively high leaf and soil water potential of intercropped strips, and favorably created a suitable soil moisture environment for enhancing the drought resistance on intercrops. In addition, the value of difference between leaf and soil water potential of wheat and maize in NTSM/NTP treatment was lower than that in CT/CTP treatment at given determining stages, it indicated that NTSM/NTP treatment was beneficial to maintaining the stability of crop water demand and soil water supply for growth of two intercrops. Thus, NTSM/NTP treatment obtained high grain yields, increased by 8.6-11.1 % for intercropped wheat, increased by 16.0-20.2 % for intercropped maize, and increased by 13.8-17.1 % for intercropped wheat plus maize, in comparison to CT/CTP treatment. The improved photosynthetic capacity, optimized leaf and soil water potential, and increased grain yields for intercropped wheat and maize in NTSM/NTP treatment. Therefore, strip intercropping integrated of no tillage with wheat straw and previous residual plastic film mulch can be recommended as the excellent technique to coordinate the contradiction between water shortage and high grain yield in arid irrigated regions.

The experimental plots were laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Field experiment comprised five treatments including three intercropping combinations (3:1, 2:2 and 1:3) and sole culture of common bean and maize. Analysis of variance indicated that intercropping system significantly influenced bean and maize traits. The seed yields of common bean obtained from sole bean and maize:bean intercropping (1:3) was statistically similar and significantly higher than other intercropping treatments. The highest value of maize grain yield was obtained in sole cropping of maize. Total land equivalent ratio (LER) was grater to one (1.24) in two rows of common bean between two rows of maize (M50B50), indicating the increase of the yield in this intercropping treatment and advantage was equal to 24%. The highest competitive ratio (CR) for maize was obtained in M75B25. The maize sole crop and intercrops indicated a reduction in weeds, as compared with the bean sole crop. The intercrops of one row of common bean between three rows of maize (M75B25) seemed more suppressed weeds than both of maize and bean sole crops. This research indicates that maize-common bean intercropping was an appropriate method for utilizing the available resources and reducing weed infestations in organic farming systems. Bean had a proportionately low competitive effectiveness towards weeds and intercropping can be a way to produce successfully beans in organic farming.

Maize and Potato Intercropping: A Technology to Increase Productivity and Profitability in Tigray	OPEN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						"Hawzen; Intercropping arrangement; Land Equivalent Ratio (LER); sole cropping; grain yield; tuber yield"	RATIO	Smallholders have limited landholding in the highlands of Tigray and therefore there is a critical need to improve land use efficiency (LUE). One way to improve the LUE is through intercropping of companion crops including maize and potato. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the intercropping ratio as a means to improve land use efficiency during the 2012 cropping season. The treatments tested were three intercropping ratios of maize: potato in 1: 1, 1: 2, 2: 1 row arrangement compared against the maize and potato only cropping. The objective of the study was to identify the best intercropping ratio that maximizes land use efficiency. Land equivalent ratio (LER) was used to compare the land use efficiency of the intercrops with each sole crop. The total yield of intercropped crops were greater than sole cropping, shown by LER>1. The overall advantage of intercropping ranged from 35 to 58%. The highest land equivalent value of 58% was recorded for one maize and two potato rows arrangements indicated a yield advantage of 58% over sole crop. The partial land equivalent value of both crops in intercropping was less than one indicating the cohesiveness of both crops in intercropping. Thus, it can be concluded that 1maize: 2 potato intercropping is a viable agronomic option in increasing land use efficiency and increased food security. It is, therefore, imperative to demonstrate the best treatment under farmer's condition.

Millsp; Avena strigosa schreb; Integrated crop-livestock system; N-15 tracer technique"		The development of integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLSs) under no-tillage (NT) is of global interest for improving agroecosystem sustainability in tropical regions. In these crop systems, nitrogen (N) is the most essential nutrient. Nitrogen needs vary according to environmental conditions and crop rotation and are higher when crop succession is performed with grasses only. Intercropping maize with legumes is an interesting alternative to improve agricultural management and N cycling. To better understand N dynamics in ICLSs, in this study, two maize (Zea mays L.) silage production systems were developed: intercropping with palisadegrass (Urochloa brizantha `Marandu', syn. Brachiaria brizantha) only or palisadegrass and pigeon pea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] (summer-autumn). In both intercropping systems, black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb) was oversown and grazed by lambs (winter-spring). We assessed biomass production, N uptake, and fertilizer-N recovery due to the addition of N-15-labeled fertilizer in maize intercropped with palisadegrass and pigeon pea and the residual effect on black oat grazed by lambs during two growing seasons in a Typic Haplorthox in southeastern Brazil. The triple intercropped crops produced higher amounts of silage and pasture biomass and efficiently increased the use of N fertilizer by maize, thereby promoting greater N-15 recovery. Palisadegrass and pigeon pea are a good option for cultivation in tropical regions, as this combination did not alter the measured levels of N in the intercropping systems but improved N dynamics, efficiency, balance, and N fertilizer distribution in the soil-plant system. This study provides a better understanding of N dynamics in the soil-plant system to support more efficient N fertilization in ICLS under NT.	"[Costa, Nidia R.; Crusciol, Carlos A.

Maize yield was highest in intercropping system, the difference being significant in two years only. Additional yield of mungbean ranging from 2.5-3.5 q/ha was obtained in different planting patterns. Total productivity in different intercropping systems was 3.1 to 5.7 q/ha higher than the sole maize. One row of mungbean planted between two normal spaced maize rows in north-south direction was the best planting pattern. Leaf area index, periodic solar radiation interception and ancillary characters of both the component crops are also discussed.

However, there is much scope to improve existing cropping systems by devising and evaluating modifications that allow more effective use of the season. To this effect, experiments were conducted to quantify efficiency of sequential intercropping consisting of maize (Zea mays L.), common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and mung bean (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek) during 2007 and 2009 cropping seasons, in southern Ethiopia. Treatments included three- and two-crop associations and equivalent sole crops of components. Land equivalent ratio (LER) and area time equivalency ratio (ATER) were used to estimate intercropping advantage. Maize had the highest partial LER, 0.95, whenever mung bean comes first in the sequence. Comparable partial LERs were observed in common bean irrespective of planting times while mung bean had greater partial LERs from simultaneous rather than sequential planting. Maize had the highest competitive ratio (1.56) followed by common bean (0.67) and mung bean (0.53). The three-crop association involving simultaneous planting of maize with mung bean followed by common bean (MZ + MB - CB) gave the highest mean total LER of 1.66. This combination also had the highest combined productivity and maximum monetary gain, which is above the minimum acceptable marginal rate of return. It exceeded advantages from intercrops of maize-common bean by 41% and maize-mung bean by 23%. Thus, farmers would get greater advantage from practicing sequential intercropping in areas where the season is sufficient to grow long-duration maize.

Inoculation significantly increased LAI in mungbean, and dry matter yield in both mungbean and associated maize. Applied N increased the LAI and dry matter yield in maize, while decreased the same in mungbean. Low N slightly increased the harvest index in intercropped mungbean compared to sole mungbean. inoculation and N at 90 kg/ha increased the partitioning index in intercropped maize compared to sole maize. Partitioning index of mungbean decreased at high N levels. Inoculation of mungbean improved the grain yield of associated maize from 2.05 to 2.37 t/ha. Applied N increased intercropped maize yield consistently from 0.89 t/ha with control to 3.43 t/ha at 90 kg N/ha. Yield of mungbean increased slightly with inoculation, but at 60 and 90 kg N/ha it decreased significantly regardless of inoculation levels.

In this intercropping system, competitive interactions between maize and peanut for N and improvement of Fe uptake were likely to be important factors affecting N-2 fixation of peanut. The experiment was comprised of three treatments which included treatment I: peanut monocropping; treatment II: maize/peanut intercropping (the major and the minor compartments with low N, 50 mg kg(-1)); treatment III: maize/peanut intercropping (the major compartment with low N, 50 mg kg(-1) and the minor compartment with high, N 200 mg kg(-1)). The minor compartment of treatment III was fertilized with 200 mg kg(-1) N for reducing or eliminating the competition of N coming from intercropping maize. Intercropping with maize corrected Fe chlorosis of peanut by significantly increasing plant Fe concentration and uptake. Compared with the monocropping treatment, iron uptake increased from intercropping treatment II and III by 22 and 24% per plant, 30 and 29% shoots, 38 and 60% nodules. Iron uptake by the root nodules was especially enhanced in the intercropping system. In contrast, intercropping with maize had little effect on NO3--N concentrations in the soil rhizosphere of peanut or on N concentrations and uptake by peanut compared with plants in monoculture. The results indicate that the improvement in Fe nutrition was an important factor promoting N-2 fixation by peanut in the intercropping system at the flowering stage of peanut growth, and that competition for N by intercropped maize had little effect on N-2 fixation by peanut under the experimental conditions."

Cereal-legume intercropping is widely used to enhance crop yield and improve resource use efficiency, especially in Southwest China. To optimize N utilization and increase grain yield, we conducted a two-year field experiment with single-factor randomized block designs of a maize-soybean intercropping system (IMS). Three N rates, NN (no nitrogen application), LN (lower N application: 270 kg N ha(-1)), and CN (conventional N application: 330 kg N ha(-1)), and three topdressing distances of LN (LND), e.g., 15 cm (LND1), 30 cm (LND2) and 45 cm (LND3) from maize rows were evaluated. At the beginning seed stage (R5), the leghemoglobin content and nitrogenase activity of LND3 were 1.86 mg plant(-1) and 0.14 mL h(-1) plant(-1), and those of LND1 and LND2 were increased by 31.4 and 24.5%, 6.4 and 32.9% compared with LND3, respectively. The ureide content and N accumulation of soybean organs in LND1 and LND2 were higher than those of LND3. The N uptake, NUE and N agronomy efficiency (NAE) of IMS under CN were 308.3 kg ha(-1), 28.5%, and 5.7 kg grain kg(-1) N, respectively; however, those of LN were significantly increased by 12.4, 72.5, and 51.6% compared with CN, respectively. The total yield in LND1 and LND2 was increased by 12.3 and 8.3% compared with CN, respectively. Those results suggested that LN with distances of 15-30 cm from the topdressing strip to the maize row was optimal in maize-soybean intercropping. Lower N input with an optimized fertilization location for IMS increased N fixation and N use efficiency without decreasing grain yield."

However, there are limited references concerning rice/legume mix-cropping in paddy fields. An aquatic leguminous plant, water mimosa (Neptunia oleracea Lour.), was introduced and a related field experiment of two seasons (early and late seasons in 2019) was carried out to explore the effects of rice/water mimosa mix-cropping on rice growth, yield, grain quality and soil nutrients in the present study. Three treatments - rice monocropping, rice/water mimosa intercropping and mix-cropping - were employed in this study. RESULTS Results showed that rice grew better with greater height, tiller number, chlorophyll content, actual photosynthetic efficiency [Y(II)], maximum photochemical efficiency (F-v/F-m) and photochemical quenching coefficient (qP) in the intercropping and mix-cropping treatments. In addition, the intercropping and mix-cropping treatments increased nutrient uptake of nitrogen (N) by11.89-24.42%, phosphorous (P) by 17.75-36.61% and potassium (K) by 19.22-47.44%, and rice yield by 19.9% and 21.8%. Conversely, the non-photochemical quenching coefficient (NPQ), chalkiness degree and chalky rate of rice were lower in the intercropping and mix-cropping treatments relative to those in the monocropping treatments. Notably, soil alkali-hydrolysable N (AN), available P (AP) and K (AK) contents were the highest in the mix-cropping treatments among the three cropping systems. CONCLUSION We suggest that rice/water mimosa mix-cropping is an environmentally friendly agroecological system with a higher output and can be extended for green rice production and largely applied in the paddy field.

Integrated Application of Poultry Manure and Chemical Fertiliser on Soil Chemical Properties and Nutrient Uptake of Maize and Soybean	MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article						"Intercropping; chemical fertiliser; NPK; poultry manure; soil chemical properties"	"ORGANIC FERTILIZER; YIELD; GROWTH; MANAGEMENT; TOMATO"	Low soil fertility due to monoculture cereal production systems and inadequate fertiliser application are some of the major causes for declining crop production in developing countries. Integrated use of organic and inorganic fertilisers is an option to alleviate soil fertility problem as it utilises available organic and inorganic nutrients for sustainable agricultural production and productivity. A field experiment was conducted in 2014 at Universiti Putra Malaysia to evaluate the effect of the integrated application of poultry manure and inorganic fertiliser on soil chemical properties and nutrient uptake of maize and soybean in maize-soybean intercropping. Treatments comprised combinations of three cropping systems (sole maize, sole soybean, and maize + soybean) and four fertilisation regimes (control, 100% NPK, 100% poultry manure (PM) and 50% NPK + 50% PM). The experiment was laid out in a randomised complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. Results showed that either growing soybean alone or as an intercrop with maize resulted in increased soil organic matter (OM) (P<0.05), total N (P<0.0001), soil available P (P<0.0001) and soil cation exchange capacity (CEC)(P<0.05). Intercropping maize with soybean significantly reduced N, P and K uptake of soybean (P<0.0001), but uptake of N, P and K by maize was not significantly (P>0.05) affected by intercropping. Application of 100% PM and integrated application of 50% NPK+50% PM gave significantly higher soil pH (P<0.001), soil OM (P<0.0001), soil total N(P<0.0001), soil available P (P<0.0001), soil exchangeable K (P<0.001) and soil CEC(P<0.0001) compared to control and 100% NPK. For both maize and soybeans, the highest uptake of N, P and K was observed from the integrated application of 50% NPK+50% PM (P<0.0001). It can be concluded that integrated application of organic and inorganic fertiliser is the best option to improve soil chemical properties and nutrient uptake of maize and soybean.	"[Almaz, M.

Thus, this study aims to identify adaptive maize-based systems with high productivity, increased profitability, and enhanced soil fertility for the tropical rainforest of Nigeria. We evaluated four maize-based systems, comprising of sole maize; maize/cowpea intercrop; maize/groundnut intercrop; and maize/sweet potato intercrop for higher productivity, profitability, and soil fertility. Results showed that the system productivity of maize/sweet potato intercrop (4.2 t ha(-1)) was significantly higher (P = 0.05) than those of maize sole (2.6 t ha(-1)); maize/cowpea (3.5 t ha(-1)); and maize/groundnut (3.0 t ha(-1)). Also, maize/sweet potato ($ 1081 ha(-1)) significantly increased the net income in terms of monetary profits compared to those of maize sole ($ 557 ha(-1)); maize/cowpea ($ 882 ha(-1)); and maize/groundnut ($ 699 ha(-1)). However, the net benefit-cost ratio of maize/sweet potato (2.47) and maize/cowpea (2.35) was similar. The effect of cowpea, when intercropped with maize, significantly increased the total nitrogen (N) content and available phosphorus (P) in soil by about 22% and 6-12%, respectively, compared to those of maize sole, and maize/sweet potato and maize/groundnut. Here, we conclude that the intercropping of maize with sweet potato and/or cowpea in this agroecosystem is an adaptive and resilient system, which is capable of meeting the food, nutrition, and income stability of farmers while maintaining the soil health. Crop diversification through intercropping can contribute to agroecological balance and maintenance of the soil ecosystem services."

In tropical regions, forage grasses are increasingly being adopted as winter pasture intercropped and in rotation with maize to maximize food production. However, current recommendations for nitrogen (N) fertilizer application are based on monocropped maize (Zea mays), and the best N management approach for intercropping systems remains unclear. A field experiment was carried out in three growing seasons with three intercropping systems [monoculture maize, intercropped with palisadegrass (Urochloa brizantha), and intercropped with guineagrass (Megathyrus maximus)] combined with six different split applications of N to maize (0-0, 100-0, 70-30, 50-50, 30-70, and 0-100 kg N ha(-1) at seeding-sidedressing) with four replicates. We measured dry matter (DM) and accumulated N in maize and forage grasses, as well as maize production components and yields. Additionally, land equivalent ratio, relative crowding coefficient, aggressivity of maize with forage grasses, forage crude protein (CP) concentration, estimated animal stocking rate, and estimated meat production and economic outcomes. Greatest maize yield was 8.7 Mg ha(-1) for monocropped maize. However, favorable maize yield was also obtained in intercropping systems. Although no difference was observed between intercropping systems, applying all N at sidedressing of maize negatively affected maize and forage yields and, consequently, land use and economic evaluation. For both intercropping systems, estimated meat and land use were 114 and 10% higher when N fertilizer was applied than the control (0-0 kg N ha(-1)), on average. Maize-forage grass intercropping is a viable alternative production system for improving yields and land use. In addition, estimated meat production and revenue can be enhanced with palisadegrass or guineagrass. At least half of the N fertilizer must be applied early in the growing season of maize to maximize production of the entire system.	"[Crusciol, Carlos A.

TMR (436 g kg(-1) dry matter (DM)) was ensiled with six experimental treatments: (1) no additives (control); (2) molasses (M); (3) an inoculant (Lactobacillus plantarum) (L); (4) propionic acid (P); (5) molasses + propionic acid (MP); (6) inoculant + propionic acid (LP). RESULT: All silages were well preserved with low pH (< 4.19) and NH3-N contents, and high lactic acid contents after ensiling for 45 days. L and PL silages underwent a more efficient fermentation than silages without L. P and MP silages inhibited lactic acid production. Under aerobic conditions, M and L silage reduced aerobic stability for 15 and 74 h, respectively. All silages that had propionic acid in their treatments markedly (P < 0.05) improved the aerobic stability. After 72 h incubation, all additives treatments increased (P < 0.05) the 72 h cumulative gas production and in vitro DM digestibility (IVDMD) as compared with the control. L treatment decreased (P < 0.05) in vitro neutral detergent fibre degradability. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that TMR prepared with oat-common vetch intercrop can be well preserved. Although propionic acid is compatible with lactic acid bacteria, and when used together, they had minor effects on fermentation, aerobic stability and in vitro digestibility of TMR silage prepared with oat-common vetch intercrop.

Intercropping on Plant Growth and Soil Chemical Characteristics in Saline Soil	AGRICULTURE-BASEL			English	Article						"maize; intercropping; Suaeda salsa; saline soil"	"USE EFFICIENCY; SALT; MAIZE; YIELD; WHEAT; RHIZOSPHERE; NITROGEN"	Halophytes possess the capacity to uptake high levels of salt through physiological processes and their root architecture. Here, we investigated whether halophyte/non-halophyte intercropping in saline soil benefits plant growth and contains root-dialogue between interspecific species. Field and pot experiments were conducted to determine the plant biomasses and salt and nutrient distributions in three suaeda (Suaeda salsa)/maize (Zea mays L.) intercropping systems, set up by non-barrier, nylon-barrier, and plastic-barrier between plant roots. The suaeda/maize intercropping obviously transferred more Na+ to the suaeda root zone and decreased salt and Na+ contents. However, the biomass of the non-barrier-treated maize was significantly lower than that of the nylon and plastic barrier-treated maize. There was lower available N content in the soil of the non-barrier treated groups compared with the plastic barrier-treated groups. In addition, the pH was lower, and the available nutrient content was higher in the nylon barrier, which suggested that rhizospheric processes might occur between the two species. Therefore, we concluded that the suaeda/maize intercropping would be beneficial to the salt removal, but it caused an adverse effect for maize growth due to interspecific competition, and also revealed potential rhizospheric effects through the role of roots. This study provides an effective way for the improvement of saline land.

Intercropping did not affect the maize yield, but the yields of mungbean were greatly affected. The maximum and minimum yields of iiiungbean were obtained in a mungbean monoculture plot and mungbean intercropped with a high-density maize plot, respectively. The leaf photosynthetic rate of maize in different plots was insignificant. That of mungbean, however, was significantly affected, and it decreased under the higher density plot. The total dry matter production in per unit area increased due to intercropping. The crop growth rate (CGR) and net assimilation rate (NAR) of maize were highest in the low-density plot and total the CGR and NAR were also highest in the low-density plot at later stages of growth. Land equivalent ratios (LER) were higher than 1.0 in all intercrop plots and crop performance ratio (CPR) was higher than 1.0 only in low-density plot.

Rational maize (Zea mays L.) based intercropping with legumes/oilseed rape across six experimental sites from 2008 to 2017 proved advantageous over monoculture in terms of both maize biomass production and P uptake. The partial land equivalent ratio (PLER) for P uptake by intercropped maize averaged from 0.58 to 0.92, which was significantly higher than that for biomass production (0.51-0.78), indicating that the advantage of P acquisition by intercropped maize was superior to that of biomass accumulation. It was the excessive accumulation of P in intercropped maize compared to monoculture, especially higher P concentrations in grains that led to the superior P acquisition advantage and luxury absorption of P. P concentrations in maize grains were significantly increased from 1.89-2.91 mg kg(-1) in monoculture to 2.09-3.65 mg kg(-1), in intercropping, by 8.3%-25.5%. The plant internal P use efficiency of maize was significantly decreased from the initial 411.7-775.7 kg kg(-1) in monoculture to 345.7-710.4 kg kg(-1) in intercropping by 4.9%-16.0%, and 100 kg maize grain P quantities were significantly increased from 0.25-0.46 kg to 0.27-0.54 kg by 7.0%-17.4%. Rational fertilizer P input maximized maize yields and P use without decreasing the interspecific ecological advantages and harvest indexes of grain yields and P. These findings promoted better understanding of P allocation status within maize plants, and yield and P acquisition advantages through the exploitation of the biological potential of plants for the efficient utilization of P resources in diverse species combinations.

Three irrigation depths, 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 mm; and two mulch levels, zero mulch and 10 ton/ha of oil palm bunch refuse as mulch material were employed, while the third option involved the combination of the different levels of irrigation and mulching. These were used alongside fertilizer application. The pertinent growth and yield parameters were then determined. Results of the analysis indicated that there were no significant differences in growth parameters such as plant height, vine length and days to 50% flowering across the treatment variants. Yield components such as total grain yield, total fresh cob yield and total fruit yield differed greatly across the treatment options and also indicated significance at the 1% probability level. It was observed that cucumber total fruit yield was greater in the plots that received only mulching than the other plots. The results of the study highlight the position that the best crop yields would be obtained for maize and cucumber intercrop during the dry season, if farmers resort to optimum application levels while using the synergy of irrigation and mulching to achieve a crop favorable soil moisture regime."

Samples of 0.10 m width, 0.20 m length, and 0.25 m thickness were collected from five random locations of each experimental area and, for the visual evaluation of soil structural quality, a soil evaluation (VESS) chart was used so that visual scores were attributed to each sample. Treatments 1 and 5 received the highest scores, while treatment 3 had the lowest score and showed good structural quality and great root presence. At the superficial layer, treatment 2 had the lowest score (0.8) among treatments. For the subsuperficial layer, the scores obtained were higher than those found for the superficial layer: T3 had the lowest mean (1.5) and was significantly similar to T4 that presented a mean score of 1.7. Except for T1, which showed a similar score to non-intercropping maize (T5), the forage grasses had better visual scores. The visual evaluation of soil structure indicated that maize and forage grasses intercropping improves soil structural quality.

Maize cv. 'HGT 3' in solid sowing gave more green-forage yield (47.30 tonnes/ha), followed by 'African Tall' (44.9 tonnes/ha) in both the years. Maize and cowpea production in solid sowing and total production from maize and cowpea in 1 : 1 row proportion were statistically at par. 'HGT 3' in 2 : 2 row proportion with 'EC 4216' cowpea was found to be an ideal forage - intercropping system for more yield and better quality during the lean summer months.

In southern Mexico, the cereal-legume intercropping is a traditional cropping practice that is declining overtime. This paper provides a literature review of the potential benefits and constraints of a maize-legume intercropping for small-scale farms in southern Mexico. This review explored and elucidated the different ecosystem services delivered by maize-legume intercropping systems. This information will help farmers know how to make a better use of cereal-legume intercropping systems to increase maize yields, improve their socioeconomic conditions, and enhance conservation agricultural practices in southern Mexico.

It aimed to make compatible the exploitation of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala Lam. de Wit) intercropped with maize, bean and cotton, without causing, however, significative changes in the production systems being used by small holders. Seedlings were planted with a spacing of 2,5 m between rows and 1,0 m between plants, both in the sole crop and intercrop. In the intercropping systems crops were planted between the rows of leucaena. Plants were pruned (leaves + branches with a diameter lesser than 0,5 m) as they came to flowering and every year, at the beginning of rainy season, leucaena plants were cut 0,20 m above soil and the crops were planted. In the second year, there was no difference in the behavior of leucaena in sole crop and intercrop. Leucaena yielded about 9,000 kg of dry matter/ba/year, corresponding to about 2,500 kg of crude protein. Bean and maize yields were expressive. Nevertheless, the use of cotton revealed to be inadvisable.

Results from pot experiment showed that the root growth of peanuts were significantly inhibited at 25% soil water content compared to those at 15% soil water content. The chlorophyll content in the new leaves of intercropped peanut decreased and leaves became chlorotic at 25% soil water content. There were no significant differences in the active iron concentration in new leaves of peanut between 15% and 25% soil water content. The soil pH were higher in peanut rhizosphere than in bulk soil at the early, middle, and, harvest stages for both 15% and 25% soil water content. The soil bicarbonate content was also higher in peanut rhizosphere than in bulk soil for both 15% and 25% soil water content. There was significant difference in soil bicarbonate of peanut rhizosphere between 15% and 25% soil water content at the harvest stage. The available iron content in both rhizosphere soil and bulk soil were lower than 3.5 mg kg(-1) in all growth stages at both 15% and 25% soil water content. Results from rhizobox experiment showed that citric acid, maleic acid, and fumaric acid in exudates of peanuts significantly increased at 25% soil water content compared to that at 15% soil water content. The apoplastic iron content of peanut roots decreased by 0.216 and 0.409 mumol g(-1) fresh weight(-1) (FW) from the 28th growth day to 42nd growth day at 25% and 15% soil water content, respectively. The mobilizing ability of apoplastic iron in intercropped peanuts at 15% soil water content was 20.1% higher compared to that at 25% soil water content. It is concluded that improvement of iron nutrition of peanuts with intercropping with maize could be affected by soil moisture condition.

Under controlled conditions, both bean and maize exudates stimulated rhizobial survival, growth, and nod gene inducing activity, bean nodulation and N accumulation in tissues, and Azospirillum lipoferum survival. After two years with bean and maize in monoculture or intercropped,Azospirillum spp. population was high and did not differ between treatments, while Rhizobium tropici, nitrite oxidizers and soil biomass were favored by bean plants. Rhizobium etli represented, on average, 15% of rhizobial population, except for soils with maize grown alone, where this species was absent, predominating Rhizobium spp., which nodulate exclusively leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala). Soil extracts from the intercropped system showed higher content of nod gene inducing phenolic compounds. Mycorrhizal spore number was not affected by the treatments, although bean in monoculture favored species diversity.

This study investigated the effect of 30 kg ha(-1) P fertilizer and improved bean cultivars on intercrop yields and bean BNF (measured by the N-difference method) at two sites with nutrient deficient soils typical of high altitude cropping systems in Malawi. Following farmer practice, maize was the dominant crop of the intercrop and bean a low density 'bonus' crop. Phosphorus application to the maize/bean intercrop consistently enhanced maize and bean yields and BNF. Yields of the improved cultivars were about 150% higher than farmer cultivars at both 0 and 30 kg P ha(-1). BNF was increased by about 90% in improved cultivars compared to farmer cultivars, with the exception of one site in 1996/97, A trial conducted at nine sites on-farm was used to evaluate a fertilizer strategy of P (30 kg ha(-1)) and N (30 kg ha(-1)) applied to a maize/bean intercrop versus sole maize. Yields and economic evaluation indicated high mean net benefits for an average cost/price scenario for fertilizer application to maize/bean intercrop: net benefit was US$192 ha(-1), compared to unfertilized sole maize, net benefit US$62 ha(-1). Net benefit for fertilizing sole maize was US$86 ha(-1). Fertilizing maize/bean intercrops is a promising technology for smallholder farmers in upland, P-deficient soils, in areas where beans as a sole crop are not valued sufficiently to be fertilized by subsistence farmers.

Although some studies have examined the effects of varying seeding ratios, the optimum seeding rates for those combinations are not well-defined. The objective of this study was to compare the yields from mixed stands of vetch (principal species) and oat (secondary species) obtained when several seeding rates of vetch were combined with various seeding ratios of the two species. A field study was conducted at two locations near Madrid in the 1981-82 and 1982-83 growing seasons. Both species were planted as monocrops and in mixtures. Ratios of the number of vetch to oat seed were 100:0; 90:10; 80:20; 70:30 and 60:40. Within each mixture, seeding rates of vetch were 60, 80, 100 and 120 kg ha-1. The oat monocrop was seeded at 140 kg ha-1. Plants were harvested at the pod-setting stage of vetch. Relative yield total (RYT) calculated as the sum of the relative dry matter yields of both species was used as the criterion for mixed stand advantage. Mixtures produced 34% more dry matter than the monocrop of vetch, but 57% less than the oat monocrop. Dry matter yields of mixtures were not affected by seeding ratio or seeding rate of vetch but proportions of vetch dry matter decreased linearly as the percentage of oat seed in the mixture increased. The net effect of oat in the mixture was a linear increase in competition as oat density increased. Relative yield totals of mixtures with 90:10 or 80:20 ratios of vetch:oat seed exceeded unity."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of glyphosate herbicide in the suppression of Brachiaria (signalgrass) intercropped with maize. The experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design with four replications. The treatments were arranged in a 5 x 2 + 2 factorial arrangement, the first factor corresponding to the doses of glyphosate (48, 96, 144, 240, 480 g ha(-1) of the acid equivalent (a.e)) and the second one to the vegetative stages of the signalgrass at the time of application (2 and 4 tillers). Two controls were added to the treatment list, comprising controls without herbicide application and hand removal of the signalgrass. The number of plants, tillers and dry matter of signalgrass was reduced with glyphosate. The increase of the glyphosate doses enhanced the injure to the forage plants, mainly when the compound was sprayed at the two-tiller vegetative stage. The dry matter of maize plants increased proportionally to the glyphosate dose. However, the height of the maize plants was not affected. The grain mass and productivity of maize grain increased with increasing dose of glyphosate. The maize yield was negatively influenced on the untreated control. Glyphosate at 96 and 144 g ha(-1), when applied at 2 and 4 tiller stage, respectively, reduces the growth of signalgrass and does not affect the maize grain yield.

In order to assess the performance of various intercropping modes of maize and alfalfa, a field experiment was conducted in a completely randomized block design with five treatments: maize monoculture in even rows, maize monoculture in alternating wide and narrow rows, alfalfa monoculture, maize intercropped with one row of alfalfa in wide rows and maize intercropped with two rows of alfalfa in wide rows. Results demonstrate that maize monoculture in alternating wide and narrow rows performed best for light transmission, grain yield and output value, compared to in even rows. When intercropped, maize intercropped with one row of alfalfa in wide rows was identified as the optimal strategy and the largely complementary ecological niches of alfalfa and maize were shown to account for the intercropping advantages, optimizing resource utilization and improving yield and economic incomes. These findings suggest that alfalfa/maize intercropping has obvious advantages over monoculture and is applicable to the farming and pastoral areas of northeast China.

Maize (Zea mays L.) was supplied with 50, 75 and 100% of the recommanded fertilizer levals, whereas blackgram (Phaseolus mungo L.) and hoursegram [Macrotyloma uniflorum (Lam.) Verdcourt] were supplied with 0, 50 and 100% of the recommended fertilizer levesl in intercroping systems. Though maize yield was decreased when intercropped with horsegram but generally gave higher maize-equivalent yield than maize + blackgram system. For obtaining higher net returns, no fertilizer should be applied to blackgram but additional 50% of recommended fertilizer to horsegram should be applied in maize + horsegram intercropping system.

Maize yields were significantly reduced (P<0.05) by intercropping with beans. On the other hand, bean yields improved as the rates of N increased peaking at 75 Kg N/ha. Intercropping, however, significantly (P<0.05) reduced the bean yields (pods per plant). Intercropping maize with beans under different N fertilizer regimes increased the food output per unit land as measured by Land Equivalent Ratios 9% (lowest) to 97% (highest).

The contribution of dry root matter in the soil profile allows the improvement of soil structural quality. The objective of this research was to evaluate changes in soil physical and physico-hydric properties with the cultivation of maize grown alone and intercropped with Brachiaria brizantha. The study was carried out on the Experimental Farm Lageado (UNESP, Botucatu-SP) in the growing seasons 2002/2003 and 2003/2004. Undisturbed soil was sampled from the layers 0-20 and 20-40 cm by volumetric rings in plots growing maize and left fallow between harvest and in plots intercropped with maize and B. brizantha in the row, where the grass was maintained for grazing after maize harvest. The least limiting water range (LLWR) of these samples was evaluated, based on curves of penetration resistance and water retention in soil samples with different bulk densities. Maize grown alone is sufficient to improve the physical and structural characteristics of the soil in the 0-20 cm layer. Brachiaria intercropped with maize for two years improves the soil physical and structural properties in the layer 20-40 cm as well, reducing penetration resistance and increasing bulk density.

LEVELS OF NUTRIENTS AND GRAIN YIELD OF MAIZE INTERCROPPED WITH SIGNALGRASS (BRACHIARIA) IN DIFFERENT ARRANGEMENTS OF PLANTS	PLANTA DANINHA			English	Article						"Nicosulfuron; competition in intercropping; cropping spacing"	"COMPETITION; BRIZANTHA; QUALITY; CORN"	Competition between maize and signalgrass can economically cripple the intercropping by the reduced yield of maize and dry matter content of the forage. In seeking to define plant arrangements which make this system more efficient, this research was held with the objective of assessing the effects of interference of densities of signalgrass (Urochloa Brizantha) on nutrition and on maize grain yield. Two field experiments were conducted in a randomized block design with four replications. Treatments were arranged similarly in both experiments, in a 2 x 4 factorial design, the first factor being the dose of Nicosulfuron herbicide applied (0 and 8 g ha(-1)) and the second factor being the forage seeding rates (0, 2, 4 and 6 kg of seeds per hectare). The interference of signalgrass reduced foliar nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus content in maize plants intercropped with the forage. Higher values of grain yield were observed with the reduction of the spacing and the application of the recommended herbicide underdose (8 g ha(-1)). It was concluded that, regardless of the seeding density of U. Brizantha, reducing the maize seeding inter-rows spacing, combined with the application of an underdose of Nicosulfuron, caused a positive effect by reducing the initial forage growth, resulting in less interference of Urochloa brizantha on nutrient uptake by the maize plants and grain yield of the crop.

J	"Singh, SN; Chaudhary, DC"				"Singh, SN; Chaudhary, DC"			Effect of intercropping maize (Zea mays) varieties on autumn-planted sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum)	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article								A field experiment was conducted during autumn season of 1988-89 and 1989-90 to screen suitable maize (Zea mays L.) variety best suited to intercropping in autumn-planted 'CoS 8315' sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) for its effect on growth, yield, quality of cane and subsequently on economic returns. Irrespective of cane alone treatment, significantly higher number of tillers, millable canes and cane yield were recorded under sugarcane + 'Jaunpuri' and 'CD Pool' maize over others. Though all the maize varieties gave higher cane-equivalent yield and net returns except 'Opaque' as compared to sugarcane alone, but amongst them, 'CD Pool' was found to be promising giving highest cane-equivalent yield (123.73 tonnes/ha) and net returns (Rs 26,750/ha). This increase was 24.61% more than the sugarcane alone. Maize variety 'Opaque' as an intercrop reduced the cane yield significantly, resulting in a net loss of returns up to 5.21% compared with sole crop of sugarcane. No significant effect on juice quality parameters were noticed due to intercrops.

Integrated Control of Busseola fusca Fuller in Maize Crops	DISCOVERY AND INNOVATION			English	Editorial Material						"Busseola fusca; stalkborer; intercrops; timely planting; intergrated"		Studies were conducted in the facilities of Moi University to determine the appropriate rates of Bestox and Brigade that were most efficacious in controlling larvae of the borer, B. fusca. Also investigated was how intercropping of maize and cowpea and precise timing of planting could be manipulated for farmers use. It was established that a single spray of 7.5 gactive ingredient of Bestox when precisely applied was significantly adequate. It controlled the stalkborer effectively and increased crop yield. A maize cowpea intercrop significantly (P=0.05) deterred infestation and when intercrops were planted early, the crop matures free of borer attack as it avoided coinciding of the voracious generation with susceptible stages of the crop. The components studied can form a sound basis for proposing in integrated control stratefy for use by farmers.

A study was conducted to analyze smallholder maize farmers' perception of climate change/variability and identify their adaptation approaches and barriers for adaptation in the eastern highlands of Ethiopia. Meteorological data were assessed to provide evidence of the perceived change. A survey was conducted in six major maize-producing kebeles with a total of 364 respondents. A multi-stage sampling method was employed for selecting the sample units for the study. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and a multinomial logit model. The results indicated that 78% of the sampled smallholder maize farmers perceived increasing temperatures while 83% perceived decreasing amounts of rainfall. About 75% of the farmers indicated that they became aware of climate change and variability from their own experience and perceived deforestation as the main cause. The farmers perceived that drought, diseases and pests, dwindling soil fertility, and declining crop yields were the major impacts of climate change that affected maize production. The farmers' major adaptation practices include adjusting planting dates, using improved maize varieties, intercropping, recommended mineral fertilizers, supplementary irrigation, and soil and water conservation measures. Econometric analysis revealed that low educational level, shortage of land, large family sizes, age, lack of access to irrigation water, lack of access to credit, and lack of access to extension services were the most important barriers to climate change adaptation in the area. It is concluded that farmers cultivating maize in the study area have perceived climate change and use certain adaptation strategies to counter its negative impacts on maize production. This implies that policies should be geared towards strengthening farmers' efforts to adapt to climate change and alleviate the existing barriers in promoting adaptation strategies for enhancing the productivity of maize.

In a fluvisol soil, micro-watersheds with zero slopes were built at 1.6 m distance and 0.4 m high. Treatments were: conventional planting in furrows at 0.80 m (CP), planting in micro-watersheds (MW), with a row at one end and another at the edge, MW with a topological arrangement (MWT), with maize at the end and beans at the edge and MW planting maize in each slope (MWP). A completely randomized block experimental design with four replications was used. Rainfall at the experimental site was 398, 676 and 397 mm between July and September in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. In 2006 MW output was greater than CP (P<0.05) for maize (29 and 39 % grain and forage, respectively) and beans (40 %). In 2007 and 2008 MW yield was similar to CP (P> 0.05) and MWT maize yield improved on CP by 38 and 46 % in 2007 and by 34 and 39 % in 2008, in grain and forage, respectively, while MWP produced more maize forage (18 %) and grain (27 %) than CP (P<0.05). In the three research periods, lodging was observed in MW maize. MWT and MWP planting increases both maize and beans yield, improving water use efficiency in both grain and forage output.

Reduced Tillage and Intercropping as a Means to Increase Yield and Financial Return in the Drylands of Tigray, northern Ethiopia: A Case Study under Rainfed and Irrigation Conditions	MOMONA ETHIOPIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE			English	Article						"Tillage; Intercropping; Maize; Soybean; Tigray; Ethiopia"	"AFRICA; GROWTH; EAST"	"Intensive tillage is a major sustainability concern in cereal dominated cropping systems in the drylands of Tigray, Ethiopia. Hence, on-farm trials were conducted to investigate the yield and economic advantage of reduced tillage and intercropping for two seasons. A factorial experiment in a complete randomized block design was carried out at Adigudom located in Hintalo-Wajirat district in South-Eastern Tigray in 2014 (rain-fed) and 2015 (irrigated). The experiment consisted of four tillage frequencies (zero, one, two and four) and three types of cropping systems (sole maize, sole soybean and maize-soybean intercropping) in three/four replications. Maize, variety Melkassa 2, and soybean, variety Awassa 91 were used. Grain and biomass yields, and harvest index of both crops were analysed. Yield advantage of intercropping was evaluated using land equivalent ratio (LER) and partial budget analysis was used for the financial evaluation. The grain and biomass yields of both crops were significantly increased (p<0.05) as the tillage frequencies increased from zero to four in both seasons but the frequent tillage with sole cropping was not economically viable as the two times tillage with maize-soybean intercropping gave 126% greater net benefit compared to the four times tillage sole maize, which is practiced by farmers in the study area. The net benefit was strongly influenced by the main effects of tillage and intercropping in both seasons (p<0.001) and by their interaction in 2014 (p<0.05). Significantly higher LER (1.87-2.12) was recorded from maize-soybean intercropping over sole cropping in all the tillages and both seasons. Hence, two alternative options are suggested that farmers could apply in the drylands of Tigray: (i) keeping the sole cropping culture of maize production, and reducing number of tillages from 4 to 2 that would give 374% and 705% Marginal Rate of Return (MRR), respectively, under the rainfed and irrigated conditions compared to zero tillage sole maize; or (ii) intercropping maize with soybean and reducing tillage frequency from 4to 2 that would give 608% and 585% MRR in the respective growing seasons, compared to zero tillage maize-soybean intercropping. Taking these results into account, two times tillage combined with maize-soybean intercropping can be a good option in dryland areas of Tigray to achieve higher total intercrop yield at a low cost and larger LER. Moreover, reduced tillage can minimize soil degradation and benefit farmers with poor access to draft power or female-headed households constrained with labour for ploughing."

Rich) Stapf], provides large amounts of biomass that can be used as straw for no-tillage systems or as pasture for animal grazing. In addition, the use of narrow row spacing may increase maize grain yield. However, it is important to evaluate intercrops at different row spacing to avoid reductions in both maize and forage biomass production. The objectives of this field experiment during two growing seasons in Brazil were as follows: (1) to evaluate the influence of intercropping and row spacing on maize yield, leaf nutrient concentration, and plant population and development; and (2) to assess the influence of row spacing on palisade grass herbage mass and leaf nutrient concentration. The experimental design was a randomised complete block design in a 2 x 2 factorial scheme, with eight replications. The treatments comprised two row spacing distances (0.45 and 0.90 m) and two crop management types (maize monoculture and intercropped with palisade grass). The nutrient concentrations in the leaves of the maize plants were in the ideal range for this crop under all conditions studied. Plant height, height of first ear, and number of grains per ear were higher with the narrow row spacing. Maize grain yield was similar in both crop management types (10 301 and 9745 kg ha(-1) for monoculture maize and intercropped, respectively). However, maize grain yield at the narrow row spacing was higher than that obtained with the wide row spacing (9948 v. 8905 kg ha(-1)). In contrast, row spacing did not affect the nutrient level or quality (crude protein concentration) of palisade grass. The amount of dry matter (DM) from palisade grass was lower at maize harvesting (4.7 Mg ha(-1)) and 90 days after harvesting (6.9 Mg ha(-1)) under narrow spacing. However, the amount of DM was similar at both row spacings at 120 days after maize harvesting (9.2 Mg ha(-1)). Whenthere is no problem with water and nutrient availability, the use of maize and palisade grass intercropping under both row spacing conditions (0.45 and 0.90 m) provides an option for the production of forage DM without reducing the maize grain yield."

Prey and predator densities were determined when bean and maize plants were grown alone (monocultures) and when bean plants were intercropped with tall or short maize plants (dicultures). On bean plants, overall densities of aphids, leafhoppers, and thrips and their predators did not differ between mono- and dicultures. Higher numbers of the predators Orius insidiosus (Say) (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae) and Coleomegilla maculata (De Geer) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in maize than bean monocultures did not result in higher densities on bean plants in maize-bean dicultures. Only spiders and nabids (in some samples) were more abundant in dicultures. Data suggest that the predators do not aggregate in habitats with higher bean beetle densities. Nonetheless, the mortality of bean beetle larvae was density independent in bean monocultures and inversely density dependent in a maize-bean diculture. The results therefore suggest that predators have a greater effect on bean beetle populations in dicultures than in monocultures and they reinforce low bean beetle colonization in intercropped habitats.

The research was carried out at the Lavoura Seca Experimental Farm, of the Federal University of Ceara, in Quixada, in the State of Ceara, Brazil. Plants of the castor bean cv. BRS Energy were evaluated intercropped with cowpea cv. Setentao (I) or with maize cv. BRS 206 (II). The treatments consisted of combinations of two crops at two densities (5,000 and 10,000 castor bean plants per hectare; 20,000 and 40,000 intercropped plants per hectare), and two single crops, which were distributed into four randomised blocks. Crop productivity, land-use efficiency, competition index and the minimum requirements of the intercropped plants were evaluated. Productivity data were submitted to analysis of variance and mean values were compared by contrasting. Biological indices were interpreted from the partial values for land-use efficiency plotted on a Cartesian plane. The cropping systems affected productivity in the castor bean, cowpea and maize. An effect was also seen from the intercropping and population densities of the castor bean and intercrops on the indices of land-use efficiency and competition. Intercropping reduces productivity in the castor bean and the intercrops; between the cowpea and castor bean, intercropping is efficient in land use. When intercropping castor bean with maize, efficient land-use is only seen for the largest populations of the oilseed. Intercropping the castor bean with the cowpea, the dominant crop is influenced by crop density, whereas maize is more competitive than the castor bean."

In the case of maize, there is achance to combine production and biodiversity in the same field by microsegregation: wildflowers are sown between the future maize rows after harvest of the last main crop. These wildflower strips provide flowers and vegetation structure within fields and favour biodiversity without losing production area. The system is based on reliable cropping techniques such as strip-till, underground fertilization and band spraying, allowing the poor habitat quality of conventional maize caused by late soil tillage and lack of vegetation structure to be overcome. Field trials at two sites in Germany were conducted, testing the agricultural feasibility, ecological efficiency and yield impacts. The results show the successful establishment of the wildflower strips between the maize rows. Flowering diversity was up to eight times higher than in conventional maize crop stands. Positive implications for pollinators and ground beetles could be proved. The habitat quality for the skylark could be improved by a factor of2-3, to nearly normal reproduction of the population. Ayield reduction of at least 30% was observed. Further investigations will address this yield gap. Furthermore, the management of spontaneous weeds needs further improvement.

To counter these constraints, new cropping systems have been developed, including push-pull, rotations with promiscuous soybean varieties and green manure crops, and imidazolinone resistant- (IR-) maize. To analyze the technical and economic performance of these technologies, both with and without fertilizer, on-farm researcher-managed long-term trials were implemented over six seasons in two sites each in Vihiga and Siaya districts of Western Kenya. The economic results, based on marginal analysis using a multioutput, multiperiod model, show that the new cropping systems with fodder intercropping (push-pull) or soybean rotations were highly profitable. Push-pull is more profitable but requires a relatively high initial investment cost. Green manure rotation, IR-maize, and fertilizer all increased yields, but these investments were generally not justified by their increased revenue. We argue that research on rotation and cropping systems to tackle pest and soil fertility problems in Africa deserve more attention. This will require increased collaboration between agronomists and economists to set up long-term experiments with new cropping systems to develop proper economic models.

Enhancing energy and carbon efficiencies and reducing carbon footprints are important issues of sustainable development in modern agriculture. This study aimed to comprehensively assess energy and carbon budgeting and carbon footprints in wheat-maize intercropping, monoculture maize, and monoculture wheat with straw and plastic film management approaches, as based on a field experiment conducted in northwestern China. The results showed that intercropping had a greater grain yield by 12.8% and 131.0% than monoculture maize and wheat, respectively. Intercropping decreased energy and carbon inputs, increased energy and carbon outputs, thus improving energy and carbon efficiency, compared to monoculture maize. Intercropping reduced carbon footprint (CF) and yield-scale on the carbon footprint (CFy) via decreasing soil CO2 equivalent emissions over monoculture maize. For the intercropping treatments, NTSMw/NTm (no-tillage with straw mulching and residual plastic film re-mulching) and NTSSw/NTm (no-tillage with straw standing and residual plastic film re-mulching) treatments increased grain yields by 14.9% and 13.8% over CTw/CTm (conventional tillage with no straw returning and annual new plastic film mulching). The lower energy inputs and higher energy outputs were observed in NTSMw/NTm and NTSSw/NTm treatments, thus, NTSMw/NTm and NTSSw/NTm had greater energy use efficiency by 36.9% and 34.9% than CTw/CTm. NTSMw/NTm and NTSSw/NTm treatments decreased car-bon inputs and increased carbon outputs, thus improving carbon efficiency by 56.6% and 53.1%, compared to CTw/CTm. NTSMw/NTm and NTSSw/NTm treatments decreased CF by 16.8% and 14.3%, and decreased CFy by 27.6% and 24.8% compared to CTw/CTm, respectively, because of the decrease in soil CO2 equivalent emissions. Our study indicated that system productivity, as well as energy and carbon efficiencies were enhanced, and carbon footprints were reduced by NTSMw/NTm and NTSSw/NTm treatments, and NTSMw/NTm had a more robust effect, indicating this treatment is the most sustainable cropping system in arid areas.

Purpose Push-pull is an intercropping technology that is rapidly spreading among smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa. The technology intercrops cereals with Desmodium to fight off stem borers, eliminate parasitic weeds, and improve soil fertility and yields of cereals. The above-ground components of push-pull cropping have been well investigated. However, the impact of the technology on the soil microbiome and the subsequent role of the microbiome on diverse ecosystem benefits are unknown. Here we describe the soil microbiome associated with maize-Desmodium intercropping in push-pull farming in comparison to long-term maize monoculture. Methods Soil samples were collected from long-term maize-Desmodium intercropping and maize monoculture plots at the international centre for insect physiology and ecology (ICIPE), Mbita, Kenya. Total DNA was extracted before16S rDNA and ITS sequencing and subsequent analysis on QIIME2 and R. Results Maize-Desmodium intercropping caused a strong divergence in the fungal microbiome, which was more diverse and species rich than monoculture plots. Fungal groups enriched in intercropping plots are linked to important ecosystem services, belonging to functional groups such as mycorrhiza, endophytes, saprophytes, decomposers and bioprotective fungi. Fewer fungal genera were enriched in monoculture plots, some of which were associated with plant pathogenesis and opportunistic infection in humans. In contrast, the impact of intercropping on soil bacterial communities was weak with few differences between intercropping and monoculture. Conclusion Maize-Desmodium intercropping diversifies fungal microbiomes and favors taxa associated with important ecosystem services including plant health, productivity and food safety.

Effect of Intercropping Period Management on Runoff and Erosion in a Maize Cropping System	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							"AGGREGATE STABILITY; ORGANIC-CARBON; SOIL-EROSION; PHOSPHORUS; WATER; SEDIMENT; LOSSES; IMPACT; COVER"	The management of winter cover crops is likely to influence their performance in reducing runoff and erosion during the intercropping period that precedes spring crops but also during the subsequent spring crop This study investigated the impact of two dates of destruction and burial of a rye (Secale cereale L.) and ryegrass (Lolium multifloruni Lint) cover crop on runoff and erosion, focusing on a continuous silage maize (Zea mays L) cropping system Thirty erosion plots with various intercrop management options were monitored for 3 yr at two sues. During the intercropping period. cover crops reduced runoff and erosion by more than 94% compared with muffled, post-maize harvest plots Rough tillage after maize harvest proved equally effective as a late sown cover crop There was no effect of cover crop destruction and burial dates on runoff and erosion during the intercropping period. probably because rough tillage for cover crop burial compensates for the lack of soil cover During two of the monitored maize seasons. it was observed that plots that had been covered during the previous intercropping period lost 40 to 90% less soil compared with maize plots that had been left bare during the intercropping period The burial of an aboveground cover crop biomass in excess of 1 5 t ha (1) was a necessary, yet not always sufficient. condition to induce a residual effect.

Sowing dosages were: 7. 14 and 28 kg'ha ofseed at star gmss sowing. The height ofstar L not differ from the control with the three maize sowing dosages until the third cut. Star grass height was affected by sorghum (P < 0.001) in all-sowing dosages except for 7 kg of seeds/ha in the third cut. In the fourth and fifth cuts, there was not affect of the crops and the sowing dosage on star grass height. A similar performance was found in the covered by star grass. The number of stolons/m(2) in the first cut was higher (P, 0.001),when star grass was planted alone or with maize compared to any of the sorghum treatment. Yield (t/ha DM) in the 5 cuts was higher (P 0.001) when the star grass was planted alone or intercropped with maize compared to any of the sorghum treatment,;. Accumulated yield of star grass in five cuts (13.93 t/ha DM) washigher (P < 0.001) when it was intercropped with 7 kg of maize seeds/ha. The highest total yield (star grass crop). in the first two cuts. was obtained when forage sorghum was intercropped which differed (P < 0.001) from the control and from the star grass intercropped with maize. The opposite occurred in the 3(rd) and 4(th) cuts. In the fifth cut there was no effect. The cumulative to the yield in the five cuts. was highest (17-19 t/ha) in star grass (P < 0.001) when 14 and 28 kg of forage sorghum seed/ha were intercropped. It is concluded that in red ferrallitic soils, intercropping with the dosages or 7. 14 and 28 kg of seeds/ha does not affect star grass establishment. Total yield can increase when 7 kg of seeds/ha are used. Intercropping dosages, of 14 and 28 kg/ha of sorghum seeds can give a higher total biomass production. However. the use of only 7 kg of sorghum seeds/ha is suggested since this dose has less effect on star grass establishment with good biomass yield."

Intercropping stimulated proliferation of VA mycorrhizal fungi compared to monocropping with maize or soybean. In the soil cultivated with soybean there were more mycorrhizal propagules as compared to maize. Addition of organic amendments to soil increased the proliferation of VA mycorrhizal fungi. Of the three organic amendments studied, addition of pongamia leaf showed the highest increase of native mycorrhizal presence, followed by maize straw. Addition of rice straw to soil had the least stimulatory effect. Increase in the number of VA mycorrhizal propagules in soil was correlated with improved plant P uptake.	"[Harinikumar, K.

Growth of Bean Strip-Intercropped with Maize: Evaluation of the CROPGRO Model	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							"RADIATION-USE EFFICIENCY; PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS L.; CROPPING SYSTEMS; LIGHT INTERCEPTION; YIELD COMPONENTS; RESOURCE USE; LEAF-AREA; CORN; NITROGEN; DIFFUSE"	Optimizing strip-intercropping systems requires a comprehensive modeling approach to study competition effects, especially for solar radiation, and to integrate numerous crops. Therefore, we studied the radiation availability and its effect on canopy and leaf level and finally on total dry matter and yield formation of bush bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L. var. nana) strip-intercropped with maize. Nine rows of bush bean were sown on two sowing dates between strips of six rows of maize (Zea mays L.). The CROPGRO model was tested with an hourly input of solar radiation for its ability to simulate observed growth and yield formation of the two most shaded bush bean rows next to maize. Experimental results showed that bush bean had a good potential for strip-intercropping systems tolerating up to 30% shading due to an increased light interception by a larger canopy with a considerable increase in its leaf area. The CROPGRO model, calibrated on data of monocropped bush bean, captured well the effect of the strongly reduced radiation on total and pod dry matter in the most shaded bush bean row. This indicates the model's applicability on other intercropping systems exhibiting high levels of shading. Under a lower level of shading further from maize, cultivar parameters responsible for leaf area expansion and the maximum photosynthetic rate had to be increased to achieve a high accuracy of the simulations. Future studies should focus on measurements of photosynthesis, radiation distribution and absorption within the canopy, and leaf area expansion under shaded conditions to improve model simulations.

J	Subedi, KD				Subedi, KD			Profitability of barley and peas mixed intercropping in the subsistence farming systems of the Nepalese hills	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article							"WHEAT; SOLE"	Experiments were conducted during the winter seasons of 1992-93 and 1993-94 at the Lumle Agricultural Research Centre and its off-station research site at Lopre in Nepal to study the agronomic performance and profitability of barley (Hordeum vulgare) and peas (Pisum sativum) mixed intercropping (that is, without any row arrangement) in the subsistence farming systems of the Nepalese hills. Sole crops of barley (cv. Bonus and Local) at 100 kg seed ha(-1) were compared with a pure stand of peas (cv. Tikot Local) sown at 60 kg seed ha(-1) and with peas intercropped with both varieties of barley at 100:40 or 100:20 kg seed ha(-1). Results across two locations for two seasons showed that the barley + peas intercropping was advantageous in terms of overall grain yield, land equivalent ratio (LER), monetary advantage, economic return and dietary provision in the subsistence farming system. it also provided yield stability under adverse climatic conditions. Barley genotypes differed in their suitability for intercropping with peas. The yield of Local barley was reduced when peas were intercropped with it at both seed rates but this was not so with Bonus. The most appropriate combinations to realize the maximum advantage from intercropping were Bonus barley + peas at 100:20 kg seed ha(-1) and Local barley + peas at 100:40kg seeds ha(-1). A combination of Bonus barley and peas at 100:20 kg seed ha(-1) enabled farmers to harvest an additional 400 kg grains ha(-1) from peas without significantly reducing the grain yield of barley. The study also verified through formal experimentation that the traditional practice of mixing barley and peas is advantageous.

Ten plots of maize intercropped with Gliricidia sepium (MIG) and 10 traditional sole-maize (TSM) plots (0.2 ha each) were studied under farmer conditions from 2013/14 to 2017/18 in Salima District, central Malawi. The aim was to assess performance of MIG on soil fertility restoration and maize yield in degraded agricultural land. G. sepium trimmings were incorporated in MIG in October, January and September of every season. A total of 92 kg N ha(-1) was applied in both treatments. Soil and maize yield measurements were done from 10 m x 10 ridges centre of each plot and a paired t-test in R Statistical Software was used for data analysis. Organic matter (p < 0.001) and nitrogen (p < 0.011) were significantly higher in MIG than in TSM while bulk density was significantly lower (p < 0.006) in MIG than in TSM. Higher maize yield was achieved in MIG (5.52 t/ha) than in TSM (1.48 t ha(-1)) (p < 0.001). Nonsignificant differences between MIG and TSM fields for potassium (p > 0.678) and phosphorus (p > 0.149) suggests that the nutrients were not affected by presence or absence of G. sepium and may not have contributed to differences in yields. Effective gestation period for maize-gliricidia intercropping was at least two years where significant maize yields were first achieved. The findings in MIG provide farmers with sustainable agricultural option for soil health renewal and maize yield increase in central Malawi.

Merr.] intercropping system under rainfed conditions. Treatment comprised 2 cropping systems (maize sole and paired row planting maize + soybean) and 2 moisture-management practices (control and Kaolin 6% + organic mulch) in main plots, and 4 nutrient levels, viz. control, 50% recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF) + 50% recommended dose of nitrogen (RDN) through FYM, 50% RDF + 50% RDN through vermicompost and 100% RDF in sub plots of split plot design. However, maize-equivalent yield (3.47 t/ha) was the highest under paired row planting maize + soybean. The 100% RDF registered significantly higher grain yield (2.99 t/ha) of maize over control (2.03 t/ha) and 50% RDF+ 50% RDN through FYM (2.74 t/ha), 50% RDF+ 50% RDN through vermicompost (2.85 t/ha). Paired-row planted maize + soybean also registered more consumptive use (CU) of water (331.7 mm) than sole maize (324.6 mm). Moisture-conservation practices showed considerable variation in CU. Maximum water-use efficiency (WUE) was recorded with Kaolin 6% + organic mulch. Fertility levels also influenced the CU with highest value with100% RDF (330 mm) followed by 50% RDF + 50% RDN through vermicompost (329.1 mm). Significantly higher WUE was observed under paired row planted maize + soybean (10.9 kg/ha mm). Cropping systems altered the soil-moisture extraction pattern in all the 3 layers (0-15, 15-30 and 30-45 cm). Energy output, energy input and energy-use efficiency was higher in paired-row planted maize + soybean, Kaolin 6% + organic mulch and 100% RDF than their respective counterparts.

Here we develop a modelling method to simulate the growth of an intercrop taking into account the acquisition of light and water by the component species in order to calculate the efficacy of light and water acquisition in an intercropping system as compared to sole crops. The model is parameterized, calibrated and validated using data on wheat-maize intercropping in Gansu province, Northwest China. Observed above-ground biomass was 1630 g M-2 for sole wheat and 1334 g M-2 for intercropped wheat while it was 3023 g M-2 for sole maize and 2259 g M-2 for intercropped maize. The average water use was 405 mm in sole wheat, 595 mm in sole maize and 711 mm in wheat-maize intercropping. Based on observed yields, the land equivalent ratio (LER) was 1.59 and the water equivalent ratio (WER) was 1.14, where LER and WER express the relative amounts of land and water needed to achieve the yields obtained in a unit area of intercrop using sole crops. These results indicate that relay strip intercropping of wheat and maize achieves an increase of land use efficiency of 59% and of water use efficiency of 14%. Overall the intercrop model gave satisfactory predictions, with coefficients of efficiency (CE) in validation of 0.86-0.97, 0.90-0.95, 0.85-0.91 and 0.98 for biomass of sole wheat, sole maize, intercropped wheat, and intercropped maize, respectively. Overall CE of water use was 0.95. Simulated LER and WER were similar to observed LER and WER. The results show that intercropping could be used to obtain more yield on less land with less water. Policies that limit water use per unit land and prohibit the use of intercropping on the basis of its high water use per unit area may therefore be counter-productive. The model for intercrop growth and development under water limitation may be used for exploring production possibilities under land and water constraints.

An efficient intercropping of maize with mushroom has been developed in Northeast China. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of planting patterns on the diversity and structure of the soil bacterial communities at a 0-20 cm depth in the black soil zone of Northeast China. The experiment consisted of monoculture of maize and mushroom, and intercropping in a split-plot arrangement. The characteristics of soil microbial communities were performed by 16S rRNA gene amplicom sequencing. The results showed that intercropping increased soil bacterial richness and diversity compared with maize monoculture. The relative abundances of Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Saccharibacteria and Planctomycetes were significantly higher, whereas Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were lower in intercropping than maize monoculture. Redundancy analysis suggested that pH, NO3--N and NH4+-N contents had a notable effect on the structure of the bacterial communities. Moreover, intercropping significantly increased the relative abundance of carbohydrate metabolism pathway functional groups. Overall, these findings demonstrated that intercropping of maize with mushroom strongly impacts the physical and chemical properties of soil as well as the diversity and structure of the soil bacterial communities, suggesting this is a sustainable agricultural management practice in Northeast China.

Effect of combining organic manure and inorganic fertilisers on maize-bush bean intercropping	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article						"Cereal-legume cropping systems; Bush bean genotypes; Drought-tolerant bush bean; Organic manure; Inorganic fertiliser"	"PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS L.; PRODUCTIVITY; YIELD; EFFICIENCY; SYSTEMS"	In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), farmers intercrop common beans with maize but apply inorganic or organic fertilisers targeting only maize. Effects of this practice on bush bean yield have not been fully evaluated with respect to input use and compatibility when intercropped with maize. An on-farm trial managed by smallholder community members was conducted to assess the influence of various soil fertility management options and cropping systems on the yield of two bush bean genotypes (SER45 and SER83) in two agro-ecological zones of Malawi. The farmer-managed trials were laid out in split-plot design, with the bean genotypes as main plots and a combination of the soil fertility management options (i.e., no input, manure, fertiliser and fertiliser + manure) and cropping systems (i.e., sole crop and intercrop) as subplots. The trials were affected by terminal drought and dry spells, but results show that manure and fertiliser application enhanced the resilience of the drought-tolerant bean genotypes. The genotype SER45 was responsive to manure application in the sole crop, giving a 44.4% yield increase over no-manure application. In sole cropping with fertiliser plus manure, bean yields improved by 40.1% for SER45 and 78.3% for SER83 relative to the no-input control. Although sole cropping had higher bean yields, the treatment with manure and fertiliser had a higher land equivalence ratio for intercrop of 1.54 for SER45 and 1.32 for SER83 over sole cropping. These results show that, under smallholder farmer management, the climate adaptability of bush bean genotypes could be enhanced by the combined application of organic and inorganic fertilisers in maize-bean intercrop. The combined application also enhances whole-farm productivity of the common maize-bean intercrop practice than monocrop, hence is of benefit to most low-input smallholder farmers of SSA.

Yield is often constrained by inadequate nutrient availability even though the occurrence of soil water deficits may overall be more constraining. Research was conducted in semiarid Mali and Niger to determine the yield and profit responses of maize sole crop (MzSC) to N, P, and K and to develop a procedure for determining maize-groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) intercrop (MzGnI) nutrient response functions from MzSC functions. Trials were conducted in 2014 and 2015 at five locations spanning 14 degrees of longitude and two degrees of latitude. Mean MzSC grain yield increase due to 50 kg ha(-1) N was 0.69 Mg ha(-1) in Mali and 0.42 Mg ha(-1) in Niger, and due to 10 kg ha(-1) P was 0.14 Mg ha(-1) in Niger with inconsistent P effects in Mali. Responses to K were negligible. Productivity and profit potential with N application was more with MzGnI compared with MzSC, but profit potential for applied P and K were not improved with MzGnI. Considering the fodder value of stover added to production value but did not have much effect on profits from fertilizer use. The procedure for determining MzGnI nutrient response functions by adapting MzSC functions was developed, providing a means to improve fertilizer use efficiency for MzGnI. Productivity and returns to applied N, on a maize grain value equivalent, are greater with MzGnI compared to MzSC.

"COVER CROP; CORN PRODUCTION; PLANT-ROOTS; SOIL-WATER; TILLAGE; GROWTH; YIELD; AGGREGATION; PENETRATION; RESISTANCE"	The complex mutual interactions between soil properties and plants in high-biodiversity mono-cropping agro ecosystems have not been widely investigated. For this purpose, during 2009-2011, a stationary field experiment was conducted at the Experimental Station of the Aleksandras Stulginskis University to establish the effect of a multi-component agro-cenose (maize, living mulch, weeds) on the physical properties of the soil. Spring oilseed rape, white mustard, spring barley, Italian ryegrass, black medic, Persian clover and red clover were sown as living mulch into maize inter-rows. The stability of >1.0 mm aggregates increased between the beginning and end of the maize vegetative period in almost all of the crops containing living mulch. The greatest competition for moisture content between the inter-crops and maize was observed at the beginning of the vegetative period because of living mulches of long growing seasons using the most moisture. In many cases, the shear strength of the soil was significantly reduced by the living mulch in the middle of summer, when it covered the maize inter-rows. These findings show that the monocropping of maize with living mulch stabilises or improves the physical characteristics of the soil, highlighting its potential for sustainable maize growing.

The weeds which might otherwise build up before cassava covers the ground can be replaced by the cereal. The objective of this study was to determine effects of intercropping and fertilizer application on weed growth and crop performance in cassava and maize. Intercropping with N-fertilizer application gave the highest leaf area index and light interception and hence the best weed control, highest N, P and K uptake, total yields and land equivalent ratio. Intercropping with no N application made only a slight improvement in leaf area index, light interception and weed control over the corresponding sole cassava.

However, the effect of K on the competitive ability of grain legumes in legume/cereal intercropping systems has not been adequately studied. Hence, studies were made to ascertain if the effects of K could be exploited in improving the performance of groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) cv. No. 45 when intercropped with maize (Zea mays L.) cv. Badra. The study was conducted at the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Ruhuna, Kamburupitiya, Sri Lanka in 1988 in basins filled with 36 kg of soil. It involved establishing maize and groundnut as monocrops and as intercrops at three K levels viz. 0, 20 and 40 mg of K kg-1 of soil. Monocrop maize and groundnut had 2 and 5 plants/basin, respectively while the intercrop had 1 maize plant and 3 groundnut plants/basin. The soil used was Red Yellow Podzolic which was tagged by incorporating N-15-labelled plant material. When grown as a monocrop, K had no effect on the percent N derived from atmosphere, amount of N2 fixed, dry matter production, pod yield and total N content of groundnut. However, when intercropped with maize lack of K application affected the above parameters significantly which was overcome by improving K level. Thus, the optimum level of K for groundnut was greater when intercropped than monocropped. A significant interaction between K level and cropping system was evident with regard to N2 fixation, pod yield and total dry matter production of groundnut. Intercrop maize derived 30-35% of its N content from the associated groundnut plants which amounted to 13-22 mg N/plant. The amount of N supplied by groundnut to associated maize plant was not affected by K level. It appears that there is scope for alleviating growth depression of the legume component in legume/cereal intercropping systems by developing appropriate K fertilizer practices.

The effects of sole and intercropping of rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) were evaluated with soybean (Glycine max L.) and groundnut (Arachis hypogea L.) on crop yield, weed smothering efficiency (WSE) and nutrient (NPK) balance at Eastern Himalayan Region (EHR), India. Grain yield of maize was highest (3886 to 4110 kg ha(-1)) in the solitary system followed by maize-soybean intercrops at 1:2 rows. However, system productivity as well as production efficiency was higher by 47.3-63.3% and 39.5-58.4%, respectively in intercropping with groundnut at 1: 5 rows compared to solitarymaize. WSE was relatively higher to solitary soybean and was comparable to maize-groundnut intercropping at 1:5 row proportions. Similarly, NPK uptake was higher in intercropping of maize-soybean systems at 1:5 row proportions. Inclusion of legumes as intercrops in predominantly solitary rainfed maize may improve the system productivity while sustaining the nutrient availability in the vast uplands of the EHR and other similar rainfed hilly ecosystems.

Most studies have shown that intercropping can provide relief to crops against wind-dispersed pathogens. However, there was limited data on how the practice of intercropping help crops against soil-borne Phytophthora disease. Principal Findings: Compared to pepper monoculture, a large scale intercropping study of maize grown between pepper rows reduced disease levels of the soil-borne pepper Phytophthora blight. These reduced disease levels of Phytophthora in the intercropping system were correlated with the ability of maize plants to form a root wall that restricted the movement of Phytophthora capsici across rows. Experimentally, it was found that maize roots attracted the zoospores of P. capsici and then inhibited their growth. When maize plants were grown in close proximity to each other, the roots produced and secreted larger quantities of 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIMBOA) and 6-methoxy-2-benzoxazolinone (MBOA). Furthermore, MBOA, benzothiazole (BZO), and 2-(methylthio)-benzothiazole (MBZO) were identified in root exudates of maize and showed antimicrobial activity against P. capsici. Conclusions: Maize could form a root wall to restrict the spread of P. capsici across rows in maize and pepper intercropping systems. Antimicrobe compounds secreted by maize root were one of the factors that resulted in the inhibition of P. capsici. These results provide new insights into plant-plant-microbe mechanisms involved in intercropping systems.

In order to further understand the advantage mechanism of intercropping and the effect of increasing N application on the advantage effect of intercropped crop, a field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of different cropping patterns (i.e. M, maize monoculture; I1, maize-cotton intercrop; I2, maize-soybean intercrop) and N fertilization levels (N1, 100 kg ha(-1); N2, 200 kg ha(-1); N3, 300 kg ha(-1); N4, 400 kg ha(-1)) on maize (Zea mays L.) Results showed that intercropping and increasing N application could enhance green leaf area per maize plant and chlorophyll content, and differences in green leaf area per plant and chlorophyll content between intercropping and monoculture under N1 were significant. Intercropping and increasing N application could improve maize photosynthetic characters, but their effects would be decreased with increasing N fertilization level. Root bleeding sap rate and root DM of maize were also obviously affected by intercropping and N fertilization, and the differences in root bleeding sap rate and root DM between I2 and M under N1 and N2 were significant. Compared to M, under N1, N2, N3, and N4, I2 increased grain N content by 12.8%, 6.3%, 2.7%, 1.5%, respectively. Intercropping and increasing N application could increase maize yield, and the difference in yield between I2 and M under N1 was significant.

However, intercropping usually requires higher inputs of resources that emit more CO2. It is unclear whether an improved agricultural pattern could relieve this issue and enhance agricultural sustainability in an arid irrigation area. A field experiment using a well-designed agricultural practice was carried out in northwest China; reduced tillage, coupled with wheat straw residue retention measures, was integrated with a strip intercropping pattern. We determined the crop productivity, water use, economic benefits, and carbon emissions (CEs). The wheat-maize intercropping coupled with straw coveting (i.e., NTSI treatment), boosted grain yield by 27-38% and 153-160% more than the conventional monoculture of maize and wheat, respectively, and it also increased by 9.9-11.9% over the conventional intercropping treatment. Similarly, this pattern also improved the water use efficiency by 15.4-22.4% in comparison with the conventional monoculture of maize by 45.7-48.3% in comparison with the conventional monoculture of wheat and by 14.7-15.9% in comparison with the conventional intercropping treatment. Meanwhile, NTSI treatment caused 7.4-13.7% and 37.0-47.7% greater solar energy use efficiency than the conventional monoculture of maize and wheat, respectively. Furthermore, the NTSI treatment had a higher net return (NR) by 54-71% and 281-338% and a higher benefit per cubic meter of water (BPW) by 35-51% and 119-147% more than the conventional monoculture of maize and wheat, respectively. Similarly, it increased the NR and BPW by 8-14% and 1416% in comparison with the conventional intercropping treatment, respectively. An additional feature of the NTSI treatment is that it reduced CEs by 13.4-23.8% and 7.3-17.5% while improving CE efficiency by 62.6-66.9% and 23.2-33.2% more than the conventional monoculture maize and intercropping treatments, respectively. We can draw a conclusion that intercropping maize and wheat, with a straw covering soil surface, can be used to enhance crop production and NRs while effectively lowering CO2 emissions in arid oasis irrigation region."

To address these constraints, promising integrated crop management technologies were evaluated, using a multi-locational design in four sub-locations in Siaya and Vihiga district (western Kenya) for six cropping seasons. Technologies evaluated consisted of the traditional maize (Zea mays L.) - bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) intercrop, maize - Desmodium (Desmodium uncinatum (Jacq.) DC.) push-pull intercrop, Crotalaria (Crotalaria ochroleuca G. Don) - maize rotation, and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) - maize rotation. Within each of these systems, imazapyr-coated herbicide-resistant maize (IR-maize) and fertilizer were super-imposed as sub-plot factors. The push-pull system was observed to significantly reduce Striga emergence and stemborer damage from the second season onwards. IR-maize reduced and delayed Striga emergence from the first cropping season. Differences in Striga emergence and stemborer damage between the other systems were not significantly different. After five cropping seasons, the Striga seedbank was significantly higher in the maize-bean intercrop system than in the push-pull system under both maize varieties while the rotational systems had intermediate values not different from the day zero values. Under IR-maize, the Striga seedbank was significantly lower than under local maize for all cropping systems. Maize yields varied between seasons, districts, and cropping systems. Yields in the push-pull system were higher than in the maize-bean intercrop after two seasons and in the absence of mid-season drought stress. Both maize and soybean responded significantly to fertilizer application for both districts and for most seasons. The various interventions did not substantially affect various soil fertility-related parameters after five seasons. In the short term, IR-maize integrated in a push-pull system is the most promising option to reduce Striga while the rotational systems may need a longer timeframe to reduce the Striga seedbank. Finally, farmer-led evaluation of the various technologies will determine which of those is really most acceptable under the prevailing farming conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the knowledge on the options toward intensification of available practices in order to optimize systems productivity using intercrops is generally lacking. Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of intercropping, cropping seasons, and different varieties of common bean on productivity of the maize-common bean based intercrop through 5 cropping seasons from 2015 to 2017. Experimental site is located at 03 degrees 18'03.74' S and 37 degrees 12'13.94' E and an altitude of 956 m above sea level in the northern highlands of Tanzania. Hybrid maize Dekalb brand (DK 8031) and two varieties of common bean (improved Lyamungu 90 and local Mkanamna) were used. The treatments within a replicate were: (1) sole crops: (i) maize, (ii) local bean, (iii) improved bean, and (2) intercrops: (i) maize + local bean, (ii) maize + improved bean. Interaction and individual effects of cropping seasons (S) (periods of years - short and long rains), varieties of common bean (V), and cropping systems (C) (sole and intercrop) were studied. Results indicated that S x V interaction was significant on bean grain yield and 100seed weight. Improved bean outweighed the local bean with grain yields ranging from 2.2-3.5 t ha(-1) and 0.2-2.5 t ha(-1), respectively. The effect of S was significant on all measured variables in beans and the effect of M was only significant on total biomass. Further, S significantly affected all measured variables in maize and grain yields ranged from 2.3-2.6 t ha(-1). In maize, correlations were strong (r = 0.48*; P = 0.0325) between maize grain yield and ground coverage of leaf canopy measured 42-56 days after sowing. The land equivalent ratios (LERs) for maize intercropped with improved and local beans were 1.48 and 1.55, respectively but LER values did not differ significantly between bean varieties. In this study, both common bean varieties were sown simultaneously with the maize, which might have resulted in their differential performance. It is recommended that studies are conducted to evaluate time of introducing this legume crop to a maize system such as early sowing, sowing mid in the season after a maize crop is well established, and sowing late in the season when the leaves in maize plant have started to senesce."

J	"Salmeron, M; Cavero, J; Quilez, D; Isla, R"				"Salmeron, Montserrat; Cavero, Jose; Quilez, Dolores; Isla, Ramon"			Winter Cover Crops Affect Monoculture Maize Yield and Nitrogen Leaching under Irrigated Mediterranean Conditions	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							"NO-TILLAGE CORN; CROPPING SYSTEMS; SOIL-NITROGEN; MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES; NITRATE; FERTILIZATION; RYE; RECOVERY; QUALITY; WATER"	Under semiarid Mediterranean conditions irrigated maize (Zea mays L.) has been associated with nitrate pollution of surface water and groundwater. Cover crops grown during the intercrop period of maize could reduce N leaching. A 2-yr experiment was conducted in drainage lysimeters with three cover crops: barley (Hordeum vulgare L), winter rape (Brassica rapa L.), or common vetch (Vicia sativa L.). Bare soil was used as control treatment. Maize was fertilized with 300 kg ha(-1) N in the control, and this amount was reduced after a cover crop according to the N content in the aboveground cover crop biomass. Barley and winter rape biomass had a higher N content than vetch (130-170 vs. 50 kg ha(-1)). The vetch treatment did not reduce N leaching or affect maize yield. The barley and winter rape treatments reduced N leaching by 80% compared to the control (25 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) mainly due to a reduction of NO3-N concentration in drainage. Maize yield was reduced by 2.7 Mg ha(-1) after barley and winter rape but still high (approximate to 14 Mg ha(-1)). This reduction was due to an N deficiency caused by lower soil N in spring after the cover crop and insufficient N mineralization and/or lack of synchronization with maize N uptake. To use nonlegume winter cover crops to reduce N leaching in monoculture maize it is necessary to consider that N mineralization may not be sufficient to fulfill maize N requirements and N fertilizer adjustment tools should be developed.

To better understand the advantageous effect of intercropping, a pot and field experiment was conducted to evaluate the impact of maize-alfalfa intercropping on the plant and soil nutrient contents under nitrogen fertilization (N0 and N1 at 2.0 g pot(-1)and 225.0 kg hm(-2)) in Changchun, China. The results revealed that intercropping with or without nitrogen fertilizer application significantly (p < 0.05) improved the yield, biomass dry matter and plant-soil nutrient contents. The increased yield and biomass dry matter (140.7 and 268.7 g pot(-1)) and (38% and 25%) suggested the improved efficiency of the intercropping system with nitrogen in maize. Moreover, the nutrient concentration of maize and alfalfa such as nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) were also improved in the intercropping system under nitrogen fertilizer application. In general, the findings also indicated that maize-alfalfa intercropping with nitrogen fertilizer application significantly improved the soil-based N, P, K, and soil organic matter. The results suggest that the use of intercropping with reasonable nitrogen fertilizer application can improve the growth, yield, plant, and soil nutrient status.

Two sequential field trials were conducted in 2015 +/- 2016 to investigate the effect of shading on the morphological features, leaf structure, and photosynthetic characteristics of soybean in a maize-soybean relay-strip intercropping system. Three treatments were designed on the basis of different row configurations A1 (50 cm + 50 cm one row of maize and one row of soybean with a 50 cm spacing between the rows), A2 (160 cm + 40 cm two rows of maize by wide-narrow row planting, where two rows of soybean were planted in the wide rows with a width of 40 cm, and with 60 cm row spacing was used between the maize and soybean rows), and CK (sole cropping of soybean, with 70 cm rows spacing). Results showed that the photosynthetically active radiation transmittances of soybean canopy at V5 stage under A2 treatment (31.1%) were considerably higher than those under A1 (8.7%) treatment, and the red-to-far-red ratio was reduced significantly under A1 (0.7) and A2 (1.0) treatments compared with those under CK (1.2). By contrast with CK, stem diameter, total aboveground biomass, chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate decreased significantly except plant height under A1 and A2. The thickness of palisade tissue and spongy tissue of soybean leaf under A1 and A2 were significantly reduced at V5 stage compared with CK. The leaf thicknesses under A1 and A2 were lower than those in CK by 39.5% and 18.2%, respectively. At the R1 stage of soybean (after maize harvest), the soybean plant height, stem biomass, leaf biomass and petiole biomass under A1 and A2 treatments were still significantly lower than those under CK, but no significant differences were observed in Chl a/b, P-n, epidermis thickness and spongy tissue thickness of soybean leaves in A2 compared with CK. In addition, the soybean yields (g plant(-1)) under A1 and A2 were 54.69% and 16.83% lower than those in CK, respectively. These findings suggested that soybean plants can regulate its morphological characteristics and leaf anatomical structures under different light environments.

The aim of the study was to elucidate the short term effects of conservation agriculture (CA) systems on soil quality, crop productivity and profitability. In Balaka market and Ntonda sections of Manjawira Extension Planning Area (EPA), in Ntcheu district, central Malawi, we compared continuous monocropped maize (Zea mays) under conventional tillage practice (CP) with different CA systems in continuous monocropped maize (CAM) and intercropping with pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) (CAMP), Mucuna pruriens (CAMM), and Lablab purpureus (L) (Sweet) (CAML). The study was conducted from 2008 to 2011 in 72 plots in 24 farmers' fields. In Balaka market section CA plots with maize + legumes produced up to 4.3 Mg ha(-1) of vegetative biomass against 3.5 Mg ha for maize alone in CP. In Ntonda section CA plots with maize + legumes produced up to 4.6 Mg ha(-1) of vegetative biomass against 2.4 Mg ha(-1) for maize alone in CP. In both sections, during the entire study period. CA did not have a negative effect on crop yields. During the drier seasons of 2009110 and 2010/11, CA had a positive effect on maize grain yield at both sites (average yield of 4.4 and 3.3 Mg ha(-1) in CA and CP respectively). However, associating maize with legumes reduced maize yields compared to CAM particularly in drier years of 2009-10 and 2010-11. Farmers spent at most 47 days ha(-1) producing maize under CA systems compared to 65 days ha(-1) spent under conventional tillage practices. However, total variable costs were higher in CA systems compared to conventional practice (at most US$416 versus US$344 ha(-1)). CAMP resulted in more than double gross margin compared to CPM (US$705 versus uS$344 hat). Infiltration estimated as time to pond was highest in CA maize legume intercrops (8.1 s) than CP (6.8 s). Although it was not feasible to directly estimate effects on water balances of these farmer-managed experiments, it can be assumed that the yield differences between CA and CP could be attributed to tillage and crop residue cover since other farm operations were generally the same. Intercropping maize and pigeonpea under CA presents a win-win scenario due to crop yield improvement and attractive economic returns provided future prices of maize and pigeonpea grain remain favourable.

In 1996 fallow was followed by maize intercropped with cover crops of Pueraria phaseoloides, Mucuna pruriens or cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and no intercrop. Parameters measured included soil properties, ground cover, crop growth and yield, rainfall erosivity, runoff and soil loss. In spite of six-years of bush-fallow and establishment of cover crops, soil erosion was significantly greater on plots that had been conventionally cultivated previously using disc ploughs, harrows and mechanical rotovators (1.78 t ha(-1)season(-1)) compared to previously no-till plots (1.34 t ha(-1) season(-1)). Crop growth and yields were least and soil loss greatest (2.83 t ha(-1)season(-1)) on the previous bare plot. Maize grain yield was highest using Pueraria phaseoloides as an intercrop (2.15 t ha(-1)) followed by a cowpea intercrop (1.92 t ha(-1)), maize without intercrop (1.87 t ha(-1)) and Mucuna pruriens intercrop (1.71 t ha(-1)). The maize grain yields reflected levels of competition from the cover crops. Cowpea-maize intercrop may be most suitable for farmers because maize yields were satisfactory and cowpea grain serves as additional subsistence. Cowpea yields were 390 kg ha(-1). Soil erosion was also moderate using cowpea as an intercrop (1.71 t ha(-1)season(-1)). However, Pueraria phaseoloides gave the best erosion control with a soil loss of 1.34 t ha(-1)season(-1).

Therefore, further research needs to be undertaken to increase surface liming efficiency, improve soil quality, and promote crop development. The low solubility of lime has hampered acidity correction in deeper layers, particularly if a no-tillage system is used. However, surface liming efficiency can be improved if efficient crop rotation programs are implemented. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to investigate the long-term effects of lime doses on soil fertility and the cascading effects of these changes in soybean nutrition and productivity after maize monocrop or intercropped with palisade grass during three growing seasons. In a long-term experiment (started in 2019), soybean was cultivated under four lime doses (0, 2000, 4000, and 6000 kg ha(-1)) applied to soil surface in two crop systems (after maize monocrop or intercropped maize with palisade grass) during three consecutive agricultural years (2016-2019). Liming reduced soil acidic parameters and increased P, Ca2+, Mg2+, and S-SO(4)(2-)availability down the soil profile, which improved soybean nutrition and grain yield, particularly when it followed intercropped maize. Intercropping exploits species complementarities, which results in increasing the effectiveness of surface liming under no-tillage systems, contributing to higher soybean yields in crop rotation.

Therefore, a field experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of titanium (Ti) foliar application on soybean under a maize-soybean relay strip intercropping system. In this study, the soybean plants were sprayed with Ti treatments (T0S = 0, T1S = 125, T2S = 250, T3S = 500 and T4S = 1000 mg L-1) under maizesoybean relay strip intercropping. The results have indicated that under intercropping environment, Ti application significantly affected the growth of the plants. The soybean plants supplied with Ti treatment (T1S) significantly improved soybean diameter and stem strength at both V5 and R5 stages. Ti application resulted in a significant increase in SPAD values in T1S (i.e. 31.69 % and 21.21 %) and T2S (i.e. 21.55 % and 22.19 %) in comparison to control at both V5 and R5 stage, respectively. Furthermore, foliar application of Ti (T1S) significantly increased photosynthetic rate by 33.15 % and 22.80 % at both V5 and R5 stages. The stomatal conductance (Gs) increased significantly in T1S (44.39 %) and T2S (31.30 %) at the V5 stage and in T1S (29.85 %) at the R5 stage, respectively in comparison to control leading to increase root and shoot biomass in both V5 and R5 stages except for treatment T4S. Analysis of stem anatomical structure, stem strength (lodging resistance), and phosphorus content revealed that foliar application of Ti not only improved the shade tolerance but also increased yield (16-17 %) of soybean under maize-soybean relay strip intercropping. Conclusively, foliar application of Ti could be helpful in mitigating the shade stress and increasing soybean yield under the strip intercropping system.

Yield and biomass	PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA			English	Article						"Gossypium hirsutum; Vigna unguiculata; Zea mays; crop growth rate"	"SYSTEMS; COWPEA"	Field experiments were conducted in 1990 and 1991 in Tucson, Arizona, to examine the effects of spatial arrangement and density on yield and biomass of an annual cotton/cowpea/maize intercrop. In the 1990 experiment, treatments were combined in an unconfounded 4 x 4 factorial, which consisted of four spatial arrangements of cotton, cowpea, and maize crossed with four cowpea/maize densities. In the 1991 experiment, treatments were combined in an unconfounded 5 x 2 + 1 factorial, which consisted of five densities of cotton crossed with two densities of cowpea and maize, plus one additional treatment. The results of these experiments indicate that component-crop yield and biomass in an annual cotton/cowpea/maize intercrop can be significantly affected by the manipulation of spatial arrangement and density as management factors. The most appropriate arrangements and densities in particular circumstances depend on either the combined intercrop yield and biomass or the yield and biomass of a specific component crop that is more highly valued.

Our researches are to understand the reasons through non-hydraulic root signals (nHRS), yield and the relationships among them. Pot experiments were conducted with two soybean cultivars, under shade of maize (LI) and normal irradiance (HI). nHRS were traced during manipulative progressive soil drying period at branching stage under good soil conditions (HW), water stress treatment (LW), in 2010. Well-watered (WW), light drought (LD), moderate drought (MD) and severe drought (SD) were applied in 2009. In response to soil drying, nHRS appeared earlier in Gongxuan No. 1 (GX) than Gongqiudou 05-8 (GQ) under two irradiance treatments, but it disappeared earlier for GX than GQ under normal irradiance. GX exhibited a wider average soil water content threshold range (TR) of nHRS under low irradiance. Drought stress significantly decreased the shoot dry mass, root mass and grain yield (P< 0.05), excluding LD and nHRS treatments. Water use efficiency was significantly higher (P< 0.05) in GX than GQ under drought conditions in both irradiances. In a conclusion, soybean cultivar GX has wider TR in low irradiance condition, light drought had no significant effect on yield, nHRS maybe beneficial to maintain soybean yield under drought condition."

However, the crop is sensitive to weather conditions, and this causes large variations in yield between crop seasons. Suboptimal irrigation can be used to secure reasonable yields with increased water productivity. For maize grown offseason in the Cerrado biome of Brazil, there is little knowledge about the benefits of suboptimal irrigation. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of different irrigation amounts and two Brachiaria cultivars intercropped with maize on maize grain yield, biomass production for silage and water productivity in the second crop season. The study was conducted at Embrapa Milho e Sorgo Experimental Station, Sete Lagoas, MG, Brazil, in 2018 and 2019. Six irrigation levels were obtained by using a line-source sprinkler irrigation system. The irrigation levels used ranged from 94% to 11% of the cumulative reference evapotranspiration (ET0) in 2018, and from 90% to 34% of ET0 in 2019. Suboptimal irrigation above a certain level did not cause a significant decrease in silage biomass (59% and 71% of the ET0, in 2018 and 2019, respectively) and grain productivity (48% and 60% of the ET0, in 2018 and 2019, respectively). Additionally, there was an increase in crop water productivity and irrigation water productivity, for biomass of both silage and grains. The results demonstrate the potential of suboptimal irrigation as a strategy to reduce water resource usage while maintaining acceptable productivity levels.

Intensive land use with inappropriate land management is directly degrading South Asian uplands. A field trial was carried out on the uplands of Western Thailand with a 25% slope to examine the effect of land use management on soil loss for sustainable crop production during two consecutive years (2010-2011). Various cropping systems with soil conservation practices were compared to maize sole cropping (MSC). Results revealed that soil loss was at a minimum in the intercropping system of maize-chili-hedgerows with minimum tillage and fertilization that was 50% to 61% and 60% to 81% less than MSC and the bare soil plot during both years, respectively. Yield advantage was at its maximum, as indicated by the highest land equivalent ratios of 1.28 and 1.21 during 2010 and 2011, respectively, in maize-chili-hedgerows-intercropping with minimum tillage and fertilization. The highest economic returns (5925 and 1058 euros ha(-1) during 2010 and 2011, respectively) were also obtained from maize-chili-hedgerows-intercropping with minimum tillage and fertilization. Chili fresh fruit yield was maximum in the chili alone plot during both years due to the greater area under cultivation compared with intercropping. Maize-chili-hedgerows with minimum tillage and fertilization reduced soil loss and increased land productivity and net returns, indicating its promising features for sustainable crop production on uplands.

Maize-grain legume intercropping for enhanced resource use efficiency and crop productivity in the Guinea savanna of northern Ghana	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Soil fertility; Spatial arrangement; Radiation interception; LER; Net benefit"	"PHOTOSYNTHETICALLY ACTIVE RADIATION; DRY-MATTER; NITROGEN; FARMERS; YIELDS; ROTATION; SYSTEMS; COWPEA; INTERCEPTION; FERTILIZER"	Smallholder farmers in the Guinea savanna practise cereal-legume intercropping to mitigate risks of crop failure in mono-cropping. The productivity of cereal-legume intercrops could be influenced by the spatial arrangement of the intercrops and the soil fertility status. Knowledge on the effect of soil fertility status on intercrop productivity is generally lacking in the Guinea savanna despite the wide variability in soil fertility status in farmers' fields, and the productivity of within-row spatial arrangement of intercrops relative to the distinct-row systems under on-farm conditions has not been studied in the region. We studied effects of maize-legume spatial intercropping patterns and soil fertility status on resource use efficiency, crop productivity and economic profitability under on-farm conditions in the Guinea savanna. Treatments consisted of maize-legume intercropped within-row, 1 row of maize alternated with one row of legume, 2 rows of maize alternated with 2 rows of legume, a sole maize crop and a sole legume crop. These were assessed in the southern Guinea savanna (SGS) and the northern Guinea savanna (NGS) of northern Ghana for two seasons using three fields differing in soil fertility in each agro-ecological zone. Each treatment received 25 kg P and 30 kg K ha(-1) at sowing, while maize received 25 kg (intercrop) or 50 kg (sole) N ha(-1) at 3 and 6 weeks after sowing. The experiment was conducted in a randomised complete block design with each block of treatments replicated four times per fertility level at each site. Better soil conditions and rainfall in the SGS resulted in 48, 38 and 9% more maize, soybean and groundnut grain yield, respectively produced than in the NGS, while 11% more cowpea grain yield was produced in the NGS. Sole crops of maize and legumes produced significantly more grain yield per unit area than the respective intercrops of maize and legumes. Land equivalent ratios (LERs) of all intercrop patterns were greater than unity indicating more efficient and productive use of environmental resources by intercrops. Sole legumes intercepted more radiation than sole maize, while the interception by intercrops was in between that of sole legumes and sole maize. The intercrop however converted the intercepted radiation more efficiently into grain yield than the sole crops. Economic returns were greater for intercrops than for either sole crop. The within-row intercrop pattern was the most productive and lucrative system. Larger grain yields in the SGS and in fertile fields led to greater economic returns. However, intercropping systems in poorly fertile fields and in the NGS recorded greater LEES (1.16-1.81) compared with fertile fields (1.07-1.54) and with the SGS. This suggests that intercropping is more beneficial in less fertile fields and in more marginal environments such as the NGS. Cowpea and groundnut performed better than soybean when intercropped with maize, though the larger absolute grain yields of soybean resulted in larger net benefits.

Wilczek) - common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) sequential intercropping was studied to evaluate the patterns of radiation capture and radiation use efficiency and to determine the effects of leaf removal and row orientation on performance and intercropping efficiency. Sequential intercropping captured 1039 MJ m(-2) photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) accounting for 70% of incident seasonal PAR. The corresponding sole stands for maize captured 41%, mungbean 29%, common bean 34% and mungbean-common bean 63%. Intercropped components had interception ratios of 0.98, 0.31 and 0.61 for maize, mungbean and common bean, respectively. Associated maize used intercepted light with similar efficiency, mungbean with greater efficiency and common bean with lesser efficiency compared to sole crops. Maize leaf removal and row orientation had no significant effect on performance and partial land equivalent ratio (LER) of maize. Leaf removal under East-West (EW) orientation increased grain yield by 96%, total biomass by 63%, partial LER by 92%, in common bean and total LER by 7%. Leaf removal also improved grain yield, biomass yield, partial LER, in common bean and total LER during the wetter year of 2013. Similarly, EW orientation was advantageous in 2013 raising total LER by 8%. Maize leaf removal and EW row orientation had synergistic effects on intercropping efficiency and economic benefit and both have exerted positive influence under favourable weather. Total LER values of 1.47 in 2013 and 1.29 in 2015 had revealed greater biological efficiency for intercropping during both years though it was more profitable in 2013. Thus, the cropping system can be adopted under timely onset of the rainy season using EW row orientation while leaf removal can also be practiced depending on weather conditions and convenience.

J	"Park, SE; Benjamin, LR; Watkinson, AR"				"Park, SE; Benjamin, LR; Watkinson, AR"			Comparing biological productivity in cropping systems: a competition approach	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						"additive series; competition indices; intercropping; LER; methodology; regression model; response surface"	"WHEAT TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; PLANT COMPETITION; MIXED POPULATIONS; ADDITIVE DESIGNS; APPLIED NITROGEN; DAUCUS-CAROTA; REPLACEMENT; MIXTURES; YIELD; MAIZE"	1. Intercropping, the practice of growing two or more crops in close association, is attracting increasing interest in developed countries, primarily due to claims that it can provide increased yields in an environmentally sustainable manner. 2. The land equivalent ratio (LER) is frequently used to attest the claim that intercropping produces a greater total biological productivity per unit area of land than monocropping. However, similar to other indices, the value of the LER is dependent on the relative densities of the two crops and fails to provide an indication of the optimal crop density combination required to produce maximum biological productivity. We used an alternative methodology to predict the optimum density for planting two crops in a mixed stand. 3. Maize and beans were grown both in monoculture and in intercropped stands at a range of densities. Monocrop stands of both maize and bean displayed an asymptotic yield-density relationship. When a second crop was introduced into the stand there was no effect on the yield of maize, but there was a large reduction in the yield of bean. 4. The LER did not demonstrate an unequivocal advantage to intercropping. Less than a third of the LER values, over the range of densities considered, were greater than one, although none was significantly different to unity. The highest values were obtained from those plots sown with a high density of maize. 5. An alternative method of analysing the biological productivity of an intercrop System is proposed. This approach requires a combination of (i) an additive experimental design, (ii) the use of a regression model to measure the competitive effect of two species, and (iii) the presentation of the net competitive effect on individual and total yields using a response surface. The reciprocal model was used to dissociate and quantify intra- and interspecific competition, estimate a competitive equivalence coefficient and predict the individual yields of the full complement of density combinations included in the maize and bean experiment. 6. The model explained up to 90% of the variation in the observed yields of maize and bean in an intercrop. An inspection of the response surface for the LER indicated that the minimum density combination required to produce the maximum yield advantage within the density range considered comprised maize being planted at a density of 11 plants m(-2) and bean being planted at a density of 39 plants m(-2). Although this combination would provide the maximum biological productivity, it is considered unlikely to provide the maximum gross economic margin. 7. The above methodology may provide a useful tool for managing competition, either between two or more crops in an intercrop, or within a crop-weed interaction.

Walp) in intercropping and sole cropping systems under the climatic conditions of the Brazilian semiarid. The experiment was conducted in the city of Petrolina, PE. Shoots total dry mass and photosynthetically active radiation intercepted for both crops were monitored. Furthermore, it was obtained the evapotranspiration (ETc) by the soil water balance method. With these data and reference evapotranspiration it was obtained crop coefficient (Kc), which were subsequently used to adjust models as a function of accumulated degree days. With the results, it was found the water requirements from maize and cowpea intercropped system were greater than the sole system. Kc in the intercropped system was 0.90, 1.30, 1.20 and 0.72 for maize and 0.86, 1.30, 1.21 and 0.91 for cowpea, respectively, for the vegetative, flowering, grain filling and ripening stages. In the sole system, these values were, 0.86, 1.23, 0.97 and 0.52 for maize and 0.68, 1.02, 1.06 and 0.63 for cowpea in those phases mentioned. The variations of the Kc values for both systems and cultures have been associated to the increase of biomass and light interception. The Gaussian model adjusted properly described the relationship between Kc and accumulated degree days.

Weed Dynamics during Transition to Conservation Agriculture in Western Kenya Maize Production	PLOS ONE			English	Article							"SMALLHOLDER FARMERS; TILLAGE; YIELD; MANAGEMENT; ADOPTION; ECOLOGY; GROWTH; CROP"	Weed competition is a significant problem in maize (Zea mays, L.) production in Sub-Saharan Africa. Better understanding of weed management and costs in maize inter-cropped with beans (Phaseolus vulgaris, L.) during transition to conservation agricultural systems is needed. Changes in weed population and maize growth were assessed for a period of three years at Bungoma where crops are grown twice per year and at Trans-Nzoia where crops are grown once per year. Treatments included three tillage practices: minimum (MT), no-till (NT) and conventional (CT) applied to three cropping systems: continuous maize/bean intercropping (TYPICAL), maize/bean intercropping with relayed mucuna after bean harvest (RELAY) and maize, bean and mucuna planted in a strip intercropping arrangement (STRIP). Herbicides were used in NT, shallow hand hoeing and herbicides were used in MT and deep hoeing with no herbicides were used in CT. Weed and maize performance in the maize phase of each cropping system were assessed at both locations and costs of weed control were estimated at Manor House only. Weed density of grass and forb species declined significantly under MT and NT at Manor House and of grass species only at Mabanga. The greatest declines of more than 50% were observed as early as within one year of the transition to MT and NT in STRIP and TYPICAL cropping systems at Manor House. Transitioning to conservation based systems resulted in a decline of four out of five most dominant weed species. At the same time, no negative impact of MT or NT on maize growth was observed. Corresponding costs of weed management were reduced by $148.40 ha(-1) in MT and $149.60 ha(-1) in NT compared with CT. In conclusion, farmers can benefit from effective and less expensive weed management alternatives early in the process of transitioning to reduced tillage operations.

This is even more relevant in organic production systems, due to their limited use of chemical fertilizers and herbicides. As such, the aim of this study was to quantify biomass production, model the decomposition and N, P and K release of the mulch of different cover crops, and assess the weed suppression of cover crops in the form of mulch and in consortium with organic maize. A randomized block design was used, with a 7x2 factorial scheme (7 cover crop management strategies and 2 cropping systems - maize in monoculture and intercropped with jack bean) and 4 replicates. The management practices that produced the most biomass were white lupine intercropped with black oat and the white lupine, black oat and sunflower monocultures. The use of cover crops did not differ from manual weeding in terms of weed biomass, but did affect the relative importance (RI) of nutgrass. Additionally, maize intercropped with jack bean reduced weed biomass in subsequent crop growth stages.

Visual samplings in prefixed furrows were carried out by random observation of 60 plants of each crop for each area with a fortnightly frequency. In the case of the vignas, 30 days after sowing, 9 samples of 20 catches were taken using an entomological net. There was a greater insect-pest incidence in the leucaena intercropped with vigna with severe damage to this seasonal species. However, leucaena was not largely affected in this study. The bioregulators showed a similar performance in both areas. Heteropsylla cubans was the predominating insect in leucaena with populations of 5 individuals/m(2). In maize it was Spodoptera frugiperda with 1.2 larvae/m(2) and in vignas, homopterous of the Empoasca genus with 23 insects/m(2) and diverse Chrisomelidae that caused defoliation to the crop. It is concluded that leucaena during its establishment does not suffer physiological or plant health disorders when seasonal crops such as maize or vignas are intercropped. Maize intercropping is premisory. However, it does not seem advisable to intercrop vignas in view of phytophagous damage, which must be periodically studied.

The system however, has some advestages (e. g. better utilization ability for light, water and nutrients supply, better quality) over that of growing in pure stand. The maize-sorghum intercropping for fermentable forage exhibits also these adventages. The system is widely used in both America and Europe, but its' benefits are strongly modified by environment. Since no scientific paper has published on maize-sorghum intercropping in Carpathian Basin, a 3-yr research program was conducted in Hungary involving field trials, analyses for both chemical components and in situ digestibility tests. We have also tried to elucidate the following questions: (a.) Which is the most suitable ripening stage for forage? (b.) Wich Sorghum the headless or normal is most suited for intercropping? (c.) What maize-sorghum ratio is the best for fermentable forage? The headless/forage sorghum suits most for maize-sorghum intercropping: its yield and feeding value equals those of normal, and has a longer harvest period as well. Regarding quantitative and qualitative features, and the complex values, as digestible dry matter yield, or digestible protein yield, the best maize-sorghum ratios for intercropping am 50:50 of 60:40. Presented results are useful for preparing an efficient maize-sorghum intercropping system in Carpathian Basin.

The pure crop of maize gave significantly higher grain yield than maize + ginger intercrops. The pure crop of ginger also gave significantly higher rhizome yield over intercropping treatments. On equivalence basis the highest maize-equivalent yield was recorded in pure crop of ginger (340.85, 244.15 and 88.42 q/ha), followed by maize + ginger 1:2 (187.94, 151.71 and 79.78 q/ha) and maize + ginger 1:1 (168.98, 155.59 and 75.99 q/ha) intercropping systems in 1990, 1991 and 1992 respectively. Application of 180, 120 and 80 kg N, P2O5 and K2O/ha gave significantly higher grain and stover yields of maize and rhizome yield of ginger than the control in all the 3 years.

A 2-year field trial was conducted in 2019 and 2020 to study the effects of different soybean sowing times (9 days before corn sowing (ST1), 0 days at corn sowing (ST2), and 9 days after corn sowing (ST3), respectively) and densities (120,000 plants ha(-1) (PD1), 150,000 plants ha(-1) (PD2), and 180,000 plants ha(-1) (PD3), respectively, and the planting density of corn was 60,000 plants ha(-1) constantly) on total yield and on mixed silage quality in corn-soybean strip intercropping system. The yield decreased with an increase in soybean planting density. Before ensiling, the total dry matter (DM) content increased with an increase in soybean planting density, while that of crude protein content decreased with sowing time. The interaction of planting density x sowing time was significant for neutral detergent fiber and water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content. After ensiling, the WSC content of PD2ST3 (4.90% DM) was the highest. The PD1 (4.51%) had a higher content of ammonia-nitrogen to total nitrogen than that of PD2 and PD3. The lactic acid content of PD2ST3 (3.14% DM) was the highest. In general, better silage quality and a higher total yield were obtained when soybean was sown at the planting density of 150,000 plants ha(-1) after 9 days of corn sowing.

Experiments were conducted for two crop seasons in a randomized block design, in a split-plot scheme, with four repetitions. We evaluated three cropping systems containing maize andU. ruziziensissolely and intercropped (summer crop) in succession with irrigated common beans (winter-spring crop), managed with nitrogen topdressing combinations with 90 kg N ha(-1)by urea. Cropping systems with maize andU. ruziziensissolely or intercropped promoted sufficient straw production under the no-tillage system.Urochloa ruziziensissolely or intercropped with maize achieved full soil surface coverage and higher straw yield (8.3 to 9.5 t ha(-1)) compared to sole maize (7.1 to 7.8 t ha(-1)), thus favoring the implementation and maintenance of the no-tillage system. The quality of straw produced in crop succession systems was improved by nitrogen fertilizer applied to the previous common bean crop, which changed their nutrient content and nitrogen accumulation.

One of the ways to achieve this is by adopting low-cost solutions such as soil carbon enhancing practices (SCEPs). Given the complexity of adoption decisions, technologies are either adopted as substitutes or complements. A structured survey was utilized to collect data from 334 households in Western Kenya to estimate the impact of adopting SCEPs in combination and identify challenges hindering the adoption of the technologies. Two models, namely a multinomial endogenous treatment effect model and a multi-valued treatment effect model under conditional independence, were utilized to assess the impact of adoption on maize yield. Key variables established to influence adoption were literacy level, tenure security, and market participation. It was further revealed that adopting farmyard manure, intercropping, and a combination of intercropping and farmyard manure had a significant and positive impact on maize yield. This creates a need to promote the adoption of low-cost SCEPs to increase productivity and food security.

Role of crop competition in managing weeds in rice, wheat, and maize in India: A review	CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						"Crop competition; Spacing; Density; Direction of sowing; Weed competitive cultivars"	"CANARYGRASS PHALARIS-MINOR; DIRECT-SEEDED RICE; ZEA-MAYS; INTERCROPPING SYSTEM; PLANTING PATTERN; NUTRIENT-UPTAKE; SUPPRESS WEEDS; MANAGEMENT; PRODUCTIVITY; GROWTH"	In India, the three staple food crops viz., rice, wheat, and maize, contribute more than four-fifths of the total food grain production. Among the several factors limiting their productivity, weeds account for about 40%. In order to meet the requirements of growing population, it is essential to improve productivity by reducing such unwarranted losses. Managing weeds with crop competition is an eco-friendly approach. Once the mechanisms of competition are understood, further improvements in weed control could be gained by manipulating other agronomic practices. The choice of cultivars, crop density, seeding rate, direction of planting, and intercropping could be exploited to enhance crop competitiveness against weeds. The variation in competitiveness and weed suppression among cultivars has been documented in rice, and to a lesser extent in wheat and maize. Research has demonstrated that the integration of crop competitiveness with other methods, such as the use of herbicides and manual weeding, is successful in managing weeds. However, in India, greater efforts are needed to exploit crop competitiveness for managing weeds in rice, wheat and maize. The success of these approaches relies on proper understanding of the biology and ecology of weeds, to identify weak points in their life cycle. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, none was made on the maize-grass intercropping system in Brazil. The aim of this study was to determine the ET and CO2 fluxes in a signal grass pasture intercropped with maize, in Sao Joao, Pernambuco, Brazil, in a drought year. Furthermore, the soil water storage (SWS) and leaf area index (LAI) were determined. The latent heat flux was the main consumer of the available energy and the daily and seasonal ET and CO2 variations were mainly controlled by rainfall, through the changes in soil water content and consequently in SWS. The agroecosystem acted as an atmospheric carbon source, during drier periods and lower LAI, and as an atmospheric carbon sink, during wetter periods and higher LAI values. In a dry year, the intercropping sequestered 2.9 t C ha(-1), which was equivalent to 8.0 kg C ha(-1) d(-1). This study showed strong seasonal fluctuations in maize-grass intercropping CO2 fluxes, due to seasonality of rainfall, and that this agroecosystem is vulnerable to low SWS, with significant reduction in CO2 uptake during these periods.

Field data for 3 years at two sites/soil types in Denmark and three main factors: (i) cropping history (maize or grass-clover), (ii) maize monocrop or intercropped with red fescue (Festuca rubra L.) and (iii) three fertilizer N rates, were used to calibrate and validate the DAISY model for simulation of crop growth and soil N dynamics. Field and model results were used to study the treatment effects on the maize systems. Intercropped maize had 15-37 % lower N leaching than monocrop maize. Maize intercropping following a maize crop was achieved without yield loss at the standard N rate or higher, while red fescue offset N leaching. Maize intercropping following grass-clover needed less N, thereby greatly reducing the N leaching. The hypothesis that maize intercropping with fertilizer N rates applicable to monocrop maize decreases N leaching without significant yield loss was largely supported given the effect of cropping history and soil type. The applicability of DAISY was extended to provide better analyses of intercropping systems and complex management options to reduce N leaching across northern Europe.

For the subplots, we used four doses of lime (0, 2000, 4000, and 6000 kg ha(-1)) and four doses of gypsum (0, 1500, 3000, and 4500 kg ha(-1)) distributed at random in the sub-subplots. The combination of intermediate doses of lime and gypsum resulted in higher foliar Ca content. The grain yield increased with the combination of lime and gypsum. The maize when cultivated in intercropped system is more productive, with a point of maximum for dolomitic lime of 3031 kg ha(-1).	"[Bossolani, J. W.; Lazarini, E.; Santos, F. L.; Sanches, I.

The growth rate, forage yield, quality, interspecific competition and financial outcome of intercrops of red pea (Lathyrus cicera L.) with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and oat (Avena sativa L.) in two different seeding ratios (60:40, 80:20) were estimated. Growth rate of species was lower in the intercrops than in monocrops, especially in red pea-oat intercrops due to the strong competitive ability of oat. Red pea-oat intercrop of 60:40 produced the highest biomass (10.83Mg/ha) and crude protein yield (1,116kg/ha). Land equivalent ratio (LER) values were greater for the red pea with wheat (1.13) and oat 60:40 (1.09) indicating an advantage of intercropping in terms of dry-matter (DM) yield, while red pea:oat 60:40 ranked first for LER for nitrogen yield. Aggressivity and partial actual yield loss indicated cereals as the dominant species. The highest monetary advantage index was recorded for the red pea:wheat 60:40 and the highest intercropping advantage value was recorded for the red pea:oat 80:20. In conclusion, most intercrops of red pea with wheat and oat showed significant advantages relative to their monocrops due to better DM production, resource-use efficiency and economics under low-input farming.

The experimental design was a complete randomised block design with five replications and eight treatments, as follows: monocrop of cherry tomato adding residual maize crop residue (straw) as a mulch (control), monocrop of cherry tomato without the addition of maize crop residue (control), cherry tomatoes intercropped with jack bean, sun hemp, dwarf velvet bean, mung bean, white lupin or cowpea bean grown as green manures. In this production system, which was evaluated between 2011 and 2013, maize was cultivated from January to April, and the cherry tomatoes, with or without leguminous green manures, were grown from May/July to November/December. The number and weight of total and marketable fruits of tomatoes were 70% - 88% higher in 2011 than in 2012 and the number of damaged fruits was 12% lower in 2011 than in 2012. In 2011, the weights of total and marketable fruits in the intercropping treatment with white lupin were lower than that in the controls and in the intercropping treatments with dwarf velvet and cowpea bean. The white lupin and sun hemp green manures produced the highest biomass dry weight, followed by the jack bean, cowpea bean, mung bean and dwarf velvet bean. The different treatments had no effect on the yield of the maize.

Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the biomass production of and total nutrient inBrachiariaspp. andPanicum maximumforage grasses used as mulch and soybean yields in an integrated crop-livestock system and second-crop maize succession system. The treatments consisted of the following cropping systems: Xaraes palisadegrass intercropped with soybean, Congo grass intercropped with soybean, Mombaca guinea grass intercropped with soybean, Tamani guinea grass intercropped with soybean and a soybean/maize succession system. The forage grasses were established during the soybean R6-R7 stage. Compared with Congo grass, Xaraes palisadegrass, Mombaca guinea grass and Tamani guinea grass produced more biomass and equivalent amounts of fertilizer returned to the soil and resulted in greater nutrient cycling, indicating the benefits of these grasses for use as mulch in integrated production systems. Maize had a greater C/N ratio, but the forage grasses also exhibited high potential by protecting the soil until the end of the soybean development cycle. The use of an integrated crop-livestock system combined with a forage cropping system provided greater soil nutrient cycling than the maize cropping system did, which resulted in increased soybean yields, thus contributing to the sustainability of agricultural systems.

A split-plot design with three replicates was used. Results showed that maize hybrids had significant effect on yield and yield attributes of maize and cowpea in both seasons, with some exception. The S.C.168 hybrid gave the highest grain yield and its components, while intercropping cowpea with S.C.176 hybrid significantly increased yield and its attributes of cowpea in comparison with other hybrids. Applying 75% N mineral along with 25% N nano significantly increased growth, yield and yield components of maize and cowpea in both seasons. Significantly increase in yield and its attributes of maize and cowpea was realized by interaction between maize SC168 and 75% N mineral +25% N nano fertilization. Intercropping cowpea with maize SC168 that received 75% of the N mineral + 25% nano fertilizer recorded the highest LER 1.67 and 1.66, ATER 1.59 and 1.58, Aggressivity 0.28 and 0.23, gross return15865 and 15854 L.E./fed and net return 7983 and 7972L.E./fed in first and second seasons, respectively, as well as rationalizing the use of N mineral fertilizers.

J	Glowacka, A				Glowacka, Aleksandra			THE INFLUENCE OF STRIP CROPPING AND ADJACENT PLANT SPECIES ON THE CONTENT AND UPTAKE OF N, P, K, Mg AND Ca BY MAIZE (ZEA MAYS L.)	ROMANIAN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						"Strip cropping; interspecific facilitation; macronutrients; weed control"	"PHOSPHORUS UPTAKE; LEGUMES; YIELD; WHEAT; LUPIN; CORN; RHIZOSPHERE; WHEAT/MAIZE; COMPETITION; CHICKPEA"	Strip cropping is a form of intercropping in which two or more crop species are grown in adjacent strips. Maize is often grown in strip cropping because it strongly reacts to the edge effect with increased yield. A field experiment was conducted in the years 2008-2010 at the Experimental Station in Zamosc, University of Life Sciences in Lublin (50 degrees 42'N, 23 degrees 16'E). Two cropping methods, sole cropping and strip cropping (narrow-leafed lupin, dent maize and spring oats in adjacent strips), and two weed control methods, mechanical and chemical, were compared. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of the cropping systems and weed control methods on content and uptake of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and calcium by maize. The impact of the position of the row in strip cropping and of the adjacent plant species on changes in nutrient content and uptake was also studied. Strip cropping significantly increased potassium and calcium content in the maize, but decreased the content of nitrogen, phosphorus and magnesium. In strip cropping, proximity to oats contributed to higher potassium content in the maize, while placement next to lupin led to greater accumulation of phosphorus and calcium: Uptake of nitrogen, phosphorus, magnesium and calcium by the maize was higher in the border rows next to lupin. The results indicate that selection of different species for strip cropping can affect the chemical composition of the plant. This can be a cost-effective way to mitigate mineral shortages in crops.

Diversifying maize monocrop with legumes has been proposed as one solution to declining soil fertility. Adoption of legumes in Africa remains low despite the much needed soil fertility and nutrition benefits provided by the crops. We employ choice experiments to examine farmers' preferences for groundnut, soybean, and pigeon pea inter cropped with maize and explore barriers and drivers to adoption in Central and Southern Malawi. Overall, farmers significantly discount legume yields in favor of maize yields despite the additional benefits provided by legumes. Labor constraints and market access are potentially more important barriers to legume adoption than previously thought. Results identified three types of farmers with varying preferences for grain yields, the largest group (48%) associated with strongly positive preference for both legume and maize grain yield, a medium-sized group (35%) that values only maize yield, and the smallest group (17%) having preferences only for legume yield. The medium group may be growing legumes for other benefits such as enhanced maize productivity, and the smallest group may be primarily subsistence producers. These findings suggest that uptake of legume maize intercrop systems might be improved if practitioners focus on legumes that have lower labor requirements and better marketability.

Azospirillum has a proven role in benefiting the maize (Zea mays) crop in terms of nutrient (nitrogen) supply as well as plant growth enhancement. Bihar state has highest average national maize productivity although fertilizer consumption is minimum, indicating richness of Azospirillum both in terms of population and diversity in soils. An experiment was planned to generate basic information on Azospirillum population variation in maize soils under different agricultural practices and soil types of Bihar, to identify suitable agricultural practices supporting the target microorganism and efficient Azospirillum strain(s). No tillage, growing traditional maize cultivar, land use history (diara soil having history of maize cultivation), soil organic carbon (>1%) and intercrop with oat supported prevalence of Azospirillum in maize rhizosphere. Native Azospirillum population varied from 1 million to 1 billion/g soil under diverse agricultural practices and soil types. Such richness, however, does not necessarily mean that artificial inoculation of Azospirillum is not required in Bihar soils as 92% of Azospirillum isolates (50 isolates) were poor in nitrogen-fixing ability and 88% were poor on IAA production. Efficient strains of Azospirillum based on growth (three), acetylene reduction assay (three), IAA production (three), broad range of pH (two) and temperature tolerance were identified. The findings suggested that maize crop in Bihar should be inoculated in universal mode rather than site-specific mode.	"[Verma, Rinkee; Chourasia, S. K.; Jha, M.

Leaf area values of beans were Inore sensitive to the same treatments. Microenvironmental conditions in maize-bean mixtures were Inore favourable for bean crop than for sole brans. An intercropping system had a greater influence on yield components of maize. Component combination 1/2:1/2 (maize:bean) was most effective in all yield components of maize. Intraspecific competition appears to be more intense than interspecific competition in both crops. Yield component of bean was more sensitive to water regime of the site than to planting pattern in an intercrop. Irrigation increased all yield components of bean (especially pod number). The intercropping system decreased harvest index in both crops compared with monocrops. Maximum total grain yield was in 1994 in irrigated maize-bean intercrop 1/2:1/2, with highest efficiency being in an intercrop in irrigation in 1995. The Land Equivalent Ratio (LER), based on grain yield, was consistently greater than 1.0 in an irrigation water regime in 1995. Proportion of maize:bean = 1/2:1/2 gave the highest increase of yield (LER = 1.54). Under conditions of chernozem soil type in Zemun Polje, with often-expressed dry periods, irrigation is a very important measure for increasing maize-beans intercrop productivity.

Millsp.]. Intercropping reduced the yield of maize by 7.9% and of pigeonpea by 63.8% compared with the respective pure stands. Association of both component species at recommended level of nutrients (100%) resulted in maximum land-equivalent ratio (1.35) together with grain yield (4.11 tonnes/ha), and gave maximum monetary advantage (Rs 2 728/ha) and net return (Rs 5 972/ha), ie 18.1% more net return than sole maize and 104.1% than sole pigeonpea. The relative net return from this association compared with sole maize and sole pigeonpea grown at 100% recommended dose was Rs 1.10 and Rs 1.59 respectively. The same treatment also indicated a modest competitive ratio (2.1:1) and aggressivity factor (+/- 0.490) and gave a good value for the product of crowding coefficient (K = 8.98).

Plants of each test genotype were sown in pots and heavily infested with S. hermonthica. Emergence count of the parasite, test crop damage rating (1-9), and test crop plant height were measured at 9 weeks after planting. The effects of genotypes, samples and their interaction for all three traits measured were highly significant (p = 0.001). Of the 12 samples of S. hermonthica, all have high emergence on both maize and sorghum. Seven samples gave low emergence on millet genotypes and two none at all. Three of the four samples from millet sources gave higher parasite emergence on sorghum and maize than on millet. For Striga damage rating, millet had the lowest average scores, followed by maize and sorghum. The responses of maize genotypes to samples from millet and sorghum sources were significantly different. Millet genotypes also had different responses to the samples from millet sources. For plant height differences, samples from sorghum sources interacted significantly with test maize genotypes, and millet samples with sorghum genotypes. The results indicate that both intercrop and intracrop strains of S. hermonthica are present in Nigeria.

J	Andert, S				Andert, Sabine			The Method and Timing of Weed Control Affect the Productivity of Intercropped Maize (Zea mays L.) and Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)	AGRICULTURE-BASEL			English	Article						"intercropping; chemical herbicide use; mechanical weed control; pre/post-emergence herbicide application"	"PHOSPHORUS AVAILABILITY; SPECIES COMPOSITION; BIOGAS PRODUCTION; GRAIN-YIELD; SOIL; COMPETITION; HERBICIDES; DIVERSITY; EFFICACY; INCREASE"	Intercropping results in high overall system productivity on a given piece of land due to the efficient use of available plant growth resources. Weed control in intercropping systems is, however, still a challenge. This study focuses on the effect of the type of weed control (chemical/mechanical) and the timing of chemical herbicide application (pre-emergence/post-emergence) on weed control and crop productivity in a maize bean mixture. For this purpose, the results of a three-year field experiment (2017 to 2019) in northeast Germany will be presented. The experimental setup included a control, three chemical methods, and one mechanical method of weed control. Except for the mechanical treatment, a completely randomized block design was established. Weeds were assessed at BBCH 12 of the maize, immediately before the first weed control treatments to estimate the initial weed infestation, and twice in the six to eight leaf stage of the maize. The weed coverage (%) was estimated. The maize bean mixture was harvested and yields (t ha(-1)) were measured. The results confirm that the type of weed control, as well as the timing of herbicide application, significantly affects the weed coverage of the maize bean mixture. The most successful weed control strategy was the double chemical herbicide application, in which chemical herbicides are in used pre-emergence beans (BBCH 12 maize) and post-emergence beans (BBCH 12 bean). Weed coverage was reduced by up to 75% using this most effective herbicide strategy and by up to 61% through mechanical weed control, compared to the control. The additional effects of post-emergence treatment on the pre-emergence herbicide control resulted in a 16.5% weed coverage decline. The yield surplus of double chemical herbicide application (pre/post-emergence) was up to 53%, and for the mechanical weed control up to 23%. Additionally, post-emergence herbicide use in intercropped maize and bean resulted in a 16% yield surplus, compared to the single pre-emergence chemical weed control. Optimal timing of weed control during the most sensitive phenology stages of the maize bean mixture is crucial for productivity. The results of this study provide an additional option for suitable weed control of intercropped maize and bean.

Although mathematical modelling has contributed some useful insights, there has been a tendency to concentrate on certain aspects, such as defining threshold levels and weed-crop competition, to the exclusion of other critical areas. In particular, weed dispersion, variation in recruitment and mortality, spatial heterogeneity in weed populations and the existence of multispecies assemblages have received scant attention. The future of weed modelling would seem to lie in trying to marry these various aspects to create models more firmly anchored on physiological principles and biological variation.

Among management systems intercropping is highly used, especially for medium and small farmers. It is a system where two or more crops with different architectures and vegetative cycles are explored simultaneously at the same location. This research investigated the effects of maize intercropped with jack bean on soil losses due to water erosion, estimate C factor of Universal Soil Losses Equation (USLE) and how it can be affected by soil coverage. The results obtained also contribute to database generation, important to model and estimate soil erosion. Total soil loss by erosion caused by natural rain, at Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil, were: 4.20, 1.86, 1.38 and 1.14 Mg ha(-1), respectively, for bare soil, maize, jack bean and the intercropping of both species, during evaluated period. Values of C factor of USLE were: 0.039, 0.054 and 0.077 Mg ha Mg-1 ha(-1) for maize, jack bean and intercropping between both crops, respectively. Maize presented lower vegetation cover index, followed by jack beans and consortium of the studied species. Intercropping between species showed greater potential on soil erosion control, since its cultivation resulted in lower soil losses than single crops cultivation, and this aspect is really important for small and medium farmers in the studied region.

In this experiment, the performances of monoculture-organic (MO), strip intercropping-organic (10), monoculture-conventional (MC), and strip intercropping-conventional (IC) farming systems were compared with respect to yield quantity and quality properties of sweet maize, and local cowpea and okra varieties for 2 years. The land equivalent ratios (LERs) calculated based on mean maximum and minimum yields of cowpeas and okras ranged between 0.94 and 1.25 for strip intercropping with sweet maize. There appeared to be no difference in mean yields of maize, cowpeas, and okras between the 10 and IC systems and in mean maize yields between the MO and MC systems (P > 0.05). The LER value (0.99) of the 10 farming system was higher than that (0.95) of IC farming system. The LER values close to one indicated that there were no significant differences in yield quantity and quality of the crops among the four farming systems. The findings revealed that strip intercropping alone or in combination with organic cropping may be equally profitable to monoculture and favored for sustainable farming if agricultural production costs including environmental externalities, such as environmental degradation and destruction were accounted for.

The experiment was carried out at Petrolina, State of Pernambuco. The crops, in different planting systems (single and intercropping), underwent the five blades of irrigation, applied at the flowering stage of cowpea to 40 days after sowing. Combining the settings of cultivation system and the different depths of irrigation, crops of maize and cowpea were subjected to 15 different treatments. To evaluate the performance of crops in the different treatments indicators that consider the production response of crops and the performance of the application of water in the production system were used. The grain yield responses of maize and cowpea to the soil water content were reduced in intercropped plantations, in relation to single cropping. Even so, in economic terms, the adoption of maize-cowpea proved to be more advantageous in all treatments.

LEGUME-MAIZE ROTATION OR RELAY? OPTIONS FOR ECOLOGICAL INTENSIFICATION OF SMALLHOLDER FARMS IN THE GUINEA SAVANNA OF NORTHERN GHANA	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article							"GRAIN LEGUMES; SUSTAINABLE INTENSIFICATION; NITROGEN; PRODUCTIVITY; SYSTEMS; AFRICA; FALLOW"	"Soil nutrient constraints coupled with erratic rainfall have led to poor crop yields and occasionally to crop failure in sole cropping in the Guinea savanna of West Africa. We explored different maize-grain legume diversification and intensification options that can contribute to mitigating risks of crop failure, increase crop productivity under different soil fertility levels, while improving soil fertility due to biological N-2-fixation by the legume. There were four relay patterns with cowpea sown first and maize sown at least 2 weeks after sowing (WAS) cowpea; two relay patterns with maize sown first and cowpea sown at least 3 WAS maize in different spatial arrangements. These were compared with groundnut-maize, soybean- maize, fallow-maize and continuous maize rotations in fields high, medium and poor in fertility at a site each in the southern (SGS) and northern (NGS) Guinea savanna of northern Ghana. Legumes grown in the poorly fertile fields relied more on N-2-fixation for growth leading to generally larger net N inputs to the soil. Crop yields declined with decreasing soil fertility and were larger in the SGS than in the NGS due to more favourable rainfall and soil fertility. Spatial arrangements of relay intercrops did not have any significant impact on maize and legume grain yields. Sowing maize first followed by a cowpea relay resulted in 0.18-0.26 t ha(-1) reduction in cowpea grain yield relative to cowpea sown from the onset. Relaying maize into cowpea led to a 0.29-0.64 t ha(-1) reduction in maize grain yield relative to maize sown from the onset in the SGS. In the NGS, a decline of 0.66 and 0.82 t ha(-1) in maize grain yield relative to maize sown from the onset was observed due to less rainfall received by the relay maize. Groundnut and soybean induced 0.38-1.01 t ha(-1) more grain yield of a subsequent maize relative to continuous maize, and 1.17-1.71 t ha(-1) more yield relative to relay maize across both sites. Accumulated crop yields over both years suggest that sowing maize first followed by cowpea relay is a promising ecological intensification option besides the more common legume-maize rotation in the Guinea savanna, as it was comparable with soybean-maize rotation and more productive than the other treatments."

Nodulated and non-nodulating Phaseolus genotypes were included in separate treatments to help distinguish between benefits due to transfer of fixed N and competition for N in the growth medium. When intercropped with bean foliarly fed with ((NH4)-N-15)2SO4, maize was enriched with N-15, showing that N had been transferred. The amounts of N transferred were small, and always < 5% of the N in the N2-fixing beans. There was a decrease in shoot-N in maize intercropped with N2-fixing bean compared to maize intercropped with the non-nodulating beans. Non-nodulating bean transferred comparable amounts of N to intercropped maize plants although their total N content was less than a quarter of that in the N2-fixing beans. For the isotope dilution experiments, N-15-fertilizer was incorporated into a soil-based compost together with sucrose to stabilise the N-15-enrichment of available N. When plants grew vigorously no transfer of N from bean to maize was detected by isotope dilution, and again shoot N of maize intercropped with N2-fixing beans was less than that of maize with non-nodulating beans. In a further experiment, growth of maize and bean plants was reduced by severe insect attack and up to 15% (between 9 and 15 mg N pot-1) of the N in N2-fixing beans was estimated by isotope dilution to have been transferred. Small (5-10 mg N pot-1) but significant increases in total N yield were found in the maize intercropped with N2-fixing bean compared to maize intercropped with non-nodulating bean. In this experiment treatments with or without vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza were established but showed no significant differences in N-transfer from unioculated plants. As transfer of N from the beans to intercropped cereals showed such little benefit under conditions of severe N limitation, our results indicate that many careful field experiments are required before we can conclude that N-transfer from Phaseolus to intercropped cereals is significant in agriculture.

J	Olasantan, FO				Olasantan, FO			Nitrogen fertilization of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) in an intercropping system with cassava (Manihot esculenta) and maize (Zea mays) in south-western Nigeria	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article							MELON	Nitrogen fertilization of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) when intercropped with cassava (Manihot esculenta) and maize (Zea mays) was studied using three N rates (0, 60 and 120 kg/ha) in two field experiments in Nigeria between 1995 and 1997. The okra was grown between the cassava and maize rows. The effect of using two contrasting maize cvs. TZE Composite 3 Cl (less-tall, early-maturing with narrow leaves) and DMRSR-Y (tall, late-maturing with broad leaves) on N response of okra in the mixture was also investigated. Intercropping with maize or cassava and maize significantly increased stem elongation, delayed pod harvest, and decreased branch or pod formation and marketable pod yield in okra. In the cassava/maize/okra combination, maize had greater effect than cassava in determining most growth and pod yield attributes of the okra crop, regardless of N rate. However, the effect was relatively less severe in mixtures with early-maize cv. TZE Composite 3 Cl than with late-maize cv. DMRSR-Y. Although applied N at rates above 60 kg/ha in intercropping increased maize grain and cassava tuber yields, this did not result in a further significant gain in pod yield of the associated okra crop. The present recommendation of 60 kg/ha for N fertilization of cassava/maize intercrop was found to be applicable to okra grown between the cassava/maize rows using the less-tall, early-maize cultivar with relatively narrow leaves, and possibly reduced leaf area.

In order to know the effects of recovery growth of the late-planted soya bean in maize-soya bean relay intercropping, a field experiment was carried out to observe architectural, morphological, physiological and anatomical traits of soya bean plants related to shade and subsequent removal in intercropping before and after maize harvest, respectively. During shade period, soya bean biomass was severely reduced, and stem elongation was stimulated. Typical features of shade grown leaves were found, such as lower LMA (leaf mass per unit area), thinner thickness, higher chlorophyll content, lower chlorophyll a: b ratio. Whole-plant leaf area analysis found that soya bean increased leaf area ratio by adjusting leaf morphology rather than by dry mass allocation. After maize harvest, leaf area and leaf mass increased rapidly, contributing to compensation growth in intercropped soya bean. Meanwhile, physiological and anatomical traits of leaf went back to similar levels as grown in sole cropping. However, stem morphological traits were irreversible after removal of shade. Finally, no difference on seed weight per plant of soya bean was observed between relay intercropping and sole cropping. Based on these findings, we speculated the recovery growth might be the direct determining factor on pod formation in soya bean, and improvement on the capacity of recovery growth could increase yield of relay intercropped soya bean.

In addition to the straw production, the intercropping can supply nitrogen (N) to the common bean grown in succession, reducing the use of mineral fertilizer, which is pollutant and has a high cost. The present study aimed to evaluate the response to N fertilization of common bean in succession to maize cropping systems, as well as the viability of these systems in the no-tillage system. The experimental design was randomized blocks, in a split-plot arrangement, with four replicates. The plots consisted of the following systems: maize as a single crop, maize intercropped with brachiaria and maize intercropped with crotalaria. The subplots were five N doses (0 kg ha(-1), 50 kg ha(-1), 100 kg ha(-1), 150 kg ha(-1) and 200 kg ha(-1)), applied as topdressing fertilization in winter common bean, in succession to the maize cropping systems. For the maize cultivation systems, the grain yield and N amount and accumulation in the straw were evaluated. As for the common bean in succession, the grain yield and grain quality attributes were assessed. Although the three cropping systems were viable for maize grain yield, the intercropping of maize with crotalaria led to a higher N accumulation in the straw and a larger quantity of straw dry mass. The increase of the N doses promoted an increase in the grain yield of common bean grown in succession to intercropped maize. Maize intercropped with crotalaria resulted in grains with a higher size and, concerning the grain yield, an equivalent effect to that of a topdressing application of more than 200 kg ha(-1) of N was observed for the common bean in succession.

The push-pull system has often been assessed at plot level and as a package (e.g., Maize + Desmodium + Napier grass). However, it is unclear how the system performs in different landscape settings or when companion crops are changed to better meet household needs. Here we evaluate the potential of the push-pull system to suppress maize stemborer infestations in three landscapes in the Rift Valley region of Ethiopia along a gradient of landscape complexity. Within each landscape, experimental plots were established on four representative smallholder farms. At each farm we used a split-plot factorial design with main plots surrounded or not by Napier grass, and subplots consisting of sole maize, maize bean or maize-Desmodium. We assessed stemborer infestation level and maize grain and stover yields during two years, as well as natural enemies abundance and egg predation at two maize development stages in the second year. In the simple landscape, which was dominated by maize, all treatments had high stemborer infestation levels, irrespective of within-field crop diversity; the presence of Napier grass was associated with higher predator abundance, while egg predation rates were the highest in the maize-bean intercrop. In the intermediate complexity landscape, subplots with sole maize had higher stemborer infestation levels compared to maize-bean or maize-Desmodium. In the complex landscape, infestation levels were low in all treatments. However, none of these effects led to significant differences in maize grain and stover yields among treatments in any of the landscapes. The benefits of the push-pull system accrued from the companion crops (bean, Desmodium and Napier), rather than from stemborer suppression per se. Our findings highlight the importance of the surrounding landscape in mediating the performance of the push-pull system, provide new insights on the contribution of the different components of push-pull system and can guide the design of ecologically intensive agroecosystems."

Legumes have shown great potential to enhance system productivity. On-farm experiments were conducted in different agro-ecological zones (AEZ) in Western Kenya to assess the agronomic and economic benefits of promising legumes. In each zone, trials were established in fields of high, medium and low fertility to assess the effect of soil fertility heterogeneity on legume productivity and subsequent maize yield. Common bean, soybean, groundnut, lima bean, lablab, velvet bean, crotalaria, and jackbean were grown in the short rains season, followed by maize in the long rains season. Alongside, continuous maize treatments fertilised at different rates were established. AEZs and soil fertility gradients within these zones greatly affected crop productivity, returns to land and labour of rotations, as well as the relative performance of rotations. Poorer soil fertility and AEZs with lower rainfall gave smaller legume and maize yields and consequently, smaller returns to land and labour. The cultivation of legumes increased maize yields in the subsequent long rains season compared with continuous maize receiving fertiliser at a similar rate, while the increase of maize after green manure legumes was stronger than that after grain legumes. Maize yield responded strongly to increasing amounts of N applied as legume residues with diminishing returns to legume-N application rates above 100 kg N ha(-1). In the low potential zones, factors other than improved N availability likely also stimulated maize yield. Rotations with grain legumes generally provided better returns than those with green manures. Intercropping bean with maize in the long rains season provided an additional bean yield that did not come at the expense of maize yield and improved returns to land and labour, but more so in the high potential zones. The results demonstrate the strong impact of biophysical diversity on the productivity of the legumes and suggest the need for careful targeting of legume technologies to the different biophysical conditions.

However, there is little information on whether the choice of accession affects maize/roselle intercrops. Also, there is little information on whether intercropping roselle with maize is beneficial or detrimental to the yields of the crops. A field experiment was conducted for two seasons to assess the growth and yield performance of three roselle accessions as influenced by intercropping with maize and to assess whether maize growth and yield would be influenced upon intercropping with roselle. The roselle accessions were Bissap, Local, and Samadah. Intercropped roselle accessions, their soles, and sole maize were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Intercrop performance was determined using area x time equivalence ratio (ATER) and competitive ratio (CR). The results showed significant differences in roselle accessions for growth and yield performance. Local outperformed the other accessions in both growth and yield attributes. Roselle calyx and shoot yields were significantly higher in intercrops than in soles. Maize growth and yield were not significantly affected by intercropping with roselle, but maize yield attributes differed between seasons. The ATERs were 1.99, 2.18, and 2.49 for Samadah, Bissap, and Local, respectively, indicating that there was productive use of space and time for intercropping. The CR ranged from 1.03 to 1.17, 0.96 to 1.09, and 1.12 to 1.25 for stem diameter, number of leaves per plant, and plant height, respectively. The study showed that the choice of accession did not affect the intercrop performance. It also showed that intercropping roselle with maize is beneficial to roselle without compromising the yield of maize.

Maize (Zea mays L. M) was intercropped with soybean (Glycine max L. S) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. C) as binary mixtues (maize + legume), and the seed rates were as follows: 100 + 0%, 75 + 25%, 50 + 50% and 25 + 75%. The harvested plants were chopped with the particle size of < 2, ensiled in 2 kg plastic jars and left fermentation at 25 +/- 2 degrees C for 45 days. In this study, silage yield, dry matter ratio, pH value, crude protein ratio, acid detergent fiber, neutral detergent fiber, digestibility of dry matter, dry matter intake, total digestibil nutrient relative feed values, lactic acid, acetic acid, butyric acid, malic acid, citric acid, succinic acid, oxalic acid, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium contents were determined. All the M + S mixtures showed high performance in terms of Flieg score and lactic acid content. The highest relative feed quality value was determined in the sole cowpea (156.4) and 25M + 75S% (148.5) mixture. As a result, intercropping maize with legumes resulted in superior silage quality without a reduction in yield.

To investigate whether foliar spraying different types of plant growth regulators could improve the growth and yield of intercropped soybean. We conducted a sequential field experiment in 2018 and 2019, with foliar spraying of uniconazole (S3307), 6-benzyladenine (6-BA), diethyl aminoethyl hexanoate (DA-6) and water (CK) on soybean at the anthesis stage. Results showed the value of leaf area index, and chlorophyll (a + b) content, and net photosynthesis rat of soybean leaves were highest under DA-6 and significantly higher than CK at 56 day after spraying (DAS). Foliar spraying 6-BA, S3307 and DA-6 increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxide (POD), and catalase (CAT) of soybean leaves at 35 and 56 DAS. The soybean aboveground dry matter weight and the dry matter accumulation after flowering stage was highest under DA-6 treatment, and the dry matter transportation ratio and the proportion of dry matter in pods were highest under S3307 treatment. The value of maximum grain filling rate (V-max) and mean grain filling rate (V-mean) of soybean were highest in S3307, while the value of active grain filling period (D) was highest in DA-6. The hundred-grains weight was highest in S3307, then followed by DA-6 and S3307. The pods per plant in DA-6 were significantly higher than in 6-BA and S3307 and increased by 25.4% and 32.9% compared to CK in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Foliar spraying DA-6 (60 mg L-1) has a better effect on increasing the physiological function and photosynthetic capacity of leaves, leading to improving the grain filling process and increasing the yield of relay-intercropped soybean.

What is not known, however, is the extent to which the establishment and N contribution of mucuna in these areas depend on symbiotic properties such as effective nodulation and mycorrhizal infection. Short term surveys carried out in 34 farmer's arable fields located in four different sites in the derived savanna, southern Benin, West Africa, together with results of greenhouse and field experiments showed that mycorrhizal infection rate of mucuna ranged from 2 to 31% and correlated positively with nodulation and shoot dry matter production. Nodulation occurred in 79% of the fields with numbers of nodules ranging from 0 to 135 plant(-1). Mucuna responded both to inoculation and N fertilizer in degraded soils but growth response depended on the rhizobia strains and mucuna varieties. Mucuna accumulated in 12 weeks about 313 kg N ha(-1) as either a sole crop or 166 kg N ha(-1) when mixed/intercropped with maize, respectively. Across all cropping systems it derived an average of 70% of its N from atmospheric N-2 (estimates made by the N-15 isotope dilution method), representing 167 kg N ha(-1) per 12 weeks in the field. Mucuna interplanted with maize obtained a greater proportion of its nitrogen (74%) from fixation than did mucuna grown alone (66%) suggesting that competition for soil N influences the proportion of nitrogen fixed by mucuna. The total amount of N-2 fixed per hectare was, however, reduced significantly by intercropping mucuna with maize. A preceding mucuna crop provided a maize yield equivalent to 120 kg N kg ha(-1) of inorganic N fertilizer.

The aim of this study therefore, was to evaluate residual phosphate fertilisation and Azospirillum brasilense, together with the contribution of straw from maize intercropped with Marandu grass, on leaf nutritional content, yield components and winter bean yield. The experiment was carried out on the Teaching and Research Farm, of the School of Engineering at UNESP, located in Selviria in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, in a typic clayey dystrophic Red Latosol. The experimental design was of randomised blocks with four replications in a 5 x 2 factorial scheme. The treatments consisted of beans sown on straw from maize intercropped with Marandu grass on areas that had received five levels of P2O5 in the form of MAP, applied during an initial cultivation of black oats (0, 30, 60, 120 and 240 kg ha(-1)), both with and without inoculation of the oat and maize which preceded the beans with Azospirillum brasilense. Leaf nutrient content, leaf chlorophyll index (ICF), yield components and bean productivity were all evaluated. Inoculation with Azospirillum brasilense of the black oat and maize seeds improved the nutritional status of the plants, but had a negative effect on grain yield. Fertilisation of the oat crop with phosphorus had a positive residual effect on the beans, with increases in yield components and grain yield.

However, few studies have investigated whether intercropping systems can decrease soil CO2 emission. We thus carried out a field experiment to compare such emissions produced by monocultural maize (M) and maize-legume intercropping systems (maize intercropped with Alfalfa (MA), and maize intercropped with Sweet Clover (MSC)) in 2010. Results showed that mean seasonal fluxes of CO2 was greater for M than that for the intercropped plots. Cumulative CO2 flux for MA was significantly reduced by 14% compared to M (6.83 t ha(-1)) (P<0.05). There were no signicant correlations between daily CO2 emission and soil temperature or moisture during the observed period under dry environmental condition (P<0.05).

J	BOUDREAU, MA				BOUDREAU, MA			EFFECT OF INTERCROPPING BEANS WITH MAIZE ON THE SEVERITY OF ANGULAR LEAF-SPOT OF BEANS IN KENYA	PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article							"RESISTANCE; DISEASES; WHEAT"	Angular leaf spot severity was evaluated on Phaseolus beans which had been planted alone (monocrop) and also simultaneously with maize (intercrop) at Kabete, Kenya, in November 1986 (short rains), and at Kabete and Thika in April 1987 (long rains). Intercropping reduced the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) in the short rains at Kabete and at Thika in the long rains by 23-33% at bean:maize proportions of 2:1 for some leaf positions, but did not reduce AUDPC significantly at Kabete in the long rains. Additional treatments to evaluate bean density and planting pattern (row against random) conducted in the short rains had no effect on AUDPC, although disease was reduced by 12-17% at higher bean densities when maize was not present. Fertilization increased AUDPC by 135-205% in the long rains at both sites. Microclimatological observations made at Kabete during the long rains indicated reductions in leaf temperature and air temperature, and increases in relative humidity, in most plots. These changes were small, averaging 0-6-degrees-C, 0.2-degrees-C, and 1-8%, respectively. Wind velocity was reduced by 55-63% in the intercrop in relation to the monocrop. The results reflect the variable response of angular leaf spot to maize intercrops seen in other studies.

Interseeding or relay intercropping of CC is a technique that could overcome short planting windows constraints and allow CC establishment and growth. However, in Mediterranean regions this technique has been poorly implemented. Field experiments were established in Central Spain during two consecutive growing seasons to assess the performance of different species as interseeded crops into irrigated maize (Zea mays L.). The treatments included annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflontm L.) and eight legumes: burr medic (Medicago polymotpha L.), barrel medic (Medicago truncatula L.), yellow sweetclover (Melilotus officinalis L.), berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.), balansa clover (Trifolium michelanium L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), Persian clover (Trifolium resupinatum L.), and common vetch (Vicia sativa L.). A bare soil was included as control treatment. After the maize harvest, the four species with the best performance were planted as autumn cover crops in adjacent plots. The ground cover was studied throughout the experimental period, and biomass and N content for each species were determined in the autumn and in the following spring prior to the cover crop termination. The soil inorganic N content was determined in spring. Barrel medic, yellow sweetclover, common vetch and annual ryegrass were the species with the best performance in terms of soil coverage during the summer. Red clover and Persian clover had good establishment in one out of two years. None of the interseeded species impaired maize grain yield or quality. Interseeded species achieved better soil coverage and increased the biomass accrued at autumn compared to cover crops sown in October. Therefore, interseeded species ensured longer ground coverage, increasing the potential for soil quality improvement or weed suppression. Moreover, the higher biomass achieved by interseeded species ensured the survival of yellow sweetclover, which was winter killed when planted in the autumn. Interseeded cover crops enhanced the potential of N leaching reduction compared to autumn cover crops. This experiment confirms the suitability of different species interseeded in summer into irrigated maize in Mediterranean regions, and highlights the extra benefits of this practice in annual rotations.

Long-term yield sustainability and financial returns from grain legume-maize intercrops on a sandy soil in subhumid north central Zimbabwe	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article							"SMALLHOLDER; TILLAGE"	To measure the yield and financial returns from five grain legume-maize intercrop combinations over 12 years of cropping, a field experiment was conducted on a loamy sand soil in the subhumid unimodal rainfall environment of Domboshava in north-central Zimbabwe. Inputs and management followed smallholder practice, including partial grazing of crop residues and a zero mineral fertilizer treatment. The intercropped legumes grew moderately well most years. Cowpea averaged the highest grain yield (0.244 t ha(-1)) and haulm yield (1.54 t ha(-1)) over the 12 years, followed by pigeonpea and sugar bean. Intercropped pigeonpea yield was the least variable of the legumes over the years. Maize grain yield was highly variable across years with or without fertilizer and was reduced in years of low (533 mm) and high (1313 rum) rainfall. The pigeonpea-maize intercrop grown without fertilizer produced 0.11 t ha(-1) (6.25 %) more maize grain yield per year than sole crop maize, in addition to pigeonpea grain and haulms. Intercropped cowpea (which yielded more than double the above-ground non-grain biomass of pigeonpea) had less effect on maize grain yield. There was no trend to greater benefits from the legumes on maize yield after more years of intercropping. Net present values of annual margins accumulated over the 12 years for sole maize with fertilizer (US$1719 ha(-1)) and without fertilizer (US$935 ha(-1)) were higher than the fertilized and unfertilized intercropping options (US$1017 and US$745 ha(-1)). Pigeonpea or cowpea-unfertilized maize generated more financial returns than the other intercrops, but the low yields and high labour costs for the legumes made the intercrops financially unattractive. We conclude that regularly intercropped pigeonpea or cowpea can to a small extent help to maintain maize yield when maize is grown without mineral fertilizer on sandy soils in sub humid zones of Zimbabwe, and simultaneously provide some nutritious food, but that financial considerations will encourage smallholder farmers to persist with growing low input sole crop maize.

A two-year study was conducted on the Alfisols of Lilongwe and Dowa districts, Central Malawi, to assess the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungal colonisation levels in pigeon pea, cowpea, and maize grown in sole cropping, legume-cereal, and legume-legume intercropping systems and in the maize grown in short rotation (year 2) as influenced by the previous cropping systems and N fertilizer application. The gridline intersect method was used to assess the VAM fungal colonisation levels. Results showed that all treatments that included legumes whether grown as sole crop, in legume-cereal or in legume-legume cropping systems in the previous year, had significantly higher (P < 0.05) VAM fungal colonisation of the rotational maize crop roots by a range 39% to 50% and 19% to 47% than those in maize supplied and not supplied with N fertilizer, respectively, in a maize-maize short rotation, at the Lilongwe site. A similar trend was reported for the Dowa site. Furthermore, there were positive correlations between VAM fungal colonisation and the plant P content, dry matter yield, and nodule numbers. Further studies may help to assess the diversity of VAM fungal species in Malawi soils and identify more adaptive ones for inoculation studies.	"[Njira, Keston O.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the content of organic carbon in soil organic matter fractions, by three different methods, under maize-grass intercropping and sole maize in a dystrophic Red-Yellow Latosol (Oxisol). The following carbon contents were determined from the fractions: (i) of the particulate soil organic matter (POM) and from that (ii) of mineral-associated soil organic matter (MOC). The content of total organic carbon (TOC) was also determined in the non-fractionated soil organic matter. Three methods for the determination of soil organic carbon were used: (i) Walkley & Black modified, (ii) Mebius modified, and (iii) dry combustion in a CHN elemental analyzer. The experimental design was a randomized block design with three replications. Soil samples were collected from three management systems: (i) sole corn; (ii) maize-Panicum maximum intercropping; and (iii) maize-Brachiaria humidicola intercropping. Soil samples were collected from the depth of 0 - 5 cm. Lower TOC were found in the Walkley & Black method in relation to the CHN elemental analyzer, under the management systems sole maize and maize-Panicum maximum intercropping. However, the Walkley & Black method showed similar POM in relation to CHN analyzer method, under the management systems sole maize and maize-Brachiaria humidicola intercropping. TOC, POM and MOC obtained from the Mebius modified method were similar to those obtained from the elemental analyzer, under the three management systems. The POM when evaluated by the Mebius and CHN methods, showed to be more sensible to soil management alterations."

The overall efficiency of phosphorus absorption in intercropping decreased with increasing nitrogen level but a parallel increase in overall conversion efficiency maintained a constant and large land equivalent ratio (LER) up to the highest level of nitrogen. The increase in LER over unity, however, was due primarily to the greater total absorption of phosphorus by maize and mungbean together in intercropping compared with that when they were grown in pure stands.

A randomized complete block design was used, with four replicates, in split-plots. The intercropped systems were evaluated in the plots, and four nitrogen topdressing fertilization rates (0, 30, 60, and 90 kg ha(-1)) were evaluated in the split-plots. Forage dry matter and nutrient accumulation were determined in three stages: flowering, maize physiological maturity, and at forage desiccation, in October. Forage dry matter accumulation increases after the harvest of off-season maize. When forages are planted in the corn inter-rows, topdressing nitrogen fertilization does not influence forage dry matter and nutrient accumulation, and intercropping does not affect off-season maize grain yield.

Walp) grown in a mixture under greenhouse conditions. The plants were grown in root boxes for 5 weeks under 2 watering regimes; fully irrigated and water stress conditions, followed by a 5-day drying cycle imposed during the 6th week of growth. Water uptake patterns were analysed during the drying cycle. The two-dimensional distribution of the roots of both plants in the boxes was determined immediately at the end of the drying cycle. Under well-irrigated conditions, the roots of the component plants grew profusely into all sections of the root box and intermingled considerably. Water stress resulted in the decline of root growth of maize and cowpea but the root:shoot ratios of maize and cowpea were not affected, suggesting that there was no significant effect of water stress on root:shoot partitioning. However, water stress affected the biomass distribution between fine and coarse roots in cowpea. About 64% by weight of cowpea roots under water stress were coarse whereas as against 48% under well-irrigated conditions. Furthermore, water stress generally restricted the lateral extent of the roots of both maize and cowpea with a tendency of clumping together of the root systems and a reduced degree of intermingling. Thus, the extent of mixing of the root systems was apparently controlled by the availability of soil water. Water uptake from the well-irrigated soil in the root boxes was initially restricted to the sections directly below the base of each plant. Although roots of both plants were present in almost all sections of the root box, all the sections did not contribute simultaneously to water uptake by each plant. Water uptake was delayed from the middle intermingled zones. In effect, uptake patterns did not relate generally to the root distribution. The tendency was for the component plants to initially 'avoid' water uptake from zones of intense intermingling or competition."

Intercropping significantly reduced the seed yield of egusi melon by 66%, 75%, 78% and 78% in melon/cassava, melon/cassava/okra, melon/cassava/maize and melon/cassava/maize/okra intercrops, respectively, where a high leaf area index (LAI) cassava was used. Similar decreases in the fruit yield of okra under the high LAI cassava were 72%, 90%, 69% and 91% in okra/cassava, okra/cassava/maize, okra/cassava/melon and okra/cassava/maize/melon intercrops, respectively. On average, seed yield of egusi melon and fruit yield of okra were consistently higher where a low LAI cassava was used. The maize component significantly reduced the yields of the vegetable crops. Linear correlation between egusi melon seed yield and LAI (r = 0.889**) was highly significant and higher than that between okra fruit yield and LAI (r = 0.644*). This study suggests that high LAI cassava morphotypes would not be suitable for intercropping if the farmer expects reasonable intercrop yields from the vegetable components. Cassava cultivars with low LAI and high root yield characteristics and maize varieties that permit sufficient light to the middle and bottom canopy layers would enhance higher intercrop yields of the vegetable components.

Two field experiments were conducted simultaneously: common bean-maize intercropping and common bean in sole cropping. Intercropping increased common bean nodulation and biomass, mainly with Rhizobium, but mineral N was deleterious to nodulation. Inoculation also increased the Carioca cultivar yield most in sole cropping (+72%), but N levels did not affect common bean yield in either cultivar. Although intercropping reduced maize grain yield by 17%, the equivalent yield increased by 31%, whilst Rhizobium increased it by 11%. Despite the reduction of maize yield in intercropping, this system was shown to be more economically viable, in particular when common bean was inoculated with Rhizobium.

However, whether root contact facilitates N transfer and the extent to which N transfer contributes to crop productivity and N utilization have not been clarified. In our study, two-year rain shelter experiments were conducted to quantify the effect of root contact on N transfer in a maize/alfalfa intercropping system. N transfer occurred mainly one direction from alfalfa to maize during the growth period. Following the N0 treatment, the amount of N transfer from alfalfa to maize was 204.56 mg pot(-1) with no root barrier and 165.13 mg pot(-1) with a nylon net barrier, accounting for 4.72% and 4.48% of the total N accumulated in maize, respectively. Following the N1 treatment, the amount of N transfer from alfalfa to maize was 197.70 mg pot(-1) with no root barrier and 139.04 mg pot(-1) with a nylon net barrier, accounting for 3.64% and 2.36% of the total N accumulated in the maize, respectively. Furthermore, the amount of N transfer without no root barrier was 1.24-1.42 times higher than that with a nylon net barrier regardless of the level of N addition. Our results highlight the importance and the relevance of root contact for the enhancement of N transfer in a maize/alfalfa intercropping system.

The impact of intercropping maize (Zea mays L.) with potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) on yield, land equivalent ratios (LER), water equivalent ratio (WER), water use, energy output, and net economic return were examined under seven planting systems: potato grown solely or intercropped on the flat field without mulching, maize grown solely or intercropped with potato on ridges or flat field with or without plastic film mulched. The three intercropping systems had 3-13% less water use than the monocropping. Among the intercropped systems, flat field caused more depletion of soil water than ridged field for both years. Compared to monocultures, intercropping with plastic film mulching and ridging significantly increased LER and WER. Meanwhile, intercropping with mulching and ridging significantly increased net economic return and energy output by 8% and 24%, respectively, when compared to monocropping. These results suggest that maize under plastic film mulched ridge-furrow plot intercropped with potato under flat plot without mulching increased energy output, net economic return, and water use efficiency without increasing soil water depletion, which could be an optimal intercropping system for the semiarid farmland on the western Loess Plateau.

However, physiological and ecological mechanisms driving interspecific interaction shift along the environmental gradients is largely unknown. To clarify this issue, we first tested plant-plant facilitation along with four phosphorus (P) gradients in maize-grass pea intercropping system. Results illustrated a progressive transition of seed yield-based facilitation from mutually facilitated (+/+) to maize facilitated but grass pea as facilitator (+/-) along with low to high P gradients. Secondly, above trend was evidently enhanced when combining with drought stress gradients, in which severe drought amplified facilitative effects, whereas the magnitude of facilitation was relatively weak under well-watered condition. Interestingly, biomass-based facilitation transition did not synchronize with seed-based one, in which occurred in a broader threshold range of water and P gradients. Specifically, total yield, biomass, N and P uptake increased by 0.5%, 4.1%, 1.8% and 2.9% under the sufficient P and water availability, whereas these indicators increased by 25.3%, 18.5%, 20.5% and 21.4% in P and water deficient soils. And the total net effect was positive under all the environmental conditions. Rhizosphere interaction plays a crucial role in facilitation judgment, and the driving mechanism was associated with soil acidification and microbial community promotion under P-deficient condition. Under low soil moisture and available P, soil acidification and lower rhizosphere soil pH of intercropped maize were observed. Rhizosphere phosphatase secretion were significantly activated in P-deficient soils and accelerated the mineralization of soil organophosphorus, and the microbial biomass P was improved for stronger facilitation. Taken together, our findings confirmed the P and water driven facilitation shift along with stress gradients and highlighted the roles of rhizosphere interaction in affecting species diversity advantage. In conclusion, our work provided a relatively full picture for plant facilitation evaluation and more accurate management regarding intercropping productivity.

Assessment of different legumes for the control of Striga hermonthica in maize and sorghum	CROP SCIENCE			English	Article							"DESMODIUM SPP.; WITCHWEED; MANAGEMENT; AFRICA; STEMBORERS; VARIETIES; DENSITY; COWPEA; ROOT; SEED"	The witchweed, Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth., is a major constraint to maize (Zea mays L.) and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] production in sub-Saharan Africa. Intercropping maize and sorghum with desmodium (Desmodium spp.) effectively controls Striga and enhances grain yields. Studies were thus conducted to assess the potential role of intercropping maize and sorghum with different food legumes for control of Striga. Seasonal Striga counts in the intercrops, other than greenleaf desmodium where the counts consistently remained close to zero, were generally not significantly different from those in the control in both crops. A pooled analysis across seasons, however, showed that intercropping sorghum with cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.], greengram [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek], and crotalaria (Crotalaria ochroleuca G. Don), and maize with crotalaria significantly reduced Striga populations. Within-season analysis showed that it was only the greenleaf desmodium intercrop that maintained significantly enhanced grain yields relative to the control. On the other hand, multiseason analysis showed that it was only the crotalaria, cowpea, and greenleaf desmodium intercrops in maize and greenleaf desmodium intercrop in sorghum that significantly enhanced grain yields. These results indicate that intercropping sorghum with cowpea, greengram, or crotalaria and maize with crotalaria could be combined with other cultural methods for a sustainable control of S. hermonthica.

An effective integrated crop management strategy for enhanced maize production in tropical agroecosystems prone to gray leaf spot	CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						"Cercospora zeae-maydis; Zea maydis; Intercropping; Minimum tillage; Gray leaf spot"	"CERCOSPORA-ZEAE-MAYDIS; CORN RESIDUE; DISEASE; SPORULATION; RESISTANCE; PROGRESS; TILLAGE; GROWTH; LEAVES; OHIO"	Gray leaf spot is one of the most important yield-limiting diseases of maize (Zea mays L) and it is more severe in reduced tillage cropping where over-seasoning soilborne inoculum from infected crop debris provides primary inoculum for infection of the newly planted maize. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of intercropped beans on movement of soil surface inoculum and its overall impact on gray leaf spot severity and yield of maize. Conventional tillage with minimum soil surface inoculum was included for comparison. Trials were conducted in two cropping seasons using resistant ('UH6303'), moderately resistant ('Staha') and susceptible ('Pannar') maize varieties. Pooled data for susceptible maize during two growing seasons indicated that the area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) in the inter-cropping treatments was reduced by 12%, 15% and 23% in no-till, minimum, and conventional tillage treatments, respectively, compared to non-intercropping (P <= 0.05). The rate of disease increase (r) and the number of spores trapped during the season had similar trends. A moderately resistant cultivar displayed results similar to the susceptible cultivar, whereas treatment effects on resistant genotype were not significant. Yield was 21% higher in the intercropped compared to non-intercropped maize. Spore counts of Cercospora zeae-maydis trapped in the inter-cropping treatment were lower than in non-intercropped maize (P <= 0.05). It is concluded that the bean canopy in maize/bean intercrops created a barrier to movement of soilborne spores into the maize canopy, thus minimizing the number of leaves infected by wind-borne, and rain splash. The concomitant use of multiple management options (conventional tillage + inter-cropping + resistant variety) provided superior reduction of gray leaf spot severity and increased yield of maize.

Effects of low input tillage and amaranth intercropping system on growth and yield of maize (Zea mays)	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						"Tillage; intercropping; growth; yield"		Field experiments were conducted to find out the effects of tillage practices and intercropping on the growth and yield of maize at the teaching and research farm, university of Ado Ekiti, southwest Nigeria during the 2006 early and late growing seasons. The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with 3 replication with tillage practices (CT, MT, NT) assigned to main plots and cropping systems to subplots. At 8 WAP, the tallest plants of 134 cm were got with CT and sole cropping while the shortest plant, about 84 cm, was obtained from NT and intercropping. Application of CT and solecropping also had the widest leaf of 451cm(2) per plant while a leaf about 231 cm(2) was obtained from NT and intercropping. The same trend was obtained for the number of leaves per plant with CT and solecropping having the highest 11 leaves per plant. Land equivalent ratio was greater than unity in all treatments during both seasons. Aggressivity was negative for CT and MT and positive for NT while relative crowding coefficient was positive for all treatments. Maize grain yield was significantly highest, about 3 tonsha(-1), under CT and solecropping while the least yield, 2.12 tonsha(-1), was obtained from NT and intercropping. The results indicated that maize growth, intercropping efficiency and yield were well supported with CT.	"[Awe, G.

The experiments were done in 1991 at two sites in Brazil. The intercropping combinations were evaluated using an 8 x 8 quadratic lattice design with three replications. Two other experiments were done on monocultures, using a randomized complete block design with three replications. The variable considered was 'maize equivalent yield', obtained by adjusting for the price difference between the species. The method used showed that the differences in performance of the many intercropped combinations can be explained by 'general complementing ability' (gca) of each cultivar, since there was no significant effect of 'specific complementing ability' (sca). The best maize cultivars to be intercropped with common bean (indicated by high gca values) were BR-201 and C-525, which produced high grain yields when intercropped without detrimental effects on legume yields. FT-84-292, Carioca 300V and ESAL506 were the common bean cultivars with the highest yields when intercropped, which was also reflected in their good performance in monoculture. Significant cultivar x location interactions occurred only in monocultures, supporting the belief that intercropping is a more stable cropping system.

Data were collected from farms implementing the three CSA technologies, namely conservation agriculture (CA), maize-pigeonpea (Maize-PP) intercrops and a local organic and inorganic soil amendment known as Mbeya fertilization (Mbeya-fert), from 2018 to 2019. With respect to resilience and adaptation, particulate organic matter, soil organic carbon (SOC), N, P, K, Ca and Mg all significantly improved while bulk densities were lowered under the three CSA systems. Higher annual biomass inputs and improved water infiltration from the Maize-PP intercrops were observed. With respect to productivity, CA and Mbeya-fert improved maize yields by 51 and 19%, respectively, compared to conventional farmer practices. With regard to climate change mitigation, increases in measured SOC in the top 20 cm depth compared to the conventional farmer practices amounted to 6.5, 12 and 10.5 t C ha(-1) for CA, Mbeya-fert, and Maize-PP intercrops, respectively, over a period of 2-6 years. This suggests higher potential for carbon sequestration from CSA technologies. Furthermore, use of drought tolerant varieties, timely weeding and optimum plant populations, increased productivity. Improved gross margins from CSA practices were also apparent. Thus, employing these CSA technologies could enable farmers to be more resilient, productive and adapt better to climate change shocks leading to improved food security and livelihoods.

Is maize-cowpea intercropping a viable option for smallholder farms in the risky environments of semi-arid southern Africa?

There is limited experimental evidence on the mechanisms underlying benefits or risks in intercropping systems and below ground interactions in intercrops remain largely unstudied. Such understanding can inform strategies towards maximising returns to investments, particularly in poor fertility soils on smallholder farms in semi-arid areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Additive intercropping experiments were established covering several seasons (2010/11-2014/15) and different conditions (on-station and on-farm) to determine effects on soil chemical variables, root dynamics and yield of intercrops. Maize was planted with the first effective rains and received either no fertiliser or 40 kg N ha(-1). Cowpea was planted on the same date as maize or three weeks after planting maize in intercrops or sole stands and received no fertiliser. End-of-season available N was highest (P < 0.05) under the late planted intercrop with 40 kg N ha(-1) treatment in 2013/14. Addition of 40 kg N ha(-1) significantly increased maize grain yield by 500-1100 kg ha(-1) in the 2013/14 season. There was generally greater productivity and over-yielding in the intercrops compared with the sole crops; most intercrops had a land equivalent ratio > 1. Intercropping, however, resulted in compromised cowpea yields especially under the relay intercrop compared with the sole cowpea stands whilst maize yield was either not affected or improved. We attributed this to the lack of below-ground niche differentiation in root distribution between maize and cowpea. Maize cowpea intercropping with low doses of N fertiliser resulted in over-yielding compared with monocropping. Intercropping proved to be a robust option across seasons and soil types, confirming that it is a promising option for resource-poor smallholders."

Dual-purpose production of cowpea is most common in subsistence farming systems. Little is, however, known about the effects of cowpea leaf harvesting on tissue nitrogen composition and productivity of most cowpea-based cropping systems. A four-season study was carried out at the National Dry Land Research Center, Katumani, Kenya, to establish the effects of cowpea leaf harvesting initiation time and frequency on 1) tissue nitrogen content of cowpea and maize in a dual-purpose cowpea maize intercropping systems; and 2) cowpea and maize yield and the overall productivity of a cowpea maize intercrop measured by land equivalent ratio (LER). Cowpea leaf harvesting was initiated at 2, 3, or 4 weeks after emergence (WAE) and continued at 7- or 14-day intervals until onset of flowering. Cowpea tissue nitrogen content was highest in the control treatment and lowest in cowpea subjected to leaf harvesting from 2 WAE or at 7-day intervals, whereas maize tissue nitrogen content showed the reverse trend. Harvesting cowpea leaves from 3 WAE or at 7-day intervals gave the highest leaf vegetable yield, whereas grain yields were highest when no leaf harvesting was done. Maize yields were significantly improved by harvesting of leaves of the companion cowpea. Harvesting cowpea leaves for use as leaf vegetable increased productivity per unit area of land as measured by LER with the highest productivity achieved when leaf harvesting was initiated at 4 WAE or done at a 14-day interval."

In trapping studies in the field, more alate aphids were caught above maize canopies than above the bean crop level.

Bioactive Volatiles From Push-Pull Companion Crops Repel Fall Armyworm and Attract Its Parasitoids	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						"volatiles; tritrophic interactions; Push-Pull; maize; herbivory; companion crops; chemical ecology; behavioral response"	"COTESIA-MARGINIVENTRIS CRESSON; MAIZE; RESPONSES; INSECT; IDENTIFICATION; OVIPOSITION; MANAGEMENT; QUALITY; LEAVES; STRIGA"	Fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, is a serious invasive pest in Africa but Push-Pull companion cropping can substantially reduce infestation. Here, we elucidate the underpinning chemical ecology mechanisms. We hypothesized that companion crop volatiles repel herbivores (push) while attracting natural enemies (pull). Headspace volatiles collected from companion plants (Desmodium intortum, Desmodium uncinatum, Brachiaria Mulato II) were used in bioassays and electrophysiological recordings with S. frugiperda and parasitoid wasps. Insect populations, plant damage and herbivore parasitism were assessed in field plots. Coupled GC-electroantennogram (GC-EAG) recordings showed robust responses to certain aromatic and terpenoid volatile compounds. In wind tunnel bioassays, maize volatiles mixed with Desmodium volatiles were less attractive to moths than maize alone. In oviposition bioassays, S. frugiperda laid significantly fewer eggs on maize when Desmodium volatiles were present. Conversely, in an olfactometer bioassay, parasitoid wasps were attracted to the scent of both Desmodium spp. (intercrop) and the Brachiaria border crop. Our data provide evidence of the mechanisms underpinning reduced S. frugiperda infestation in the Push-Pull companion cropping system, i.e., volatiles from companion crops repel S. frugiperda while attracting its parasitoid natural enemies. These findings explain why Push-Pull field plots had fewer S. frugiperda larvae and lower crop damage than monocropped maize.	"[Sobhy, Islam S.; Bruce, Toby J.

In the present study, maize was cultivated during the wet and dry seasons in central Mexico for three consecutive years, under different treatments combining tillage with residue management techniques and with nitrogen rates. In some treatments, maize was also intercropped with jackbean, Canavalia ensiformis L. (DC). Yield and yield components as well as physiological traits and soil characteristics were assessed during the wet and dry seasons for the third year of cultivation. During the wet season, zero tillage was associated with less biomass and grain yield. Leaf chlorophyll concentration was smaller under zero tillage, suggesting less nitrogen uptake. Both zero tillage and residue conservation reduced early growth and strongly increased ear rot. During the dry season, zero tillage was associated with greater root mass, as measured by electrical capacitance. Residue conservation decreased the anthesis-silking interval, suggesting better water uptake. There was, however, no significant effect of tillage or residue management practices on yield. Zero tillage was found to be associated with increased soil bulk density, nitrogen concentration and microbial biomass organic carbon. Residue conservation increased soil carbon concentration as well as microbial biomass organic carbon. Intercropping with jackbean and conservation of its residues in addition to maize residues increased soil nitrogen concentration. Further investigation may provide more information on the factors related to zero tillage and residue conservation that affect maize early growth, and determine to which extent the observed modifications of soil chemical and physical properties induced by conservation tillage will further affect maize yield.

The aim of this study, conducted in 2009 and 2010, was to determine an optimal strip width in maize/bean strip intercropping. Treatments evaluated in the study were contribution of different strip width and intercrops of 2 rows bean and 2 rows maize (II), 3 rows bean and 3 rows maize (III), 4 rows bean and 4 rows maize (IV), 5 rows bean and 5 rows maize (V), maize and bean monocultures. The higher than average temperature in 2010, led to decrease crop yields in that year. The climatic conditions had more effect on reduction of bean yield than maize. Radiation absorption, radiation use efficiency, biological yield, land equivalent ratio, crowding coefficient and system productivity index were greater in 2009 than in 2010. Radiation use efficiency for maize and bean were higher in 2009 than 2010 (8.9% and 17.6% respectively). The strip intercropping system enhanced radiation absorption, radiation use efficiency, biological yield, land equivalent ratio, crowding coefficient and system productivity index compared with the monoculture system. Increasing strip width from 2 to 5 rows resulted in a decrease all the criteria measured. The best strip width was with II and III strip intercropping treatments. Although biological yield in intercropping was less than in monoculture, total land productivity was improved by greater land equivalent ratio (1.39 and 1.37). This means that 39% and 37% more land was required for monoculture than intercropping to produce the same yields in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Therefore it was demonstrated that an intercropping system is more effective than a monoculture system in resource utilization. It also appears that equivalent row numbers of 3 and 4 for each crop in a strip manner is more promising in resource use than other combination of rows. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To study the effect of the plants on nematodes, an experiment was set up in sandy, naturally-infested soil. The area was divided into strips, consisting of six blocks of 16 treatments, with eight winter treatments, subdivided on the basis of the fertilizer used (organic: bird litter, and synthetic: NPK). The initial nematode population was determined by sampling the soil (100 cm(3)) and weeds (10 g of root). The winter treatments put in place (bristle oats, chickpea, vetch bean, common bean, oilseed radish, wheat, intercropped bristle oats + oilseed radish and fallow), and the nematode population determined 100 days after sowing. Subsequently, two maize crops (summer and short season) were planted, and the nematode population in the soil and roots determined during crop full bloom. To evaluate the susceptibility of winter crops to nematodes, an experiment was conducted under controlled conditions, determining the nematode reproduction factor (RF) in the treatments described above. Both in the field and under controlled conditions, it was observed that the bristle oats, oilseed radish and intercropped oats + oilseed radish exhibited lower reproduction rates for P. brachyurus. In the field, lower population of nematodes was observed with the application of bird litter. Under controlled conditions, the highest RF were observed in the fallow plot and under common bean and chickpea, in that order.

Despite farmers' expressed interest and researchers' technological adaptations to reflect newly discovered on-farm constraints, farmers' adoption of these technologies remains limited, as does researchers' understanding of associated barriers. We investigate Malawian-smallholder farmers' incorporation of co-designed GLT into their maize-based systems after four years of intentional on-farm experimentation, focusing on understanding farmers' (n = 366) continued low levels of integration. We used mixed qualitative and quantitative methods within participatory action research to examine the potential effects of farmers' stated preferences and perceptions of GLT on their adoption choices. We found that farmers' adoption of GLT continues to remain low. Farmers preferred their traditional maize-dominated system to the majority of the studied GLT, for its perceived superiority in meeting farmers' food security and yield needs. Additionally, although GLT were less labor intensive than farmers' traditional maize systems in aggregate, farmers' cropping-system choices prioritized food security needs and were restricted by increased labor demand during time-sensitive labor tasks that have the potential to impact food security by decreasing on-farm maize production, specifically the task of planting. We identify potential entry points for future research that prioritize reducing the planting complexity of GLT in maize-dominated systems.

UTILIZATION OF ALLELOPATHY AND PLANTING GEOMETRY FOR WEED MANAGEMENT AND DRY MATTER PRODUCTION 0F MAIZE	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article							GROWTH	Undesirable impact of herbicides on environment had led to the efforts to search for alternative of herbicides. Allelopathy and planting geometry are possible alternatives for achieving sustainable weed management and dry matter production. The objective of this study was to evaluate the response of maize to allelopathy and planting geometry. Maize was planted in 75, 85 and 95 cm apart rows at New Developmental Farm, NWFP Agricultural University, Peshawar during 2006. Three allelopathic crops, sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) and mungbean (Vigna radiate Wilczek) were intercropped in maize rows alongwith sole maize with no weeding (control) and sole maize with hand weed control. Row spacing and allelopathic crops significantly affected plant height, weeds density and weeds biomass. Maize row spacing of 75 cm produced taller plants height (161.0 cm) and maximum stalk (7093.7 kg ha(-1)), whereas in allelopathic crop treatments, maximum plant height (170.9 cm) and stalk yield (8854.1 kg ha(-1)) were produced by hand weed control treatment. Sorghum intercropped with maize suppressed weeds density and resulted in low biomass of deela (Cyprus rotundus L.), field bind weed (Convolvulus arvensis L.) and itsit (Trianthema portulacastrum L.) compared with other treatments. It may be inferred from this study that weeds were better suppressed by 75 cm row spacing and sorghum intercropped plots.

Strip intercropping facilitates mechanized management, and has the potential to out yield monocropping by an optimized resource use of the intercropped species. Therefore we developed a light partitioning model, that calculates the available amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at the top of the canopy for a given point within a strip of a smaller, subordinate crop. The model was described, evaluated on various simulation time steps and tested for the purpose of designing strip-intercropping systems. PAR reaching the top of the canopy of various rows of the strip subordinate bush bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L var. nana) was measured continuously under different sky conditions. In the dominant strip, maize (Zea mays L) was grown. Then the model was tested for its ability to account for the influence of different widths of the bush bean strip, strip orientations and maize canopy architecture (height, leaf area index, and leaf angle distributions). Comparison between hourly averaged simulated and observed values of PAR across the bush bean strip showed a high accuracy of the simulations, under both, clear and cloudy conditions. Overall, simulations of hourly values of PAR across the bean strip showed a root mean square error (RMSE) ranging between 47 and 87 p,mol m(-2) s(-1) and a percent bias (PBIAS) ranging between -3.4 and 10.0%. A simulation time step of 20 min is recommended to preserve the accuracy of the model across the strip. The model captured reasonably the influence of strip design (width and orientation) and maize canopy architecture. Results suggested that the highest potential to increase PAR across the bush bean strip is by reducing height and leaf area index of maize, especially in the most shaded border row adjacent to the maize strip. The model proved to be a helpful tool for understanding the characteristics of light availability across the strip of the subordinate species and can be further used to examine a number of strip intercropping arrangements prior to labor and time consuming field trials.

Intercropping is accepted as a highly sustainable system to reduce soil erosion and ensure sustainable production by making efficient use of resources. Field experiments were conducted in the rainy season (July to September) during 2015, 2016, and 2017 to evaluate the effect of land slopes and maize and cowpea strip-intercropping on productivity and resource conservation at the Regional Research Station, Ballowal Saunkhri located in the Shivalik foothills. During three years of experimentation, a total of 23-26 runoff events were observed in the maize crop grown in the rainy season. The results from this 3-year field study indicate that maize grain yield was significantly higher on a 1% slope and cowpea on a 2% slope. This accounted for significantly higher net returns (US$ 428 ha(-1)) with a benefit-cost (BC) ratio of 2.0 on a 1% slope. Runoff, soil, and nutrient losses were higher on a 3% slope as compared to 1% and 2% slopes. N, P, and K loss on a 3% slope were 3.80, 1.82, and 4.10 kg ha(-1) higher, respectively than a 1% slope. The adoption of a strip-intercropping system with a 4.8 m maize strip width and 1.2 m cowpea strip width resulted in significantly higher maize equivalent yield than sole maize and other strip-intercropping systems. This system showed the highest land equivalent ratio value (1.24) indicating a 24% yield advantage over sole cropping systems of maize and cowpea, and fetched the highest net returns (US$ 530 ha(-1)) with a benefit-cost ratio (BC ratio) of 2.09. This system also reduced runoff and soil loss by 10.9% and 8.3%, respectively than sole maize crop. On all the land slopes, maize and cowpea strip-intercropping systems showed a significant reduction in N, P, K, and organic carbon loss as compared to sole maize. Thus, on sloping land, the maize and cowpea strip-intercropping system decreases surface runoff, soil, and nutrient loss, and increases yield and income of the farmers as compared to a sole maize crop.

The incidence of M. testulalis and H. armigera larvae was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in intercropped and higher plant populations than in pure stands and lower plant populations of common bean; larval populations of M. testulalis increased 45-59 d after planting, followed by a decrease up to 66 d after planting. Percentages of damage to flowers and pods by larvae of the two pod borer species were significantly (P < 0.05) lower in an intercrop combination of one-third bean-two-thirds maize (BMM) than in pure bean (BBB). Flower and pod damage decreased when plant populations increased from 66,666 to 1,333,333 plants per ba. The relationship of intercrop combinations and individual plant populations to incidence and damage by pod borer larvae was established by exponential and power regression models. Seed yields of intercrop combinations of BBM and BMM were higher than those of the two crops when grown in monoculture at 133,333 and 266,666 plants per ha. ''Relative yield total'' thus indicated yield advantages of 16-29% for plant populations of 133,333 plants per ha in both BBM and BMM intercrop combinations, which was associated with lower incidence and damage by pod borer species. Intercropping beans with maize was considered useful as a cultural method for controlling pod borers on common beans and for higher seed yield of the two crops."

Participatory selection of a maize (Zea mays L.) variety for the control of stem borers in a southeastern Nigeria location	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"Zea mays L.; stem borer infestation; resistant variety; participatory selection; pairwise comparison"	"CROP IMPROVEMENT; FARMERS; STRATEGY; IMPACT"	Participatory varietal selection is premised on the basis that only a small percentage of varieties developed by breeders are eventually utilized because farmers are left out of the selection process. Consequently a total of 275 farmers were engaged in the promotion of stem borer resistant maize varieties in the stem borer endemic maize growing ecologies of southeastern Nigeria over a three-year period. Results obtained revealed the superiority of the two tested stem borer resistant varieties over the local check with one of them, Ama-TZBR-W, being more preferred by farmers. The preferred variety had better overall appeal, increased number of ears harvested and almost a four-fold increase in the number of marketable cobs when compared with the local check under the predominantly intercropping pattern practiced in the region, especially in the late cropping season, a season with high incidence of borer infestation. Furthermore, cost-benefit analysis of the introduced technology showed a return of N35 for every Naira invested by the farmer on cultivation of resistant maize variety in the study area. Nonetheless, an acceptable maize variety for cultivation in the area should in addition to having borer resistance to ensure yield stability, must also have well filled cobs and good storability, two essential attributes for food security.

Field experiments were conducted during the 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons in the Guinean Savannah (Dang-Ngaoundere) and Sudano Sahelian (Gouna-Garoua) agro-ecological zones in Cameroon. Our experimental design was a split plot arrangement in a randomized complete block with four replications. The main factor was assigned to the use of insecticide (Cypermethrin) and sub plots were devoted for cropping systems. We compared the efficiency of intercropping to that of Cypermethrin application on the Yield of maize, cowpea and okra as influenced by insect pest damages. The comparison of monocropped sprayed by Cypermethrin to unsprayed showed that, in Dang, insect pests reduced maize yield by 37% and 24% in 2016 and 2017, respectively, whereas in Gouna, it was lower than 8% during the both years. Reduction in seed yield by insect pests on cowpea in Dang represented 47% and 50% in 2016 and 2017, respectively, whereas in Gouna, it was 55% and 63% in 2016 and 2017, respectively. For okra, insect pests reduced okra fruit yield by 25% and 44% in Dang and 23% and 28% in Gouna, respectively, in 2016 and 2017. Crop yield was lower in intercropping compared to monoculture due to competition of plants in association on different resources. Considering the total yields obtained from each intercropping, intercropping trials resulted generally in higher yields compared to mono-culture (LER > 1) in both sites and years but the respective yields were quite different. On the basis of the results obtained, we recommend maize-cowpea intercropping as a sustainable solution to reduce the infestation level of their pest insects.

The maize and cowpea planted under 1:2 ratio showed maximum values of growth parameters (i. e. plant height, number of leaves, leaf length, leaf width, stem girth, number of branches and leaf to stem ratio), nutrient content and their uptake (N and P) over 1:1 and 2:1 ratio. The significantly higher value aforesaid growth parameters of maize were recorded with applications of 90 kg N/ha. However, cowpea showed significantly higher value of growth parameters upto 60 kg N/ha. The highest total DMY (141.22 q/ha) and maize DMY (122.92 q/ha), net return ((sic)57089.42) and B:C ratio (1.72) were observed under 2:1 intercropping ratio. However, in case of cowpea, 1:2 intercropping ratio resulted in highest DMY (33.25 q/ha). Among fertility levels the significantly maximum total DMY, maize DMY and farm profitability, nutrient content and uptake by maize were observed with 120 kg N/ha. However, cowpea showed significantly increase in DMY up to 30 kg N/ha only. The 1:2 intercropping ratio resulted in 5.60 and 6.70% higher soil N and 4.00 and 2.57% higher soil P over 1:1 and 2:1 intercropping ratios. The use of 120 kg N/ha resulted 2.0, 6.6, 9.3 and 20.2% improvement in soil N over 0, 30, 60 and 90 kg N/ha, respectively. Thus it can be concluded that to realize higher productivity and farm profitability their planting 2:1 ratios with use of 120 and 60 kg N/ha, respectively is a viable option and may quite helpful in sustain the performance of livestock in terms of health and milk production.

The trials were planted under conditions of high inoculum pressure in 1995 and 1996 at a site in the lowland rainforest zone of southern Cameroon. In the 1995 experiment, the maize and cowpea intercrops reduced the final incidence of CMD in the cassava cvs. Dschang White and Dschang Violet, but not in the more resistant cv. Improved. In the 1996 experiment with cv. Dschang Violet, the maize and cowpea intercrops grown alone or together decreased adult whitefly populations on cassava by 50% and CMD incidence by 20%. The monomolecular population growth model generally provided the best fit for disease progress. Areas under the disease progress curves (AUDPCs) and incidences expressed as multiple infection units were significantly (P<0.05) less for cassava intercropped with maize and/or cowpea than in cassava alone; times to 50% CMD incidence were significantly (P<0.05) longer in all intercrop systems. In 1995 the basic infection rates (r ) were similarly low (0.010 per month) in the moderately resistant cv. Dschang Violet intercropped with maize and in all treatments in the more resistant cv. Improved. By contrast, rates were significantly higherfor cv. Dschang Violet alone or with cowpea and in all treatments for the less resistant cv. Dschang White (0.030-0.060). In 1996, r values in cassava grown alone (0.077) were significantly larger (P<0.05) than in the other cropping systems (0.042-0.052).

A 2-year field experiment with split-plot arrangements was conducted to study the effect of different planting patterns (monocropping and intercropping) and N fertilization (N0 and N 225 kg ha(-1)) on the PNUE of the maize with and without N fertilization in 2018-2019. The study findings showed that intercropping under nitrogen fertilizer application increased the yield and dry biomass of the maize crop by 23% and 14% and 25% and 18%, respectively, in 2018-2019. The land equivalent ratio (LER) was > 1, indicating more efficient use of the available resources by intercrops. Furthermore, the leaf chlorophyll, photosynthetic activities, and other leaf-related traits of maize crop showed an improved efficiency in intercropping when it was practiced with N fertilization, which resulted in a better PNUE as compared to monocropping. The study suggests that intercropping under nitrogen fertilization can improve the leaf photosynthetic activities and PNUE of the maize crop, thereby improving its yield. Therefore, adopting intercropping as an agronomic practice could be crucial for the betterment of the plant, while utilizing the available resources efficiently.

Two planting dates of corn: one at the same day of bean and the other 18 days after bean sowing were tested. Four planting patterns were tested at each date of sowing: one, two, three and four plants per hill. The distance between two hills was 20, 40, 60 and 80 cm, for each planting pattern on grain yield of maize and bean. When the planting date of corn was delayed, bean yield was higher than the sowing of the crops was done at the same time. There was no effect of corn planting date on maize yield. The intercropping systems tested didn't differ in relation to the efficiency of land use (UET) and show greater values of UET than the sole cropping systems.

Organic based nutrient management strategies: Effect on soil nutrient availability and maize (Zea mays L.) performance in Njoro, Kenya	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						"Biological nitrogen fixation; farm yard manure; improved legume fallow; residue management"	"BIOLOGICAL NITROGEN-FIXATION; SHORT-TERM; FIELD PEA; FALLOWS; HIGHLANDS; GROWTH; PRODUCTIVITY; DYNAMICS; INPUTS"	"A field experiment based on the concept of organic nutrient management (ONM) was conducted in Njoro, Kenya to test the effect of improved legume fallows; crotalaria (CR), lablab (LB), garden pea (GP) and natural fallow (NF, as control) on available soil N and P, and maize performance. The experimental layout was a split plot in a randomized complete block design. The main plots were two cropping systems involving the improved legume fallows and NF preceding sole maize and maize bean (M/B) intercrop. The sub-plots were two residue management types; residue incorporation and residue removal with farm yard manure (FYM) incorporated in its place. Incorporation of LB, CR and GP residues resulted in higher concentrations of N and P in soil than NF residue and FYM incorporation in both cropping systems. Under sole maize, grain yield following LB was significantly higher (51, 28.2 and 52%) than after CR, GP and NF, respectively. In the M/B intercrop, maize grain yield following LB was significantly higher (38.5 and 28.5%) than after GP and NF with no significant differences in yields following CR and LB. Maize dry matter (DM) yields followed a similar trend. Overall, maize grain and DM yields were higher in sole maize cropping system than in M/B intercrop with an additional 0.5 - 0.6 kg ha(-1) of bean grain yield obtained in the latter cropping system. The improved fallow legumes, with LB being superior, enhanced soil productivity and consequently higher yields of the succeeding crop. The ONM strategy tested is thus a feasible technology that could easily fit into the circumstances of the resource poor farmers within the region."	"[Lelei, J.

REDUCTION IN BEAN YIELDS	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article								Field studies were conducted to assess the effects of intercropping common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) with maize (Zea mays L.), at two growth stages and four row spacings (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 m), on Aphis fabae infestation of beans and on the magnitudes of bean yield losses due to aphid attack and to competition by maize. The first maize planting (Old maize) was carried out 3 weeks earlier than beans, while the second planting (Young maize) was done simultaneously with beans. Significantly (P<0.05) fewer plants were infested by A. fabae when beans were intercropped with older or densely planted maize. Aphid colonies on beans were also smaller, and there was reduced aphid damage to beans in the intercrops. However, whereas bean yield loss from aphid attack was less than 3.5% in all intercrop situations, yield loss from competition by maize was very high, being up to 98% when beans were intercropped with early-planted maize at 0.5-m row spacing. Yields of intercropped maize planted at row spacings of 0.5, 1.5 and 2.0 m were also depressed. The results show that both maize growth and row spacings could be exploited for the control of A. fabae on intercropped beans. However, adequate consideration must be given to the negative effects of maize planting density and growth on yields of both crops.

For this purpose, a nutrient solution was used with the tolerant (L922) and sensitive (Ast214) homozygous parental lines, with the segregating generation F-2 and with the F-2:3 lines derived thereof. Seeds were germinated on paper and seedlings transferred to a nutrient solution containing 4.5 mg L-1 aluminum. In the experiments involving F-2:3 derived lines groups of rows with F-2:3 plants were intercropped with rows of eight seedlings of the parental lines in a completely randomized block design. Results of the F-2 generation demonstrated a bimodal distribution of relative frequencies, with approximately three times more seedlings in the tolerant group. This suggests the participation of only one locus in tolerance inheritance. The narrow-sense heritability (F-2, F-2:3) of seminal root length of F-2 plants and means of F-2:3 lines was 0.49. which partially explained the bimodal frequency distribution of means of F-2:3 lines, but was not accurate enough to differentiate tolerant from sensitive groups.

Wide development of relay strip intercropped soybean has contributed to the soybean industry in China. Due to the shading from maize, growth and grain production of soybean is reduced. However, whether soybean isoflavonoid accumulation pattern is influenced in the relay strip intercropping system is still unclear. Here, we studied the accumulation patterns of soybean isoflavones in the relay strip intercropping system and sole cropping system at the per-harvest stage. The accumulation patterns of soybean isoflavones at the postharvest stage were also studied. The results indicated that accumulation patterns of soybean isoflavones of all varieties in leaf and seed in the two systems were similar, but the trend was delayed in the relay strip intercropping system compared with the sole cropping system. During the pod filling stage, the total content of isoflavone, M-type isoflavone content, G-type isoflavone content in seed in the relay strip intercropping system were lower than those in the sole cropping system. During the after-ripening period, seed isoflavone content, M-type isoflavone content, G-type isoflavone content in seed increased in both systems, but were higher in the relay strip intercropping system. The temperature and photosynthetically active radiation were significantly lower in relay intercropping than in sole cropping, while relative humidity showed the opposite trend. Path analysis showed that total isoflavone content in leaves and seeds showed a significantly positive correlation with temperature and photosynthetically active radiation, but significantly negative correlation with relative humidity. Correlation analysis between the highest isoflavone content in sole cropping or relay intercropping seeds and agronomic traits revealed a significant positive correlation between the number of both branches and pods with total isoflavone, M-type isoflavone and G-type isoflavone in both systems.

In 1993, a long-term field experiment on sustainable crop rotation and ley farming systems was initiated on a Colombian acid-savanna oxisol to test the effects of grain legumes, green manures, intercrops and leys as possible components that could increase the stability of systems involving annual crops. In the present study, five agropastoral treatments ( maize monoculture, maize-soybean rotation, maize-soybean green manure rotation, native savanna, maize-agropastoral rotation) under two tillage systems ( no tillage and minimum tillage) were investigated. Lower bulk density and higher total porosity for all treatments and soil layers were found in no-tillage compared to the minimum tillage system. Between the two tillage systems, significantly higher maize grain yields (p < 0.1) were obtained under no-tillage agropastoral treatments compared to the same treatments under minimum tillage. Maize yields on native savanna soils were markedly lower than in the rest of the treatments, indicating the need for improved soil conditions in subsoil layers for root growth of maize.

The benefits of conservation agriculture on soil organic carbon and yield in southern Africa are site-specific	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH			English	Article						"Crop rotation; Intercropping; Profitability; Maize; Reduced tillage; Soil conditions"	"FARMING SYSTEMS; MAIZE YIELD; NO-TILLAGE; SEQUESTRATION; MATTER; PRODUCTIVITY; PERSPECTIVE; DYNAMICS; REGIONS; TROPICS"	Conservation agriculture (CA), with reduced tillage, permanent soil cover and diversified cropping systems, is advocated in southern Africa to improve soil quality, reduce input costs and mitigate climate-induced risks. However, improvements in terms of yield and soil organic carbon (SOC) under CA are slow and variable and many small-scale farmers are unable to buffer themselves against potential short-term financial losses. In this study we examined the effects of CA-related management practices on SOC sequestration and productivity at two medium-term sites on a sandy soil (eight year trial) and clay soil (six years) in maize producing areas of South Africa. Using field data, current input costs and market prices for crops, we calculated the gross margin for each system. Treatments compared conventional ploughing under maize monoculture with reduced tillage, intercropping and crop rotation. On the clay soil, SOC was increased under reduced tillage (57.6 t C ha(-1)) compared to conventional tillage (54.9 t C ha(-1)) while there was no difference for the sandy soil (19.7 t C ha -1 average across treatments). Profitability was most strongly influenced by seasonal rainfall, but was higher on the sandy soil than the clay soil, with an average gross margin of R11,344 ha(-1) and R5,686 ha(-1), respectively. This study has demonstrated that while certain CA practices can create site-specific benefits for farmers, it is highly dependent on local weather and soil conditions. For the clay soil an additional payment scheme would be required to reward farmers in southern Africa for C-sequestration to make CA profitable and achieve increased C-mitigation through soil sequestration.

However, little is known about the income risk reduction associated with maize-legume strip cropping in West Africa. A 3-yr study was conducted in Upper West and Northern regions of Ghana to determine the effect of maize-legume strip cropping on productivity, income, and income risk using a randomized complete block design with five replications in each region. Seven treatments were used: sole crops of maize (M) cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] (C) and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) (G), a combination of two rows of M and two rows of legumes (L) (2M:2C and 2M:2G), and two rows of M and four rows of L (2M:4C and 2M:4G). Maize-legume strip cropping options (2M:2L and 2M:4L) on the average saved 90-100% of agricultural land, significantly increased income by about threefold, and reduced risk of operating at a financial loss by 75% compared with sole cropping. Smallholder farmers, especially sole legume cropping farmers in the Guinea savanna of northern Ghana and similar agro-ecologies in West Africa, could adopt maize-legume strip cropping systems (2M:4L or 2M:2L) to mitigate production risk and increase financial return.

Root exudates influence chemotaxis and colonization of diverse plant growth promoting rhizobacteria in the pigeon pea-maize intercropping system	RHIZOSPHERE			English	Article						"Rhizosphere; Organic acids; Cajanus cajan; Zea mays; Biofilm"	"ORGANIC-ACIDS; BIOFILM FORMATION; RHIZOSPHERE; PHOSPHORUS; NODULATION; IDENTIFICATION; FACILITATION; CHICKPEA; NITROGEN; CARBON"	Intercropping, the co-cultivation of two or more plant species in the same field, has several advantages over growing only one plant species, however, the role of plant-microbe interactions in such a setup is poorly understood. To investigate the influence of rhizosphere colonization by plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) in an intercropping system, a model legume-cereal intercropping system involving maize (Zea mays) and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) was assessed for colonization using three different bacterial strains Enterobacter sp. C1D, Pseudomonas sp. G22, Rhizobium sp. IC3109. Cross colonization experiments suggested bacterial movement from one plant species to another in the presence/absence of a mesh barrier, implicating the role of intercrop root exudates. In vitro assays and plant inoculation studies displayed that Enterobacter sp. C1D had a preference for monocropped plants while Rhizobium sp. IC3109 to intercropped plants and Pseudomonas sp. G22 was evenly colonized in both conditions. Organic acids like fumarate, malate, and succinate, as analyzed by LC/MS/MS (MRM), were found to be prominent in monocropped plant root exudates, while co-cultivation resulted in a decrease of the exudation of these metabolites. The PGPR strains showed differential behavioral responses in terms of chemotaxis and biofilm formation towards root exudates of intercropped and monocropped plants. Overall, our study provides pieces of evidence that co-cultivation of legume and cereal plants leads to the variation in root exudates and the response of plant beneficial bacteria.

Plantain at a density of 1666 plants ha(-1) was intercropped with three densities of melon 5000 plants ha-1, 10000 plants ha-1, and 20000 ha(-1) ts 700 plants ha-1, 20 plants ha(-1), and 1 53000 plants ha-1), and cassava (5000, and 10 000 plants ha(-1). All crops were also planted in monoculture at their recommended spacing of 20 000 plants ha-1, 53 000 plants ha-1, and 10 000 plants ha(-1) for melon, maize, and cassava, respectively. There were 13 treatments replicated four times in a randomised complete block design. The results of the experiment showed that intercropping melon up to 20 000 plants ha-1 had no significant effect on plantain, but maize and cassava at the densities of 53 000 plants ha(-1) and 10 000 plants ha-1, respectively, significantly delayed the days to shooting of plantain by 34 days and 159 days, respectively. Plantain bunch yield was also reduced by 28% and 46% in intercrop with maize and cassava, respectively, when compared with sole plantain. The total relative yield of all population mixtures was greater than one land equivalent ratio [(LER) > 1] but the contribution of plantain to the LER was reduced as the population of maize and cassava increased in the intercropping system. The economic returns of each intercrop showed that intercropping plantain with melon at 20000 plants ha(-1) gave a higher return than the other combinations. Generally, productivity of plantain in these intercropping systems was in the order of melon > maize > cassava.

Modeling fall armyworm resistance in Bt-maize areas during crop and off-seasons	JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE			English	"Article; Early Access"						"Monte Carlo simulation model; Intercropping; Transgenic crops; Spodoptera frugiperda"	"SPODOPTERA-FRUGIPERDA LEPIDOPTERA; INSECT RESISTANCE; TRANSGENIC CROPS; MANAGEMENT STRATEGY; JE SMITH; NOCTUIDAE; EVOLUTION; REFUGE; ADAPTATION; DYNAMICS"	Entomologists have often used computational modeling to study the dynamics of insects in agricultural landscapes. Recently, important issues such as the movement of adults and immatures associated with insect resistance to GMO (genetically modified organism) crops have been addressed using computational models. We developed an individual-based model using the cellular automata approach (CA) to investigate how an intercropping system composed of maize engineered with Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) gene, refuge areas (non-Bt maize), and grasses combined with off-season periods might influence the evolution of resistance in Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), one of the leading agricultural pests targeted by GMOs. We designed the Bt and non-Bt plants in two different arrangements: (a) a seed mixture and (b) strips rows, adding grasses in areas adjacent to the field. We added the seasonal planting dynamics (crop season and off-season), to evaluate a total of six agricultural scenarios. We followed a crop calendar from the United States to create simulations close to agricultural practice. The results showed that the frequency of the resistance allele was strongly related to the landscape arrangements and their dynamics. Since the adult insects are mobile, the seed-mixture scenario increased the frequency of the resistance the most (95.86%), followed by strips (82.10%), without grass fields. The maize harvest made it possible to reduce the frequency of resistance allele below 1%. Based on our results, we can expect that the maintenance of pasture areas, for instance next to the corn crops, will act as a reservoir of susceptible insects during off-season periods.

Field trials were conducted to determine the incidence of species of parasitoids and their rate of parasitism on selected IPM treatments. The experiment was conducted at crop Museum of Sokoine University of Agriculture, Morogoro, Tanzania for two cropping seasons and arranged in a split - split-plot design with three replicates. The treatment combinations were push-pull without application of pesticides, push-pull and Beauveria bassiana, push-pull and Metarhizium anisopliae sensu lato, push-pull and flubendamide, cowpea + maize without application of pesticides, and cowpea + maize and Beauveria bassiana. Others were cowpea + maize and Metarhizium anisopliae sensu lato, cowpea + maize and flubendamide, maize sole crop without application of pesticides, maize sole and Beauveria bassiana, maize sole and Metarhizium anisopliae, and maize sole and flubendamide. The results showed that one species of egg-larva parasitoids (Chelonus bifoveolatus) and two species of larva parasitoids (Coccygidium luteum and Cotesia sp.) were recovered from the sampled fall armyworm eggs and larvae. The percentage of parasitism of C. bifoveolatus and C. luteum differed significantly among intercropping systems (p < .001). The results also showed that the percentage of larval parasitism of Cotesia sp. differed significantly (p < .001) among intercropping systems only.

We therefore extended the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to an annual and perennial intercrop by integrating annual and perennial APSIM modules. These were parameterized for Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) or creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra L.) as PGC using a 3-yr dataset. Our objectives for this intercropping modeling study were to: (a) simultaneously model a PGC and annual cash crop using APSIM software; (b) utilize APSIM to understand interactive processes in the maize-PGC system; and (c) utilize the calibrated model to explore both production and environmental benefits via scenario modeling. For the first objective, the integrated model successfully predicted maize total aboveground biomass (relative root mean square error [RRMSE] of 13-27%) and PGC above- and belowground tissue N concentration (RRMSE of 11-18%). The calibrated model captured observed trends in PGC biomass accumulation and soil nitrate. For the second objective, model analysis showed that competition for light was the primary PGC-related maize yield-penalty factor, while water and N affected maize yield later in the growing season. In the third objective, we concluded that effective PGC suppression produces minimal maize-yield loss and significant environmental benefits; conversely, poor groundcover suppression may produce unfavorable environmental consequences and decrease maize grain yield. Effective PGC suppression is key for long-term system success."	"[Bartel, C. A.] Cornell Univ, Morrison Hall,48 Judd Falls Rd, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Archontoulis, S. V.; Lenssen, A. W.; Moore, K.

Maize (Zea mays L.) was planted in two consecutive years in Costa Rica to measure changes in soil mineral N, soil C, and maize grain N in response to monoculture or polyculture and legume residues or NH4NO3 fertilizer under conventional (CT) or minimum (MT) tillage. Soil mineral N levels were greater with fertilizer than with residues at the end of the first season and greater with residues at the beginning of the second season, reflecting a residual effect from the previous season. There were no treatment interactions. The dominant form of mineral N shifted from NO3--N (first season) to NH4+-N (second season). The shift corresponded to an overall increase in soil C (from 27.6 to 30.2 g kg(-1)), which was significantly greater under monoculture and with residues (33.2 and 33.4 g kg(-1), respectively) than under polyculture and fertilizer (31.1 and 30.9 g kg(-1), respectively). A positive cropping system x N source interaction resulted in 67% greater maize grain N in the polyculture under residues than with fertilizer N. Maize response to polyculture and legume residues, together with soil N and C data, were used to propose a mechanistic explanation for how these strategies may help maintain productivity (and minimize N loss) in low-input farming systems.

Production benefits and risks of four soil fertility and food legumes, pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan), groundnut (Arachis hypogea), tephrosia (Tephrosia vogelii) and mucuna (Mucuna pruriens), intercropped or rotated with maize, were compared by 32 farmers in 4 farmer resource groups (RGs) of different wealth status. The calculation of lower confidence limits was Used to determine the production risk of the crops. Alternative crop technologies presented different risks to farmers of different wealth states, and the degree of risk affected their choice of soil fertility management strategy. The better-resourced farmers (RG 1) had larger yields with all crop combinations than the poorly resourced farmers (RG 4). Legumes integrated with maize significantly (p < 0.001) raised maize grain yields between 0.5 t ha(-1) and 14 t ha(-1), when compared with sole crop unfertilized maize. Fertilized maize was less of a risk for the better-resourced farmers (RG 1 and RG 2), and it yielded well when combined with the legumes. Maize-legume intercrops yielded more and were associated with less risk than the maize-legume rotations. Maize intercropped with pigeonpea was predicted overall to be the least risky technology for all RGs. We conclude that new crop technologies may pose more risk to poorly resourced farmers than to wealthier farmers.	"[Giller, K.

EVALUATION OF ORGANIC AND INORGANIC MULCHING AS AN INTEGRATED WEED MANAGEMENT STRATEGY IN MAIZE UNDER RAINFED CONDITIONS	PLANTA DANINHA			English	Article						"Zea mays; mulch materials; net benefits; weed density; weed biomass"	"GROWTH; WHEAT; YIELD; L.; HERBICIDES"	Weeds affect crop growth, health and yield by competing for resources, and they serve as refuge for insect pests. Mulches of different materials have been found to control weeds and insect pests. A field study was conducted at the village of Mang, Haripur, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, to explore the effect of various mulch materials on weed suppression in maize fields under rain-fed conditions in 2013. Eight mulch materials treatments were used: control (no mulching), wheat straw mulch, dry leaves of eucalyptus, rice straw mulch, grass clippings, living mulch (soybean crop), black plastic mulch and the herbicide Primextra were investigated under a randomized complete block design with four replications. Statistical analysis of data showed maximum reduction in weed density, relative weed density, fresh biomass and dry biomass in all the test species at 25, 50 and 75 days after sowing (DAS) where Primextra and black plastic mulch were used, and this was statistically similar to where rice straw and wheat straw were used. Maximum weed density, relative weed density, fresh and dry biomass of all weed species were recorded where soybean was intercropped with maize and grass clippings were used. Based on these results, it was inferred that the mulch material of eucalyptus and rice straw can effectively be used for controlling weeds in maize fields under rain-fed conditions.

These bacteria improves plant's performance under normal and adverse conditions including nutrient limitation, climate change and infections. Recently renewable energy (biodiesel) crop Jatropha curcas L (J. curcas) has received enormous support for mass cultivation. In addition, intercropping of J. curcas with agriculturally important crops has been recommended to improve crop yield. This plant easily grows under harsh environment and limited nutrient availability. It is hypothesized that J. curcas is capable of sustaining under theese challenging environment with the help of its beneficial microorganisms. Experiments were carried out to characterize the culturable endophytic bacteria of J. curcas and evaluate their plant growth promoting effect on maize (Zea mays L.). Population of culturable endphytic bacteria varied from 0.8 x 10(3) to 1.2 x 10(3) colony forming units (cfu) g(-1) fresh plant tissue. Fifteen isolates were sequenced and characterized based on their carbon source utilization and plant growth promoting activities. 16 S rRNA genes of these isolates were mainly homologous to Paenibacillus, Brevibacillus, Sphingomonas and Rhizobium. These isolates preferred to grow on methanol, ethanol, glucose, fructose, sucrose, and gelatine. A Principal component analysis highlighted that PC1 contributed 43.32% variation while PC2 rendered 14.01% variation. These strains exhibited catalase, nitrate reductase, ACC deaminase and phosphatase activities. All isolates were positive towards phosphates and IAA production. Phosphatase activity (mg of PO4 released d(-1)) varied from 0.107 to 0.298, while IAA production ranged from 0.51 to 13.56 mu g 10-6 cells 2d(-1). Inoculation of the endophytes to maize seeds increased shoot and root length of seedlings significantly (p < 0.01) than the non-inoculated. Study highlighted that endophytic bacteria of J. curcas possesses plant growth promoting attributes which can be explored as microbial inoculants for agricultural crops.

Functional N-cycle genes in soil and N2O emissions in tropical grass-maize intercropping systems	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						"Zea mays L.; Biological nitrification inhibition; Urochloa; Megathyrsus; N fertilization; qPCR"	"AMMONIA-OXIDIZING ARCHAEA; NITROUS-OXIDE EMISSIONS; NICHE DIFFERENTIATION; QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSES; NOSZ GENES; NITRIFICATION; BACTERIA; DIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; DENITRIFICATION"	There is evidence that forage grasses such as Megathyrsus and Urochloa can suppress nitrification, with direct or indirect consequences on soil inorganic N dynamics and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. However, the influence of soil chemical properties on the dynamics of functional N-genes and losses of N in maize (Zea mays L.) inter cropped with forage grasses under N fertilization is poorly understood. In this study, soil samples and N2O emissions were analyzed from a field experiment in which maize (fertilized or not with ammonium-based fertilizer) was intercropped with Guinea grass (M. maximus cv. Tanzania), palisade grass (U. brizantha cv. Marandu), and ruzigrass (U. ruziziensis cv. Comum). Soil N-cycle microorganisms [16S rRNA of bacteria and archaea, nifH (gene encoding N2-fixing bacteria), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA), nirS (encoding nitrite reductase), and nosZ (encoding nitrous oxide reductase)] were influenced by forage grass, N fertilization, and sampling time, but no evidence of biological nitrification inhibition was found. Palisade grass was associated with a higher abundance of nifH (7.0 x 105 gene copies g-1 soil, on average) in the absence of N compared with the other grasses (4.3 x 105 gene copies g-1 soil, on average). Nitrogen fertilization increased the abundance of AOB but not AOA. Furthermore, N2O flux was influenced by AOB, water-filled pore space, and N fertilization, whereas the cumulative N2O emission and fertilizer-induced emission factor (0.36%, on average) were not affected by the grasses. In conclusion, this study reveals the strong dominance of AOB under ammonium supply, potentially stimulating N2O emissions in maize-forage grass intercropping systems.

The aim of this research was to evaluate the potential of winter cover crops and their management timing in reducing weed infestation in maize crop. Two experiments were carried out in Canoinhas, SC, Brazil, in 200312004 and 2004/2005. In the first experiment, six winter cover crops were investigated: oilseed radish, black oat, rye, rye grass, intercropped among black oat and common vetch and among oilseed radish, black oat, rye, ryegrass and common vetch. These cover crops were slashed down at three different times before maize seeding (1, 10 and 25 days). In the second experiment, the potential to reduce weed infestation was investigated in the six cover crops previously mentioned, plus the common vetch. The straw of ryegrass and from intercropping among the five species used in this study had a high capacity to suppress weed emergence and dry matter production, while oilseed radish straw showed low weed suppression potential. The winter cover crops slashed down next to maize seeding reduced weed infestation.	"[Balbinot, A. A., Jr.] UFPR, Programa Posgrad Agron, Recife, PE, Brazil; [Balbinot, A. A., Jr.; Backes, R.

Intercropping Kernza with legumes may be a sustainable way of supplying nitrogen to soil and associated intercrop. We determined the competitive interactions between intercropped Kernza (K) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) (A) under three inorganic nitrogen (N) rates N0, N1, N2 (0, 200, 400 kg ha(-1)) and five species relative frequencies (SRF) (100%K:0%A, 75%K:25%A, 50%K:50%A, 25%K:75%A and 0% K:100%A) in mixed intercrops (MI) in a greenhouse pot experiment. After 11 weeks of growth. Kernza dry matter yield (DM) and N accumulated (NACC) were low, but alfalfa DM and NACC high at 0 kg N ha(-1). 200 and 400 kg N ha(-1) fertiliser application increased the competitive ability (CA) of Kernza and reduced the CA of alfalfa. SRF had large impacts on alfalfa DM, NACC and NFIX only at 0 kg N ha(-1) fertiliser, and insignificant impacts on Kernza at all N fertiliser levels, indicating that adjustment of SRF may not be an effective way to modulate the interspecific competition of Kernza. Further research on the other factors that influence the interspecific competition are warranted.

J	"Raji, SG; Dorsch, P"				"Raji, Shimelis Gizachew; Dorsch, Peter"			Effect of legume intercropping on N2O emissions and CH4 uptake during maize production in the Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							"NITROUS-OXIDE EMISSIONS; GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; METHANE OXIDATION; COVER CROPS; SMALLHOLDER FARMS; CARBON-DIOXIDE; CLIMATE-SMART; SOIL; DENITRIFICATION; RESIDUES"	Intercropping with legumes is an important component of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) in sub-Saharan Africa, but little is known about its effect on soil greenhouse gas (GHG) exchange. A field experiment was established at Hawassa in the Ethiopian rift valley, comparing nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes in minerally fertilized maize (64 kg N ha(-1)) with and without Crotalaria (C. juncea) or lablab (L. purpureus) as intercrops over two growing seasons. To study the effect of intercropping time, intercrops were sown either 3 or 6 weeks after maize. The legumes were harvested at flowering, and half of the above-ground biomass was mulched. In the first season, cumulative N2O emissions were largest in 3-week lablab, with all other treatments being equal to or lower than the fertilized maize mono-crop. After reducing mineral N input to intercropped systems by 50% in the second season, N2O emissions were comparable with the fully fertilized control. Maize-yield-scaled N2O emissions in the first season increased linearly with aboveground legume N yield (p = 0:01), but not in the second season when early rains resulted in less legume biomass because of shading by maize. Growing-season N2O-N emission factors varied from 0.02% to 0.25% in 2015 and 0.11% to 0.20% in 2016 of the estimated total N input. Growing-season CH4 uptake ranged from 1.0 to 1.5 kg CH4-C ha(-1), with no significant differences between treatments or years but setting off the N2O-associated emissions by up to 69 %. Our results suggest that leguminous intercrops may increase N2O emissions when developing large biomass in dry years but, when mulched, can replace part of the fertilizer N in normal years, thus supporting CSA goals while intensifying crop production in the region.

J	Obiagwu, CJ				Obiagwu, CJ			Estimated yield and nutrient contributions of legume cover crops intercropped with yam, cassava, and maize in the Benue River Basins of Nigeria	JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION			English	Article								Intercropping trials were established in the sandy soils of the Benue River Basins of Nigeria to assess the effect of some food legumes used as cover crops in cassava, yam, and maize based cropping systems. The soil productivity and yield contributions of ground akidi (Sphenostylis stenocarpa), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), local (Kafanji), and improved (IAR-355) cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) varieties to the main crops were assessed and presented on a fertilizer-equivalent basis. The cowpea varieties and ground akidi helped maize to increase the efficiency of nitrogen (N)-phosphorus (P)-potassium (K) fertilizer use by producing an additional 2.74 and 1.59 kg grains/kg, respectively. While an additional six tons of yam tubers was contributed by the kafanji intercrop per hectare, only about three tons was contributed by ground akidi. With the exception of pigeon pea, the test legumes were suitable for use as cover crops for cassava, yam, and maize in the Benue River Basins of Nigeria.

LEGUME ADOPTION IN MAIZE-BASED SYSTEMS OF NORTHERN THAILAND: CONSTRAINTS AND POTENTIALS	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						"adoption constraints; legume integration; relay cropping; selection criteria; smallholder farmers"	"LAND-USE; SOIL CONSERVATION; SOUTHEAST-ASIA; NITROGEN; MANAGEMENT; INTENSIFICATION; COMPETITION; FIXATION; BENEFITS; REGION"	"A considerable growth in the maize (Zea mays L.) sector in Southeast Asia has resulted in a rapid expansion and intensification of maize monoculture on sloping uplands. This practice entailed the heavy use of fertilisers, leading to environmental degradation and farmers' indebtedness. Intercropping of legumes with maize could complement or replace fertiliser inputs; however legume adoption by smallholder maize farmers remains low. This study investigates the constraints and potentials to integrate legumes in maize-based cropping systems in such environments. A comparative study between maize monocropping and maize/legume relay cropping was carried out in two villages of Thailand, using surveys, participatory rural appraisal (PRA) tools and interviews. The results demonstrated that both cropping systems were equally profitable, although the maize yield in maize/legume relay cropping was lower than that in monocropping. Low selling price was the most cited reason by the non-adopters for not introducing legumes. Selling price of legume grains, ease of harvesting, marketability and ease of growing were the four main criteria that determined the adopters' choice of legume species. Among the cultivated legumes, ricebean (Vigna umbellata L.) best fulfilled the criteria for the choice of legume species. Establishing maize/legume relay cropping as an alternative to maize monocropping under rainfed conditions can decrease risks, due to reduced expenses for farm inputs and similar economic returns. This study generated useful information for agricultural policy makers and development practitioners in identifying the barriers and facilitating factors that influence farmers' decision to adopt legumes and the conditions that shape the farmers' decision-making environment.

This study examines the effects of CA practices on crop productivity, profitability and soil quality under the conditions encountered by smallholder farmers in two farming communities from 2005 to 2011 in Malawi, as part of the contribution to remedy a lack of supporting agronomic research for these relatively new systems. The drier agroenvironment of Lemu of Bazale Extension Planning Area (EPA) is characterized by sandy clay loam soils and lower rainfall. Here, CA showed positive benefits on maize yield after the first season of experimentation, with highest increases of 2.7 Mg ha(-1) and 2.3 Mg ha(-1) more yield in CA monocrop maize and CA maize-legume intercrop, respectively, than the conventional tillage in the driest season of 2009/10. In the high rainfall environment of Zidyana EPA (characterized by sandy loam soils), substantial maize yield benefits resulted in the fifth season of experimentation. Farmers spent at most 50 days ha(-1) (US$140) producing maize under CA systems compared with 62 days ha(-1)(US$176) spent under conventional tillage practices. In Lemu, both CA systems resulted in gross margins three times higher than that of the conventional control plot, while in Zidyana, CA monocrop maize and CA maize-legume intercrop resulted in 33 and 23% higher gross margins, respectively, than conventional tillage. In Zidyana, the earthworm population was highest (48 earthworms m(-2) in the first 30 cm) in CA monocrop maize, followed by a CA maize-legume intercropping (40 earthworms) and lowest (nine earthworms) in conventionally tilled treatment. In both study locations CA monocrop maize and CA maize-legume intercrop gave higher water infiltration than the conventional treatment. Improvements in crop productivity, overall economic gain and soil quality have made CA an attractive system for farmers in Malawi and other areas with similar conditions. However, for extensive adoption of CA by smallholder farmers, cultural beliefs that crop production is possible without the ubiquitous ridge and furrow system and residue burning for mice hunting have to be overcome."

Our previous study demonstrated that neighboring maize plants can restrict the spread of soil-borne pathogens of pepper plants by secreting defense compounds into the soil. However, whether maize plant can receive benefits from its neighboring pepper plants in an intercropping system is little attention. We examined the effects of maize roots treated with elicitors from the pepper pathogen Phytophthora capsici and pepper root exudates on the synthesis of 1,4-benzoxazine-3-ones (BXs), the expression of defense-related genes in maize, and their ability to alleviate the severity of southern corn leaf blight (SCLB) caused by Bipolar-1s maydis. We found that SCLB was significantly reduced after the above treatments. The contents of 1,4-benzoxazine-3-ones (BXs: DIBOA, DI MBOA, and MBOA) and the expression levels of BX synthesis and defense genes in maize roots and shoots were up-regulated. DIMBOA and MBOA effectively inhibited the mycelium growth of Bipolaris maydis at physiological concentrations in maize shoots. Further studies suggested that the defense related pathways or genes in maize roots and shoots were activated by elicitors from the P. capsici or pepper root exudates. In conclusion, maize increased the levels of BXs and defense gene expression both in roots and shoots after being triggered by root exudates and pathogen from neighboring pepper plants, eventually enhancing its resistance.

Napier grass borders were planted only on two sides of small-scale farmers' maize fields, since planting of perennial trap crops on all sides of fields hampered mechanical cultivation. C. partellus was the dominant borer species, followed by B. fusca and Sesamia calamistis (Hampson) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Reductions between 0% and 27.4% in the incidence of borer-infested plants were observed on the 16 farms evaluated in this study.

Maize leaves did not support high populations of the pathogen and thus did not seem to provide additional inoculum for the bean crop when the two were grown in association. However, bean leaves in the intercrop system took longer to dry after rainfall and were wetter than those in the monoculture. Simultaneous measurements of parameters related to the pathogen, disease, and weather are therefore needed to understand the effect of a bean/maize intercrop on incidence and severity of disease.

In this paper, APSIM is used to simulate maize yields and soil erosion from traditional open-field farming and hedgerow intercropping in the Philippine uplands. Two variants of open-field farming were simulated using APSIM, continuous and fallow, for comparison with intercropping maize between leguminous shrub hedgerows. Continuous open-field maize farming was predicted to be unsustainable in the long term, while fallow open-field farming was predicted to slow productivity decline by spreading the effect of erosion over a larger cropping area. Hedgerow intercropping was predicted to reduce erosion by maintaining soil surface cover during periods of intense rainfall, contributing to sustainable production of maize in the long term. In the third paper in this series, Nelson et al. (this issue) use cost-benefit analysis to compare the economic viability of hedgerow intercropping relative to traditional open-field farming of maize in relatively inaccessible upland areas.

Opportunities and constraints to legume diversification for sustainable maize production on smallholder farms in Malawi	RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Article						"integrated soil fertility management; smallholder farmer; sustainable intensification"	"BIOLOGICAL NITROGEN-FIXATION; SOIL FERTILITY; CROPPING SYSTEMS; FOOD SECURITY; ACID SOILS; SANDY SOIL; MANAGEMENT; SOUTHERN; TECHNOLOGIES; PIGEONPEA"	"Sustainable intensification of smallholder farms in Africa is highly dependent on enhancing biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). Legume diversification of maize-based systems is a core example of sustainable intensification, with the food security of millions of farm families at stake. This study highlights the constraints and opportunities associated with the adoption of legumes by smallholder farmers in southern Africa. A two-part survey of households and farm fields (n=88) was conducted in the Ekwendeni watershed of northern Malawi. Participatory research and education activities have been underway for over a decade in this region, resulting in expanded uptake of a range of legume species as intercrops and in rotation with the staple maize crop. Farmer adoption has occurred to a varying extent for soybean (Glycine max), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), velvet bean (Mucuna pruriens) and fish bean (Tephrosia vogelii). Farmers, working with the project valued pigeon pea and other legumes for soil fertility purposes to a greater extent than farmers not working with the project. Legumes were valued for a wide range of purposes beyond soil cover and fertility enhancement, notably for infant nutrition (at least for soybean), insect control, and vegetable and grain production for both market and home consumption. Literature values for BNF in tropical legumes range up to 170 kg N ha(-1) for grain and 300 kg N ha(-1) for green manure species; however, our field interviews illustrated the extent of constraints imposed by soil properties on smallholder fields in Malawi. The key edaphic constraints observed were very deficient to moderate phosphorus levels (range 4-142, average 33 mg kg(-1)), and moderately acid soils (range pH 5.1-7.9, average 6.2). The per farm hectarage devoted to legume production relative to maize production was also low (0.15 versus 0.35 ha), a surprising find in an area with demonstrated interest in novel legume species. Further, farmers showed a strong preference for legumes that produced edible grain, regardless of the associated nutrient removal in the harvested grain, and did not sow large areas to legume crops. These farm-level decisions act as constraints to BNF inputs in maize-based smallholder cropping systems. Overall, we found that legume productivity could be enhanced. We documented the value of policies and educational efforts that support farmers gaining access to high-quality seeds, amendments for phosphorus-deficient soils, and promotion of multipurpose legumes that build soils through leafy residues and roots, as well as providing grain for food security and sales."

Replacing bare fallow with cover crops in a maize cropping system: Yield, N uptake and fertiliser fate	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"Fertiliser recovery; Labeled fertiliser; Mediterranean climate; (15)Nitrogen"	"NITROGEN MANAGEMENT; SOIL-MOISTURE; CATCH CROPS; CORN; N-15; RECOVERY; TRACERS; GROWTH; AVAILABILITY; DRAINAGE"	Cover crops in dry regions have been often limited by low nutrient and water-use efficiency. This study was conducted during 3.5 years to determine the effect of replacing bare fallow by a cover crop on yield, N uptake, and fate of labeled fertiliser in an intensive maize production system. Three treatments were studied: barley (Hordeum vulgare L), vetch (Vicia villosa L) and bare fallow during the intercropping period of maize (Zea mays L). All treatments were irrigated and fertilised following the same procedure, and a microplot in each plot was established with 210 kg N ha(-1) of double labeled ammonium nitrate. Crop yield and N uptake, soil mineral N(N-min), and recovery of N-15 in plant and soil were determined after maize harvest and killing the cover crop. Replacing bare fallow with cover crops did not affect subsequent maize yield but affected N uptake. Vetch increased N supply by legume residues after the second year, and the N content in grain by the third. Nitrogen recover from fertiliser was not affected by treatment and averaged 46%. Barley recovered more N-15 during the autumn-winter period than vetch or fallow. Under representative conditions, average barley N content was 47, vetch 51, and spontaneous vegetation content 0.8 kg N ha(-1). Recovery of N-15 in barley comprised 19% of total N content in aerial biomass, while only 4% in vetch. Vetch enhaced soil N-15 recovery more than other treatments, suggesting its presence in a fairly stable organic fraction unavailable for maize uptake or lost. Replacing bare fallow by a cover crop only reduced fertiliser losses in a year with abundant precipitation. Nevertheless, reduction in soil N-min in vetch and bare fallow treatments was similar, showing that N losses can be reduced in this cropping system, either by replace bare fallow with barley or smaller N fertiliser applicationto maize.

Potential application of Hyptis spicigera for biological control of Striga hermonthica infestation	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						"Striga Incidence; seeding rates; cropping systems; maize yield"	"ASIATICA; MAIZE"	Food situation has remained insecure and unpredictable in sub-Saharan Africa leading to high levels of cyclic famine and poverty. This has been exacerbated by perennial pest problems, which cause substantial pre- and post-harvest food grain losses. Production of cereal crops is threatened by Striga hermonthica weed known to infest an estimated 46000 ha of land in the traditional food producing areas in western and coastal Kenya. It is against this background that this study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of Hyptis spicigera-maize cropping systems on S. hermonthica infestation and maize grain yield and, generate a recommendation compatible with the target farmer dormains. Results showed that Striga counts were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced where maize was following fallow with H. spicigera. This was most effective in reducing S. hermonthica incidence and increased maize yield from 2.2 to 3.4 T/Ha. Intercropping maize and H. spicigera in the same plot at the same time negatively affected maize growth resulting in reduced maize yields. Indications were that root cuttings of H. spicigera stimulated Striga seed germination while their stubble (stem and leaves) reduced Striga seed bank in the soil. Striga seed bank analysis showed that Striga seed depletion increased with increase in Hyptis bushes with critical Hyptis seeding rate of 3 kg/Ha for maximum reduction in Striga seed bank. The findings of this study have implications for plant protection against S. hermonthica and improvement of cereal crop production in Striga-prone environments.	"[Othira, J. O.; Onek, L.

Effect of Lablab purpureus and Vicia atropurpuria as an intercrop, or in a crop rotation, on grain and forage yields of maize in Ethiopia	TROPICAL GRASSLANDS			English	Article								following lablab were greater (P < 0.05) than following vicia both as a monoculture and as a simultaneously planted intercrop. When planted as a monoculture or simultaneously planted intercrop with maize, lablab appeared superior to vicia in ternis of its ability to improve both feed supply and soil fertility. The study investigated the effects of maize-annual forage legume associations on maize and fodder production for 4 years in the subhumid zone of western Ethiopia. Lablab purpureus (lablab) and Vicia atropurpuria (vicia) were grown as pure crops or as intercrops in maize at 2 planting dates (simultaneous vs delayed 6 weeks) for 3 consecutive years (1994-1996) and pure maize was planted in all plots in the fourth year (1997). Intercropping significantly (P < 0.05) requeed grain yield in the 3rd year, but its effect on stover yield was not significant (P > 0.05). Among the intercrops, simultaneous planting of lablab Significantly (P < 0.05) reduced grain and stover yield but increased forage dry matter (DM) yield. Lablab resulted in lower (P < 0.05) grain yield and hi-her total fodder (maize stover + forage DM) yield than vicia intercropped simultaneously with maize. Delayed planting, however, did not affect (P > 0.05) grain, stover, forage DM or total fodder yields. Forage yield of lablab was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that of vicia, as both a monoculture and an intercrop planted simultaneously with maize. Plots under lablab and vicia monocultures for the previous 3 years produced maize yields comparable with those on fertilised plots. Among intercrops, the residual effects of simultaneously planted lablab were (P < 0.05) greater than for delayed planting. Grain yields following lablab were greater (P < 0.05) than following vicia both as a monoculture and as a simultaneously planted intercrop. When planted as a monoculture or simultaneously planted intercrop with maize, lablab appeared superior to vicia in terms of its ability to improve both feed supply and soil fertility.

The available S. asiatica control methods include cultural control options such as uprooting and burning the Striga plants before they flower, field sanitation, crop rotation, intercropping, organic matter usage, improved fallows, and application of herbicides. Resource limitation among smallholder farmers renders almost all of the control methods impossible. Development and use of Striga resistant genotypes are seen as the most feasible management option. Marker identification formulates tools that are faster, cheaper, and easier to utilise in breeding for S. asiatica resistance which has low heritability. The objective of this study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for Striga resistance using the genome-wide association study (GWAS). Genotyping by sequencing was done on tropical maize inbred lines followed by their evaluation for Striga resistance. Analysis of variance showed significant (p<0.05) variation among evaluated genotypes for Striga resistance traits such as germination distance, germination percentage, haustoria root attachments, total Striga plants emerged, total biomass, and growth rate. There were also significant differences (p<0.05) for cobs, leaves, stems, and roots weight. The broad sense heritability was fairly high (up to 61%) for most traits. The means for derived traits on stress tolerance indices were subjected to a t-test, and significant differences (p<0.05) were found for leaves, stem, roots, shoots, and total biomass. The Manhattan plots from GWAS showed the presence of three SNP markers on chromosome numbers 5, 6, and 7 for total Striga plants emerged. The identified markers for resistance to S. asiatica should be validated and utilised to breed for Striga resistance in tropical maize.

This paper presents baseline data on the effects of maize-legume inter-crops compared with maize and soyabean sole crops on SOC and nitrogen (N) stocks, gross SOC turnover, soil microbial biomass (SMB), soil organic matter light fraction (LF) and the partitioning of carbon (C) derived from C(3)- and C(4) crops into SOC, LF and SMB. For soil characteristics, only the C:N ratio was significantly different (0-120 cm) between treatments. Gross SOC and SMB-C turnover time (0-120 cm) was faster in the maize sole crop followed by the inter-crops and the soyabean sole crop. The SMB-C and N were significantly greater in the intercrops. Soil LF-N (0-20 cm) was significantly smaller in the inter-crop. Soil became significantly enriched (0-120 cm) in delta 15N in the inter-crop, suggesting that microbial decomposers incorporated C derived from maize and soyabean residues. The greatest proportion of C in the soil and in the soil LF was derived from a C(4)-C source, and the delta 13C of the SMB (0-20 cm) was enriched compared with that of the SOC and the soil LF. Results from this study indicated that after only 1 year of inter-cropping, soil biological and chemical characteristics were influenced positively by this land management practice.

The effects of cutting management on the dry matter (DM) yield, leaf area index (LAI), nodulation, the nitrogen (N) yield, and N fixation by lablab were measured, as were the total DM yield, grain yield, and a yield component of maize. Two dates of lablab cutting (40 and 60 d after sowing (DAS)), and two heights of cutting (30 and 20 cm above the soil surface) were applied in factorial combinations as well as a no-cutting treatment. Maize was not cut either in monoculture or intercrops. Intercropping lablab with maize increased the grain yields of maize from 3.2 t ha(-1) to 3.8 t ha(-1) if lablab was cut at 40 DAS, but delaying cutting until 60 DAS had no effect, while uncut lablab reduced the yield of maize by 10%. Intercropping lablab with maize reduced the total N yield of lablab by over 50%, from 302 to 132 kg N ha(-1). Regardless of cropping system, the total N yield of lablab at 130 DAS was 24% less when lablab was cut at 60 DAS compared with 40 DAS. Cutting height did not significantly affect the total N yield of lablab. Although both cropping system and cutting time significantly affected the total N fixation by lablab at 130 DAS, there were no significant effects of cropping system, cutting time or severity of cutting on the proportion of N in lablab derived from N fixation. Values of Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) which ranged between 1.2 and 1.6, and of Area Time Equivalent Ratio (ATER) which ranged between 1.0 and 1.4 for intercrops of maize with lablab indicated a definite advantage of intercropping. LER and ATER values were greatest: when lablab was uncut, and least when lablab was cut at 60 DAS.

This study evaluated the water competition between pearl millet and cowpea using deuterated water. At vegetative stage, pearl millet biomass production was lower in the pearl millet-cowpea (PM-CP) combination than in the pearl millet-pigeon pea (PM-PP) and pearl millet-bambara nut (PM-BN) combinations. PM-CP used more water than PM-PP and PM-BN under well-watered conditions; however, all combinations used similar amounts of water under dry conditions. The biomass production, photosynthetic rates, transpiration rates, and midday leaf water potential of pearl millet at early flowering stage were not significantly reduced by mixed planting with cowpea sown two weeks later as compared with single planted pearl millet. When pearl millet and cowpea were sown at the same time, mix planting significantly increased the recovery rates of recently irrigated heavy water in pearl millet, but not in cowpea in both vegetative and early flowering stages. Midday leaf water potential and transpiration rates in pearl millet were lowered by mixed planting but those in cowpea were not. These indicate that the water source of pearl millet is shifted to the recently irrigated and easily accessible water. By contrast, when cowpea was sown two weeks later than pearl millet, this trend was not observed. These results provide new evidence on water competition in the PM-CP intercropping system; cowpea has higher ability to acquire existing soil water than pearl millet when both crops are sown at the same time."

R.Wilczek influenced by altitude, nitrogen dose, planting pattern and time of sowing under sole and intercropping with maize	BIOTECHNOLOGIE AGRONOMIE SOCIETE ET ENVIRONNEMENT			English	Article						"Altitude; grain yield; intercropping; nitrogen dose; row pattern"	"DIVERSITY; MOUNTAIN"	"Description of the subject. Mungbean (Vigna radiata [L.] R.Wilczek) is an important summer leguminous crop. It is widely grown in South Asia to fulfill the human nutritious demand of protein, minerals, vitamins and bioactive constituents. It is well suited to be intercropped with cereals in N limited soil to enhance crop productivity through biological nitrogen fixation. Objectives. This paper assesses the impacts of altitude, nitrogen dose, planting pattern and time of sowing on growth and yield parameters of mungbean intercropped with maize in comparison to their sole counterpart. Method. Three-year experiments (2015, 2016 & 2017) were conducted to assess growth and yield performance of mungbean and maize under different environmental conditions and management practices including altitude (1,500; 1,800 and 2,200 m), nitrogen dose (28, 56, 113 kg.ha(-1)), planting pattern (alternate single row and alternate double row), cropping systems (sole and intercropping), and sowing time of intercropping with maize (simultaneous and staggered). Sole plots of maize and mungbean were also established separately. A Randomized Complete Block Design was used with three replicates. Growth and yield components of mungbean i.e., plant height, leaf area per plant, thousands grain weight, grain yield, biological yield and harvest index were measured. Maize plants were sampled at maturity for computing its grain yield. Results. Orthogonal contrast analysis showed a significant variation in plant height due to year and altitude, leaf area per plant due to intercropping, year and altitude, thousands grain weight due to intercropping, planting pattern and time of intercropping with maize, grain yield due to intercropping, year, altitude and planting pattern, biological yield due to year, altitude and planting pattern, and harvest index due to year and altitude. Moreover, intercropping and management practices influenced maize grain yield. Conclusions. Intercropping reduced the growth and yield performance of mungbean compared to monocropping that is attributed to the competition of resources between two crops. However, this interspecific competition has been mollified at lower altitudes when staggered sowing of mungbean intercropped with maize through alternative double row pattern was done. Consequently, in these conditions mungbean growth and yield was improved."

The experiment was carried out during the agricultural years of 2010/2011 and 2011/12, from October 2010 to April 2012, in the Serra do Quilombo, on the Celeiro Farm in Bom Jesus, PI. The design was of randomised blocks in split lots. Soil management systems of conventional tillage and direct planting were evaluated in the lots, and five systems of annual-crop production (soybeans, maize and rice) and cover plants in the sub-lots. Due to the production of phytomass from the overseeding of Urochloa ruziziensis and Pennisetum glaucum in the soybean, and by Urochloa ruziziensis being sown intercropped with the maize, the system of direct planting resulted in significant reductions in the emergence and dry matter accumulation of weeds prevalent in the area (Spermacoce latifolia, Chamesyce hirta, Amaranthus viridis, Digitaria sanguinalis and Cenchrus echinatus).

This study was installed in the northern highlands of Tanzania along the slopes of the highest African peak of Mt. Kilimanjaro with the predominance of smallholder farmers. Cropping seasons (S), cropping systems (C), bean varieties (V), and their interactions were evaluated. Data collected were plant height, ground coverage, total biomass, number of pods per bean and seeds per pod, 100-seed weight, and grain yield. Results indicated that bean in long rainy seasons produced significantly larger grain yields as an effect of S (3.3 t ha(-1)) in 2015, C (3.4 t ha(-1)) in intercrop, V (2.7 t ha(-1)) in local bean, S x C (4.4 t ha(-1)) in 2015 in intercrop, S x V (3.4 t ha(-1)) in improved bean in 2015, C x V (4.6 t ha(-1)) in intercropped local bean, and S x C xV (5.0 t ha(-1)) in intercropped local bean in 2017. In a short rainy season, significantly larger bean grain yield (1.8 t ha(-1)) was recorded as an effect of C when sown subsquent to maize. The effects of V and/or C x V were not significant on bean grain yield during short rainy season. Maize in long rainy seasons produced significantly larger grain yields as an effect of C (2.9 t ha(-1)) but not for S and S x C in rotation with the local bean. In short rainy seasons, significantly larger maize grain yield was produced in 2015 (2.6 t ha(-1)) but the effects of C and S x C were not significant in 2015 and 2016. This study concluded that inclusion of intercrops (of maize and common bean) as part of a rotation with one of these crops significantly improved grain yields and hence provided promising grounds of the options for sustainable food production on smallholder farms.

The experiment was carried out in Rio Branco, in the state of Acre in Brazil, in a plinthic allitic Yellow Argisol. The experimental design used was of complete randomised blocks with split lots and four replications: with the evaluation periods for the lots (March, May, August and October of 2011) and the cover crops for the sublots [tropical kudzu (Pueraria phaseoloides), crotalaria (Crotalaria spectabilis), pinto peanut (Arachis pintoi), jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis) and weeds]. The following were evaluated: respiration (edaphic and basal), microbial biomass, and metabolic (qCO2) and microbial (qMIC) quotients. At the end of the rainy season, under adequate conditions of moisture and oxygenation in the soil, crotalaria cover enhances microbial activity together with the jack bean, which provides better edaphic respiration. During the period when soil oxygen is more restricted (from October to March - the rainy season) and water (August - characteristic of the dry season), the pinto peanut helps maintain high microbial activity. In the period of greatest rainfall (March), the soil under weed cover displays greater microbial biomass and metabolic efficiency.

The objective of this work was to estimate water infiltration rate and soil organic matter content in maize and forage intercropping systems. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with three replications. Five treatments under no-tillage management were evaluated: 1) Corn (Zea mays L.), 2) brachiaria humidicola (Brachiaria humidicola), 3) Corn and brachiaria humidicola intercropping, 4) Aruana grass (Panicum maximum cv. Aruana), 5) Corn and Aruana grass intercropping. The double ring infiltrometer method was used to determine the basic infiltration rate (VIB). Soil physical properties and soil organic matter were evaluated and correlated with VIB values. Results revealed high VIB values for no-tillage. The highest VIB values were observed in the corn treatment. VIB values decreased with the inclusion of forages. All cultivation systems showed a decrease of organic matter with depth.

However, it is still unknown how root development and distribution in inter-cropping responds to aboveground light conditions. Herein, soybeans were inter- and monocropped with P (phosphorus) treatments of 0 and 20 kg P ha yr(-1) (P0 and P20, respectively) in field experiment over 4 years. In 2019, a pot experiment was conducted as the supplement to the field experiment. Shade from sowing to V5 (Five trifoliolates unroll) and light (SL) was used to imitate the light condition of soybeans in a relay trip inter-cropping system, while light then shade from V5 to maturity (LS) was used to imitate the light condition of soybeans when monocropped. Compared to monocropping, P uptake and root distribution in the upper 0-15 cm soil layer increased when inter-cropped. Inter-cropped soybeans suffered serious shade by maize during a common-growth period, which resulted in the inhibition of primary root growth and a modified auxin synthesis center and response. During the solo-existing period, plant photosynthetic capacity and sucrose accumulation increased under ameliorated light in SL (shade-light). Increased light during the reproductive stage significantly decreased leaf P concentration in SL under both P-sufficient and P-deficient conditions. Transcripts of a P starvation response gene (GmPHR25) in leaves and genes (GmEXPB2) involved in root growth were upregulated by ameliorated light during the reproductive stage. Furthermore, during the reproductive stage, more light interception increased the auxin concentration and expression of GmYUCCA14 (encoding the auxin synthesis) and GmTIR1C (auxin receptor) in roots. Across the field and pot experiments, increased lateral root growth and shallower root distribution were associated with inhibited primary root growth during the seedling stage and ameliorated light conditions in the reproductive stage. Consequently, this improved topsoil foraging and P uptake of inter-cropped soybeans. It is suggested that the various light conditions (shade-light) mediating leaf P status and sucrose transport can regulate auxin synthesis and respond to root formation and distribution.

Germination percentage, seedling dry weight, 1000-grain weight, root length and shoot length were used for determining seed quality. Planting pattern had no significant effects on the quality traits. However, germination performance and 1000-grain weight were significantly affected by the interaction of irrigation system x harvest time (P <= 0.01). Maize seeds had higher weight under conventional irrigation at all sampling stages. The same trend of seed weight variation was observed under the two irrigation systems: 1000-grain weight of maize increased along with harvest time and the largest seeds were attained at the last sampling stage. 1000-grain weight, germination, shoot length, root length and seedling dry weight decreased on average by 13, 14, 16, 13 and 14%, respectively. To produce maize seeds with high germination performance and appropriate weight, maize should experience no water shortage during its growth and seed-filling period.

A possible strategy for more efficient management of these pathogens is crop rotation with non-host or nematode-antagonistic plants. The choice of plants to be used in the management of nematodes depends on knowledge of the nematode species that are present in a field and their level of infestation. The aim of this research was to evaluate the occurrence and population density of nematodes and common bean and maize yield in cultivation systems that also included Urochloa ruziziensis. The experiment was installed in a site that was naturally infested with nematodes and conducted for three years under no-tillage. The treatments consisted of cropping systems for production of straw, with maize alone, maize intercropped with U. ruziziensis, and U. ruziziensis alone (summer 2011/2012), alternating with two harvests of common bean (spring 2011 and 2012). The population of nematodes was determined from soil and roots about 80 d after sowing common bean (first and second harvests), and 104 days after sowing maize and U. ruziziensis. Common bean and maize yields were determined by threshing pods and ears contained in the entire plots. The cropping systems that included maize tended to favor population increase of Pratylenchus brachyurus and Meloidogyne incognita and lower yield of common bean. Cultivation of U. ruziziensis alone lowered the population density of P. brachyurus and M. incognita, maintaining higher common bean yield. The cultivation of maize alone or intercropping of maize and U. ruziziensis reduced the population of R. reniformis. Therefore, the inclusion of antagonistic and (or) poor host plants was necessary in these cropping systems to reduce populations of nematodes and maximize the common bean and maize yield.

The intercrops consisted of 40 000, 20 000, and 10 000 maize plants/ha, with a fixed population of 10 000 plants/ha of both cassava and melon. The insecticides were aqueous extracts of ripe seeds of neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss) and the crude seed oil of Piper guineense Schum And Thonn, each at 10% concentration at the rate of 390 litres/ha and 18 litres/ha, respectively. On the plots treated with these natural insecticides, damage by termites [Microtermes spp., Macrotermes bellicosus Smeathman = nigeriensis Sjostedt and M. subhyalinus Rambur (Isoptera: Termitidae)] was significantly lower and maize yields higher than on the control plots. The mean percentage of maize stems attacked by termites (considering all categories of termite damage) in untreated plots during the trials ranged between 0-22 % in 1989 and 2-46 % in 1990. Planting densities did not significantly influence termite attack on maize. Cassava and melon plants or cassava tubers were not attacked by termites in any of the trials and their yields were not affected by insecticide treatments or planting density of maize.

More aboveground biomass, phosphorus accumulation and remobilization contributed to high productivity of intercropping wheat	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION			English	Article						"Wheat/maize relay strip intercropping; Border-row effect; Aboveground biomass; Phosphorus"	"DRY-MATTER; DURUM-WHEAT; INTERSPECIFIC INTERACTIONS; RADIATION INTERCEPTION; YIELD ADVANTAGE; NITROGEN; GROWTH; WHEAT/MAIZE; MAIZE; INTENSIFICATION"	Intercropping often results in increasing production than sole per unit land area, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Plants showed different physiological characteristics in intercropping and sole. However, less information was shown the relationships between plant aboveground biomass (AB), phosphorus accumulation (PB) and remobilization and the yield advantage. Here, field experiments were designed as split plot and carried out in 2012 and 2013 with three P levels (0, 40 and 80 kg P ha(-1)) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/maize (Zea mays L.) relay intercropping and sole. The study measured grain yield, AB and P accumulation and remobilization of wheat. Averaged grain yield of intercropping wheat increased 3.9 Mg ha(-1) in 2012 and 2.7 Mg ha(-1) in 2013 compared with that of the corresponding sole and the grain yield of intercropping wheat changed with the border row (BR) > the inner row (IR) > the sole wheat (SR), the grain yield in BR was contributed by 58.2% to intercropping wheat. The PA was consistent with AB accumulation, which in intercropping was higher than that in sole over the entire growing season. Close correlations between yield and AB remobilization and P remobilization were observed. The yield of BR was higher from 39.3% to 88.0% than that of SR wheat, as mainly attributed to more AB and P accumulation across the whole growing season and more remobilization from pre-anthesis to grain filling stage. More than 40 kg P ha(-1) did not result in any further increasing in yield and did not enhanced the physiological processes associated with AB and P remobilization, indicating that P fertilizer and agronomic management should be intensified synchronously in field to achieve high yield and sustainability.

This study was conducted to test the ability of the CERES soil-process submodels to predict N release from an LCC, prior to growth of a subsequent crop. Field data were collected from 1995 to 1997 following spring incorporation of a mixed stand of woollypod vetch and field pea either early (C/N = 10) or late (C/N = 17) and in unfertilized fallow control plots (no-LCC). Soil temperature and water content by layer were predicted reasonably well with a few exceptions, although temperature errors of even a few degrees may be biologically significant. Inorganic soil N content during the fallow period with no-LCC and after late LCC incorporation was also realistically predicted. With early LCC incorporation, however, the N-transformation submodel substantially underestimated flushes in inorganic soil N immediately after rainfall in 1996 and irrigation in 1997. Second, the nitrification capacity factor, which should simulate a lag between a rapid increase in ammonium concentrations and slower nitrate increase after incorporation of LCC residues, performed poorly. Simulated N dynamics after incorporation of the maize residues (C/N ratio of 80) was also compared with field observations. A measured decrease in inorganic soil N contents was not correctly predicted. These discrepancies indicate the presence of some significant limitations in the soil-process submodels.

Significant differences among populations were found for all characters except end of flowering, period of flowering and pod yield. There were neither cropping system nor populations x cropping system effects for the characters studied. There were significant environment x population interactions in some cases, and this could cause difficulties for future breeding programs. The results suggest that under these environmental conditions, selection under either cropping system would be effective for both.

It was a split plot experiment with three replicates. The BDI system consisted of a 1,300-l tank mounted 1.5 m above ground and connected with a 32-mm mainline and 15-mm lateral lines spaced at 1 m by 0.6 m. A treadle pump was used to uplift water to the tank. Tomato and intercropped maize/bean were irrigated every 4 days. The system reduced labour and water by > 25% and it showed high uniform application depth and wetted diameter. Yields were significantly different between tomato varieties (P < 0.05). Maize/bean yields were highly significantly different between monoculture, intercropping system and bean varieties (P < 0.001). Consequently, an economic analysis shows that there is a significant difference, in terms of net income, between the various crop enterprises. Tomato was more valuable with BDI, compared to maize and beans. It can be concluded that BDI, powered by a treadle pump, saves labour and time and it provides uniform irrigation for crop production.

The experiment was a split-split plot design with three replicates with crop residue management as main plots, cropping systems as sub-plots and nutrient levels as sub-sub plots. Nitrogen was applied in each treatment at two rates (0 and 60 kg N ha(-1)). Phosphorus was applied at 60 kg P/ha in all plots except two intercropped plots. Inorganic fertilizer (N and P) showed significant effects on yields with plots receiving 60 kg P ha(-1) + 60 kg N ha(-1) giving higher yields of 5.23 t ha(-1) compared to control plots whose yields were as low as 1.8 t ha(-1) during the third season. Crop residues had an additive effect on crop production, soil organic carbon and soil total nitrogen. Crop rotation gave higher yields hence an attractive option to farmers. Long-term studies are needed to show the effects of crop residue, cropping systems and nutrient input on sustainability of SOM and crop productivity.	"[Anyanzwa, H.; Okalebo, J. R.; Othieno, C.

In this paper, maize yields simulated with APSIM are used to compare the economic viability of intercropping maize between leguminous shrub hedgerows with that of continuous and fallow open-field farming of maize. The analysis focuses on the economic incentives of upland farmers to adopt hedgerow intercropping, discussing farmers' planning horizons, access to credit and security of land tenure, as well as maize pricing in the Philippines. Insecure land tenure has limited the planning horizons of upland farmers, and high establishment costs reduce the economic viability of hedgerow intercropping relative to continuous and fallow open-field farming in the short term, In the long term, high discount rates and share-tenancy arrangements in which landlords do not contribute to establishment costs reduce the economic viability of hedgerow intercropping relative to fallow open-field farming, (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Intercropping may become more important in a world that needs to produce 60-70% more food by 2050 with limited land and other agricultural resources. To assess the role of intercropping in agricultural systems and its contribution to future food security, an intercrop model is needed for growth and yield predictions of intercrops under different growing conditions. Strip intercropping is a prevalent intercropping system, but the existing intercrop models are generally built for full mixtures and are less suitable for strip intercrops. Here we describe a simple intercrop model which is developed based on a sole crop model using the radiation use efficiency (RUE) concept and a strip intercrop light partitioning module. The model allows simulating the growth and yield of each intercropped species in relay-strip intercropping under potential growing conditions (only competition for light; other resources are assumed to be non-limiting), and the intercrop could vary in species combination, planting configuration, sowing densities and sowing dates. The daily inputs of the model are temperature and radiation, and crop-specific parameters are required to simulate crop leaf area index (LAI), biomass and final yield. Data collected during two years (2013 and 2014) field experiments were used to calibrate and test the model. The experiments consisted of two sole crop treatments (sole wheat, SW and sole maize, SM) and three intercrop treatments (replacement intercrop, 6:2WM and add row intercrops, 8:2WM and 6:3WM). The experiments were conducted in Wageningen, the Netherlands. Data of sole crops (SW and SM) and replacement intercrop (6:2WM) treatment were used to calibrate the model, and data of add-row intercrops (8:2WM and 6:3WM) were used to test the model. Bayesian analysis was applied to calibrate RUE of wheat and maize in sole crops and intercrop. This calibration procedure resulted in posterior distributions of RUE for sole crops and intercrop, on the basis of which distributions of biomass and land equivalent ratio (LER) were simulated. Biomass accumulation and yield of each species were simulated adequately but LAI was slightly overestimated compared to observations. The intercrop model allows simulating the contribution of border row effects to the productivity of inter crops. It combines a simple structure with easy calibration and enables growth and yield simulations for a wide range of relay-strip intercrops. The model thus can be of value in exploratory land use studies to assess the role of intercropping. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Concerns about the sustainability of large-scale, direct-drilled RR-soybeans (Glycine max), and RR-maize (Zea mays) under monoculture in central Argentina are growing steadily. An experiment was conducted during three consecutive years to determine the effects of crops and systems (monocultures and strips) and herbicide strategy on weed density, population rate of change (l), b community diversity (H-), crop yields and Land Equivalent Ratio (LER). Not only crops but also crop systems differentially influenced weed densities along their growth and development. For crop harvests, weed densities increased in both maize crop systems as compared to in the one for soybeans, but the lowest increase occurred in soybean strips. Differences were leveled by both herbicide strategies, which achieved 73% efficacy during the critical periods in both crops. l of annual monocotyledonous increased, thus shifting the weed community composition. Species richness and H- were not affected by crop systems, but both herbicide strategies, particularly POST, either in soybeans in monoculture or in maize strips, significantly enhanced H-. Crop yields significantly increased in the maizestrip system with POST (Year 1) or PRE (Years 2 and 3) strategies, thus increasing LER above 1.

The degradation of land through continuous compaction and decline in the organic matter has resulted in a wide-spread formation of a hardpan that restricts deep percolation, prevents plant root development, and, ultimately can lead to increased erosion. Studies exploring practical low-cost solutions to break the hardpan are limited in Ethiopia. The main objective was to evaluate soil mechanical (i.e. modified plow or Berken plow) or biological intervention (i.e. intercropping with pigeon pea) effectiveness to enhance soil water management and crop yield of rainfed maize systems whilst reducing soil erosion and runoff. Five farm fields, each including four plots with different tillage treatments, were monitored during two rainy seasons in 2016 and 2017. The treatments were: (i) farmers practice under conventional (CT) tillage; plots tilled three times using an oxen driven local plow Maresha, (ii) no-till (NT), (iii) Berken tillage (BT), plots tilled three times using an oxen pulled Berken plow, and (iv) biological (CT + Bio), taprooted pigeon pea intercropped with maize on plots conventionally tilled. Results showed that mean tillage depth was significantly deeper in the BT (28 cm) treatment compared to CT and CT + Bio (18 cm) treatments. Measured soil penetration resistance significantly decreased up to 40 cm depth under BT and maize roots reached 1.5 times deeper compared to roots measured in the CT treatment. Under BT, the estimated water storage in the root zone was estimated at 556 mm, 1.86 times higher compared to CT, 3.11 times higher compared to NT and 0.89 times higher compared to CT + Bio. The positive effects on increased water storage and root development resulted in an average increase in maize grain (i.e. 15%, 0.95 t ha- 1) and residual above ground biomass (0.3%, 6.4 t ha- 1) leading to a positive net benefit of 138 USD ha- 1 for the BT treatment compared to the CT treatment. The negative net benefit obtained under CT and CT+Bio was mainly related to the high labor cost related to plowing, weeding, planting, and fertilizer application whilst in the NT this was related to the significantly lower maize yields. The positive effects in the BT treatment, and to some extent the CT+Bio treatment show great potential for smallholder rainfed maize systems where degraded soils with hardpans and high variability in rainfall prevail."

In this study, a physically based framework is proposed to analyse the competition for soil water in the case of intercropped plants. A radiative transfer model, associated with a transpiration-partitioning model based on a modified form of the Penman-Monteith equation, was used to estimate the evaporative demand of maize (Zea mays L.) and sorghum ( Sorghum vulgare R.) intercrops, In order to model soil-poor water transport, the root water potential of each species was calculated so as to minimise the difference between the evaporative demand and the amount of water taken up by each species. A characterisation of the micrometeorological conditions (net radiation, photosynthetically active radiation, air temperature and humidity, rain), plant water relations (leaf area index, leaf water potential, stomatal conductance, sap flow measurements), as well as the two-component root systems and water balance (soil-root impacts? soil evaporation) was carried out during a 7-day experiment with densities of about 4.2. plant m(-2) for both maize and sorghum. Comparison of the measured and calculated transpiration values shows that the slopes of the measured versus predicted regression lines for hourly transpiration were 0.823 and 0.778 for maize and sorghum, respectively. Overall trends in the variation of volumetric water content profiles are also reasonably well described.

Field based assessment of technologies needs to move beyond production and economic performance to include environment, social and human condition. In this study we systematically consider all five domains of SI based on participatory action research (PAR) initiated in 2012 at three Central Malawi sites that varied in agroecology from low to high potential. Fifteen SI indicators were assessed for four technologies: sole maize (Zea mays L) with 0 and recommended fertilization (69 kg N ha(-1) and 9 kg P ha(-1)), pigeonpea (Cajanus Cajun (L.) Millsp.)-maize intercrop (half rate fertilizer), and doubled up legume rotation (DLR, a pigeonpea-groundnut intercrop) sequenced with maize at half rate fertilizer in that phase. Through radar charts SI performance and tradeoffs were visualized, and causal loop analysis allowed identification of research gaps. SI indicator assessments included crop performance from on-farm trials, profitability, modeled probability of food sufficiency, risk of crop failure and ratings of technologies by women farmers who were engaged in evaluation of technologies through participatory research. The PAR included six mother trials, 236 baby trial farmers and a survey that was carried out with 324 farmers (baby trial farmers plus control farmers) to document socioeconomic factors and management practices on focal fields. Replicated mother trials further provided the basis for simulation modeling (APSIM) of weather-associated crop failure risk and slow processes such as soil carbon (C) accrual. Radar charts were used to visualize SI performance of the technologies. Environmental performance of the two pigeonpea-diversified technologies was variable, but generally high compared with sole maize systems, due to gains in vegetative biomass, duration of cover and biological nitrogen (N) fixation. Maize production and economic assessment varied by site, and with steeper tradeoffs for legume diversification in the mesic site, less so in the marginal site. The domains of social and human capacity building were superior for legume integration, notably in terms of diverse diet, food security and farmer preferences (notably, female farmers generally favored legume crops). Performance varied by site with legume systems most beneficial at the most marginal site, including less risk of crop failure than unfertilized maize. Causal loop analyses identified regulators of SI that require further attention, notably: crop-livestock conflicts and opportunities, male-female control of legume crop production, and residue management. Overall, the SI indicators framework provided a systematic means to consider tradeoffs and opportunities associated with novel crop combinations and management practices.

A meta-analysis	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						"Maize productivity; Labor input; Rain-fed conditions; Smallholder farmers; Soil fertility; Weed management"	"CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE SYSTEMS; CENTRAL RIFT-VALLEY; ECONOMIC-EVALUATION; CROP PRODUCTIVITY; WEED MANAGEMENT; MINIMUM TILLAGE; SOIL FERTILITY; MAIZE; CORN; PROFITABILITY"	Sustainable intensification of agricultural production is needed to ensure increased productivity relative to inputs. Short-term yield returns and labor input are major determinants of the fate of sustainable intensification options on smallholder farms in sub-Saharan Africa because labor shortage is often acute, and most farmers lack access to labor-saving technologies. We assessed the relationship between maize grain yield change and labor input from a total of 28 published papers (631 data pairs) including subsets of data pairs within specific sustainable intensification practices. Among the reviewed technologies, manually dug planting basins showed ratios between the change in yield and change in labor inputs (Y/L) below 1, suggesting that labor demand increased more than yield. In contrast, ridging showed average Y/L values 2. No-till showed high Y/L (average1.7) when combined with herbicides but average Y/L 1 (total labor) when manually weeded. Manually weeded rotations showed average Y/L 1 and manually weeded intercropping systems average Y/L around 1. The relations revealed four scenarios: high yield returns but low labor demand, high yield returns and labor demand, low yield returns and labor demand, and low yield returns but high labor demand. High yield with high labor demand requires mostly investments in machinery and/or herbicides to reduce labor input. Low yield with low labor demand requires improved crop management, whereas low yield with high labor demand requires a combination of improved crop management and investments to reduce labor. This is the first comprehensive assessment showing that the sustainable intensification options being considered for smallholder farmers may increase crop yield but also labor demand. Options that include mechanization and herbicides at low cost are likely to be adopted due to their reduction effect on drudgery and total labor input.	"[Dahlin, A.

This work aims to study the effects of Zea mays L. (maize)/Tagetes minuta L. (tagetes/wild marigold) cropping systems with two spacings on yield, essential oil (EO) quality, and land equivalent ratio. A factorial randomized complete block design was used to perform the analysis with five cropping pattern of maize and wild marigold in ratio 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, 0:100 and two spacing viz., 60 and 90 cm. The findings showed that the single cropping pattern (14,291 kg ha(-1)) produced the maximum biomass yield of T. minuta, followed by 25:75 intercropping ratio of maize: tagetes (10,353 kg ha(-1)). The highest EO yield (37.57 kg ha(-1)) and equivalent yield (48.83 kg ha(-1)) of tagetes were obtained in the intercropping ratio of maize and tagetes of 25:75 and 50:50, respectively, with 60 cm spacing. Furthermore, the quality of EO increased dramatically in intercropping treatments, with the highest amounts of (Z)-beta-ocimene found in the maize and tagetes ratio of 25:75 (43.66 %). The highest value of the land equivalent ratio (LER) was obtained in maize: tagetes (50:50) intercropping pattern with 90 cm spacing (1.22). According to our findings, intercropping wild marigold with maize will increase the quality of T. minuta EO while retaining tagetes yield with minimal efforts; thus, this approach can be regarded as a long-term sustainable management strategy."

Legume crops have been promoted as a key ingredient for SI of rainfed grain production on smallholder farms, with variable results. There is a need to explore the extent to which legume diversification of maize production impacts stability, nutrition, and income. This is particularly so for marginal environments. On-farm experimentation was conducted in Central Malawi over two to seven years on 29 farm sites (120 year-site combinations). The farms were located within four areas that included lakeshore, dissected hills (two locations) and upland plain. Maize diversification included a long-duration legume pigeonpea and a medium duration legume groundnut, grown in rotation or intercropped with maize, and as a doubled-up legume rotation (DLR). To quantify the performance of systems under low, medium, and high yield environments, we used long-term average maize yield to categorize each farm site. All legume diversified systems supported stable grain production in the low yield environment, as shown by 37-41% coefficient of variation for yield, in comparison to 62% for sole maize. The groundnut systems consistently produced the highest grain yield, protein, stable yields, and economic returns, and this performance held up in marginal, low yield environments. In this multi-site, multi-year, on-farm replicated study, the performance of groundnut systems (GnRot and DLR) stood out for high protein (0.529 T ha(-1) 2 yr(-1) and 0.615 T ha(-1) 2 yr(-1), respectively over two years) versus unfertilized maize (0.169 T ha(-1) 2 yr(-1)). These two groundnut-based systems were produced with half-fertilizer rates compared to sole maize and were economically high performers. However, there was a barrier to adoption of GnRot and DLR in that improved groundnut seed was expensive (USD 157 ha(-1) 2 yr(-1)), this initial investment being beyond the means of many farmers, despite the cost largely offset by the generation of high income (USD 1636-1993 ha(-1) 2 yr(-1)). Long-term sustainability was assessed by monitoring soil organic carbon (SOC), which was found to be markedly influenced by soil texture (sites with SOC >1.5% had sand content <50%). Legume diversification effects on SOC were not discerned, possibly due to high sand content on the oldest trial sites. This study highlights the value of longitudinal data and including a wide range of soil texture sites in on-farm experimentation to identify overall legume diversification effects within maize systems.

Effects of cropping systems, maize residues application and N fertilization on promiscuous soybean yields and diversity of native rhizobia in Central Kenya	PEDOBIOLOGIA			English	Article						"Rhizobia; Promiscuous soybean; Diversity; Cropping systems; Crop residues; N fertilizer"	"SOIL FERTILITY MANAGEMENT; MICROBIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; BIOVAR VICIAE POPULATIONS; WEST-AFRICAN SOILS; GENETIC DIVERSITY; BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES; INTERCROPPING SYSTEMS; INDIGENOUS RHIZOBIA; CHEMICAL-PROPERTIES; INOCULANT STRAINS"	Agriculture intensification has resulted in severe soil nutrient depletion in Africa. Alternative agricultural practices have been promoted to reduce the use of expensive mineral fertilizers and to restore and sustain soil fertility. The use of mineral fertilizer combined with organic inputs (such as crop residues) and different cropping systems (cereal-legume association or rotation) have been particularly promising. Impacts of these agricultural practices on soil communities have been widely studied, yet little is known on the effect on more specific groups such as rhizobia. A field trial was set up in Chuka (Kenya) to assess the impact of different cropping systems (maize and soybean in intercropping, rotation or monocropping) combined with N fertilization and residues application on the genetic diversity of promiscuous soybean rhizobia during two seasons. Soybean yields were severely reduced by moisture stress and the association with maize compared to mono-legume and rotation systems. Nodulation was generally low but was positively affected by residues application. Diversity of native rhizobia was very low (Shannon indices H' <0.8) across the experiment and was not affected by the treatments. Only 5 IGS profiles were obtained after RFLP analysis and all isolated rhizobia were identified as Bradyrhizobium elkanii. The distribution of the different IGS groups within the experiment was more affected by season and residues application than by cropping system and nitrogen fertilizer application. These results suggest a limited population and a low diversity of indigenous rhizobia, and emphasize the need of alternative managements to increase and sustain soybean yields in Central Kenya.

Plant-Type on Yield and Photosynthetic Characters of Sweet Potato (Ipomoea balatas L.) in Intercropping System	NOTULAE BOTANICAE HORTI AGROBOTANICI CLUJ-NAPOCA			English	Article						"cultivar collocation; chlorophyll fluorescence; cultivation mode; environmental factors; photosynthetic physiology; reduction rate; shading degree"	"SUCROSE-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE; DIFFERENT SHADE LEVELS; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; DROUGHT STRESS; TUBER YIELD; LIGHT; GROWTH; TEMPERATURE; TROPICS; COWPEA"	Sweet potato/maize relay-cropping mode is considered as the main farming practices of dry land in Southwest China. Although relay-cropping would cause the reduction of fresh tuber yield, it still remained unclear that the reason was shade resulted from maize or genotype of sweet potato. The present work aims at exploring the effects of maize (Zea mays L.) plant-type on photosynthetic physiology and yield of sweet potato (Ipomoea balatas L.) in relay-cropping system. Besides, three plant-types maize cultivars including compact, semi-compact and expanded type were used for relay-cropping with different sweet potato cultivars ('Yushu-2', 'Yushu-6' and 'Nanshu-88') in field. The results showed that the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was declined with the increase of expansion of maize plant-type, which decreased by 77.5%, 80.1% and 82.1% respectively. When relay-cropped with extended maize, the yield reduction rate of sweet potato was the highest (67%). The shade-resistance of different genotype of sweet potatoes was different, and the yield reduction rate of 'Yushu-2' was the lowest (37.01%). Through conducting correlations analysis, it showed that fresh tuber yield had significant positive correlation with Effective Quantum Yield (Y(II)) and significant negative correlation with Non Photochemical Quenching Coefficient (NPQ). In terms of 'Yushu-2', the proportion of heat dissipation was the lowest, and its light quantum efficiency was higher than others. As a result, its reduction rate of yield was lower than the other two. We suggested that compact maize cultivar relay-cropping with strong shade-resistance sweet potato cultivar should be mainly applied in practice of sweet potato.

White lupin (Lupinus albus L. cv. Foedora) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Modena) were cultivated under field conditions in a replacement series experiment with monocultures and mixed cultures with 11 and 33 % white lupin, respectively. Concentrations of elements in shoots of plants were determined with ICP-MS. Mobile concentrations of elements in the rhizosphere soil of white lupin were compared with the corresponding bulk soil. Relative to the monocrops, intercropping of barley with 11 % white lupin significantly increased the amounts of La, Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy and Er as well as the nutrients Fe and Mn in shoots of barley per unit ground area. There were no significant differences in mixed culture effects on the concentrations of REEs in shoots between the different mixing ratios of white lupin/barley, the 11 or 33 % plots, respectively. Increasing the ratio to 33 % white lupin did not further increase amounts of elements in shoots of barley as a result of decreasing yields of barley per unit area. Concentrations of the investigated rare earth elements in shoots of barley were significantly correlated to concentrations of Fe, Mn and P in shoots. Enhanced uptake of the mentioned elements corresponded to a depletion of elements in the rhizosphere soil of white lupin. Mixed cultures with white lupin and barley significantly increased the uptake of REEs as well as the nutrients Fe and Mn in shoots of barley. Rhizosphere processes seem to be responsible for the uptake behavior of the plants, since mixed cultures enhanced the uptake of the investigated elements in barley from REE-containing soil fractions hardly accessible for barley in monoculture.

Input variables for the simulator EPIMUL were manipulated to reflect factors evaluated in 1989-1990 field experiments using a bean-maize intercrop and the bean rust pathogen. The variables were maize interference effects on spore dispersal, maize-bean competition as it affected spore dispersal, and effects of maize on infection efficiency of the rust pathogen after dispersal. When simulations were run at a low rate of disease progress (conditions less than optimal for disease development), intercrops reduced disease to 32% of the monocrop level using 1989 data, but had no effect using 1990 data. Reductions of infection efficiency were largely responsible for lowered disease in 1989-based simulations. Interference and competition effects on dispersal when acting together reduced disease to 81% of the monocrop level using 1989 data, but only affected epidemics in 1990-based simulations when acting independently. Disease alteration due to dispersal effects was caused by changes in spore escape from plots and not changes in the spore dispersal gradient slope. AH treatment effects diminished as the rate of disease progress increased. We have thus identified potential sources of the variability seen in held studies: effects of intercropping may depend highly on rate of disease progress; infection efficiency effects, probably microclimatic, can have a strong impact on disease; and dispersal effects, which may be qualitatively consistent among years, can produce very different epidemics in different years."

In this study, a process-based model, the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere Continuum System (SPACSYS), was used to simulate the effects of different fertilisation regimes on crop yields, the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (SN) stocks from 1990 to 2010, and soil CO2 (2007-2010) and N2O (2007-2008) emissions based on a long-term fertilisation experiment with a winter-wheat (Triticum Aestivum L.) and summer-maize (Zea mays L.) intercropping system in Eutric Cambisol (FAO) soil in southern China. Three fertilisation treatments were 1) unfertilised (Control), 2) chemical nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK), and 3) NPK plus pig manure (NPKM). Statistical analyses indicated that the SPACSYS model can reasonably simulate the yields of wheat and maize, the evolution of SOC and SN stocks and soil CO2 and N2O emissions. The simulations showed that the NPKM treatment had the highest values of crop yields, SOC and SN stocks, and soil CO2 and N2O emissions were the lowest from the Control treatment. Furthermore, the simulated results showed that manure amendment along with chemical fertiliser applications led to both C (1017 +/- 470 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) and N gains (91.7 +/- 15.1 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) in the plant-soil system, while the Control treatment caused a slight loss in C and N. In conclusion, the SPACSYS model can accurately simulate the processes of C and N as affected by various fertilisation treatments in the red soil. Furthermore, application of chemical fertilisers plus manure could be a suitable management for ensuring crop yield and sustaining soil fertility in the red soil region, but the ratio of chemical fertilisers to manure should be optimized to reduce C and N losses to the environment.

The objective of this study was to evaluate production costs and profitability of maize in production systems in Cerrado. The study was conducted in Selviria (Mato Grosso do Sul State), Brazil, in the years 2009/10 and 2010/11. The experiment was arranged in randomized blocks with four replications in factorial and mixed with tracks. We established 36 treatments, three green manures (Pennisetum glaucum, Crotalaria juncea and intercropping Pennisetum glaucum + Crotalaria juncea), three soil management practices (no-tillage system, heavy disking + levelling disking and chisel plow + levelling disking) and four doses of N (0, 60, 90 and 120 kg ha(-1)). For economic analysis were estimated operational cost, the gross revenue obtained by the product of the productivity of the treatments and the value of corn (R$ 0,417 kg or R$ 25,00 sc(-1)) and the ratio revenue / cost of treatment. Whereas higher values (revenue/cost > 1) and lower (revenue/cost ratio < 1) as a parameter in the analysis of profitability, it can be concluded that corn under no-tillage had the highest profitability in succession to Pennisetum glaucum growing profitability with increasing N rates, in succession to Crotalaria juncea and in the absence of nitrogen application on the coverage achieved higher profitability compared to other treatments and in succession to the consortium Pennisetum glaucum + Crotalaria juncea doses of N was between 50 and 55 kg ha(-1) offer greater profitability to the cultivation of corn.

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that intercropping (common bean -maize) in P -deficient soil can enhance the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks from the microbial biomass (MB). The field experiment was conducted in Setif province in a northern Algerian agroecosystem with a Mediterranean climate. The nodule N storage in intercropped common bean was 60% higher than for sole crops and was highest in a P -deficient soil in the second year. The carbon stock from the microbial biomass of the soil (MBC) was higher with intercropping than for sole crops and fallow and was even higher in P-deficient (23%) soils as compared to P sufficient (17%) conditions. There was a strong correlation between C stock from nodule (NC) and MBC stock for intercropping in either P deficient (r(2) = 0.80***; p < 0.001) or P-sufficient soils (r(2) = 0.69**; p < 0.01). P -deficient conditions gave the highest total soil respiration (1.68 g C-CO2 111(-2) days(-1)) and the lowest MB C:N ratio (10.3 and 12.2 for common bean and maize, respectively) in intercrops system. This study showed that, in a P -deficient soil, intercropping is a good solution for increasing the rhizosphere MB through C and N partitioning between root nodules and rhizosphere microbial community, which is responsible for improving soil fertility and recycle mineral elements.

We evaluated, over three cropping seasons, conservation agriculture (reduced tillage and mulching) and farmer prioritized conventional tillage- and mulching-based options on seasonal soil water retention, and subsequent productivity of maize (Zea mays L.) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata Walp L.) in mono- and inter-crops in Eastern Zimbabwe. The experiments were established on sand and clay soils. The first cropping season (2014/15) received evenly distributed rainfall (hereinafter referred to as 'wetter'), while the two succeeding seasons (2015/16 and 2016/17) had high incidences of intra-seasonal dry spells (hereinafter referred to as 'drier'). Overall, conventional tillage had 10-31% and 27-40% more moisture than conservation agriculture treatments on sand and clay soils, respectively. Soil moisture was most retained in intercrop under mulch-based conventional tillage. Maize grain yield during the 'wetter' season on sand soil was highest and least (P > 0.05) in intercrop under conservation agriculture (2.3 Mg ha(-1)) and mulch-based conventional tillage (1 Mg ha(-1)), respectively. On clay soil, intercrop under mulch-based conventional tillage (2.4 Mg ha(-1)) yielded the best. During the 'drier' seasons, intercrop under mulch-based conventional tillage achieved the best maize grain yield on both sand (1.5 Mg ha(-1)) and clay (1.4 Mg ha(-1)) soils. Mulching increased maize grain yield by 55-90% during the 'drier' seasons, but reduced water use efficiency (WUE) by approximately 15% during the 'wetter' season. Over the three seasons, cowpea grain yield did not exceed 1 Mg ha(-1) in both mono- and inter-crops. The study revealed contrasting short-term effects of soil water management options on soil moisture retention and intercropping productivity as dictated by seasonal rainfall variability and soil type. These findings point to the need for tillage and mulching typologies across soil types to minimize negative effects of rainfall variability on crop productivity.

Significant treatment effects were observed in plant height and leaf area of maize and okra whereas stem girth was not significantly affected in either crop. The percentage leaf P concentration of maize, okra and cowpea were significantly (P < 0.05) affected by treatment application. The percentage ranged from 0.18 - 0.48 and 0.24 - 0.45 in maize, 0.20 - 0.39% and 0.21 - 0.40% in okra and 0.16 - 0.40 and 0.18 - 0.42% in cowpea in 2002 and 2003, respectively. Increase in available P in amended ORP over sole ORP ranged from 44 - 71%, 40 - 71%, and 50 - 67% in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th sampling period. The ORP + 4 t/ha CD gave the highest P content of leaf in all the crops and in both years. The complementary use of Ogun rock phosphate with 3 t ha(-1) cow dung manure produced the highest yields of maize (3.2 and 2.3 t ha(-1)), okra (1.6 and 2.5 t ha(-1)), and cowpea (1.8 and 1.9 t ha(-1)) in 2002 and 2003, respectively.

The aim of this experiment was to evaluate Cd, Pb, Zn, and Cu sorption characteristics of three soils and their influence on the comparative effectiveness of EDTA and legume intercrop on the remediative abilities of maize, mucuna, okra, and kenaf. The sorption studies were done using standard procedures. The EDTA-assisted phytoextraction (6mmol kg(-1)) and the cowpea intercrop trials were conducted in triplicate. The metal-spiked soils were planted with maize, kenaf, and mucuna in the EDTA trial and maize, kenaf, and okra were planted in the cowpea intercrop experiment. Cadmium was prefentially sorbed in acid and alkaline soils and Cu in slightly acid soil. Cadmium uptake was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in all the plants. Bioconcentration factors of Pb, Cu, and Zn were higher (P < 0.05) in maize compared with other plants. Phytoremediative ability of the plants in trials were maize > kenaf > mucuna and okra > maize > kenaf, respectively. It was concluded that a legume intercrop can substitute EDTA- assisted phytoextraction to prevent groundwater contamination resulting from high solubility of metals by EDTA.

"Traditional crop species are reported to be drought-tolerant and nutrient-dense with potential to contribute to sustainable food and nutrition security within marginal production systems under climate change. We hypothesized that intercropping maize landraces (Zea mays L.) with bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc.), together with optimum management strategies, can improve productivity and water use efficiency (WUE) under climate change. Using an ex-ante approach, we assessed climate change impacts and agronomic management options, such as plant ratios, and plant sequences, on yield and WUE of intercropped maize landrace and bambara groundnut. The Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model was applied over four time periods; namely past (1961-1991), present (1995-2025), mid-century (2030-2060) and late-century (2065-2095), obtained from six GCMs. Across timescales, there were no significant differences with mean annual rainfall, but late century projections of mean annual temperature and reference crop evaporation (ET0) showed average increases of 3.5 degrees C and 155 mm, respectively. By late century and relative to the present, the projected changes in yield and WUE were -10 and -15% and 5 and 7% for intercropped bambara groundnut and maize landrace, respectively. Regardless of timescale, increasing plant population improved yield and WUE of intercropped bambara groundnut. Asynchronous planting increased yield and WUE for both maize landrace (5 and 14%) and bambara groundnut (35 and 47%, respectively). Most significant improvements were observed when either crop was planted 2-3 months apart. To reduce yield gaps in intercrop systems, low-cost management options like changing plant populations and sequential cropping can increase yield and WUE under projected climate change. To further increase sustainability, there is a need to expand the research to consider other management strategies such as use of other traditional crop species, fertilization, rainwater harvesting and soil conservation techniques."

N-2-fixation and N contribution by grain legumes under different soil fertility status and cropping systems in the Guinea savanna of northern Ghana	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"Cowpea; Soybean; Groundnut; Maize; Partial N balance"	"UPPER WEST REGION; N-2 FIXATION; NITROGEN-FIXATION; USE EFFICIENCY; RESOURCE USE; MAIZE; COWPEA; BALANCE; ENVIRONMENTS; PRODUCTIVITY"	"Continuous cereal-based cropping has led to a rapid decline in soil fertility in the Guinea savanna agro-ecological zone of northern Ghana with corresponding low crop yields. We evaluated the effects of cropping system and soil fertility status on grain yields and N-2-fixation by grain legumes and net N contribution to soil fertility improvement in contrasting sites in this agro-ecological zone. Maize was intercropped with cowpea, soybean and groundnut within a row, with a maize stand alternated with two equally spaced cowpea or groundnut stands and in the maize-soybean system, four equally spaced soybean stands. These intercrops were compared with sole crops of maize, cowpea, soybean and groundnut in fertile and poorly fertile fields at sites in the southern (SGS) and the northern (NGS) Guinea savanna. The proportion of N derived from N-2-fixation (%Ndfa) was comparable between intercrops and sole crops. However, the amount of N-2-fixed was significantly larger in sole crops due to a greater biomass accumulation. Legumes in poorly fertile fields had significantly smaller shoot 815N enrichment (-2.8 to +0.7%o) and a larger %Ndfa (55-94%) than those in fertile fields (-0.8 to + 2.2%o; 23-85%). The N-2 fixed however was larger in fertile fields (16-145 kg N ha(-1)) than in poorly fertile fields (15-123 kg N ha(-1)) due to greater shoot dry matter and N yields. The legumes grown in the NGS obtained more of their N requirements from atmospheric N-2-fixation (73-88%) than legumes grown in the SGS (41-69%). The partial soil N balance (in kg ha(-1)) was comparable between intercrops (-14 to 21) and sole legumes (-8 to 23) but smaller than that of sole maize receiving N fertiliser (+ 7 to + 34). With other N inputs (aerial deposition) and outputs (leaching and gaseous losses) unaccounted for, there is uncertainty surrounding the actual amount of soil N balances of the cropping systems, indicating that partial N balances are not reliable indicators of the sustain ability of cropping systems. Nevertheless, the systems with legumes seem more attractive due to several non-N benefits. Our results suggest that soybean could be targeted in the SGS and cowpea in the NGS for greater productivity while groundnut is suited to both environments. Grain legumes grown in poorly fertile fields contributed more net N to the soil but growing legumes in fertile fields seems more lucrative due to greater grain and stover yields and non-N benefits."

The objective of this research was to test the hypothesis that intercropping with greater plant richness produces more roots that improves microbial activity, which in turn, contributes to soil physical structure that improves soil chemistry parameters, crop yield, and land use. We performed a field experiment in a randomized block design, utilizing beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), maize (Zea mays), and eggplant (Solanum melongena), under monoculture or intercropping systems. Root and soil biological, physical and chemical parameters, crop yield and land equivalent ratios were analyzed. Increased plant richness as a function of the intercropping system did not affect root and soil parameters. However, principal component analysis indicated that intercropping affected root density, mass, and length, which, in turn, contributed to the formation of soil aggregates, increased microbial activity and to the improvement of soil chemical parameters. Furthermore, as consequence of increased plant richness, the maize-beans-eggplant intercropping facilitated the positive interactions among the species and led to a Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) 60% higher than the monoculture systems. The production of roots in the crop systems, regardless of species richness, stimulates soil biological activity and affects the quality of physical structure and fertility indicators of the soil. Crop systems with higher richness of plant species promote positive interactions between plants and soil and results in a better land use ratio.

Whenever possible, parameters for the model were determined from measured or standard values for the environment of the field trials, while other parameters were derived from previous modelling experience in tropical environments. The remaining parameters were derived using step-wise calibration, where one or two parameters were calibrated against closely related measured data. Once parameterised, APSIM gave acceptable predictions of maize yields and soil loss from open-field farming and hedgerow intercropping. The version of APSIM described in this paper is used to simulate maize yields and soil erosion from open-field farming and hedgerow intercropping in the second paper in this series (Nelson et al., this issue). In the third paper, Nelson et al. (this issue) use cost-benefit analysis to compare the economic viability of hedgerow intercropping relative to traditional open-field farming of maize in relatively inaccessible upland areas.

Mortality caused by mycosis was significantly higher in cowpea intercrop than in the monocrop. Flower and pod production were significantly higher within the intercrop treated with M. anisopliae than in the monocrop also treated with fungus. In both seasons, grain yields in the cowpea intercrop treated with M. anisopliae did not differ from yields within cowpea intercrop treated with Karate (Lambda-cyhalothrin). M. anisopliae had no adverse effect on populations of nontarget organisms. Our results suggest that hi. anisopliae is a promising candidate for the management of M. sjostedti, especially within a cowpea/maize intercropping systems.

SOIL-TEMPERATURE IN RELATION TO LEAF-AREA VARIATION	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article							"MOISTURE; NIGERIA; YIELD"	Afternoon soil temperature of about 39-degrees-C observed at 5 cm depth under sole cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) early in the growing season was reduced by respectively 1.0, 1.3, 3.0 and 4.4-degrees-C by intercropping with maize (Zea mays L.), maize/okra (Abelmoschus esculentus Moench), maize/egusi melon (Citrullus lanatus Thunb.), and maize/okra/egusi melon. There was a negative but significant relationship between soil temperature and combined leaf area index (L) of crops grown in mixture with sparse-canopy cassava (r = -0.91**) and with dense-canopy cassava (r = -0.93**). This work has shown that, for effective soil temperature reduction under cassava, associated inter-crops must attain L of at least 1.5 within the first eight weeks of growth. Since the L of cassava is below 0.5 during the first eight weeks of growth, intercrops such as egusi melon and maize would help in reducing supra-optimal temperatures under cassava.

Within-field spatial distribution patterns of corn planthopper, Peregrinus maidis, and severity of hopperburn and Maize mosaic virus symptoms as influenced by sunn hemp intercropping	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA			English	Article						"habitat management; spatial pattern; aggregation; Hemiptera; Delphacidae; Poaceae; Fabaceae; Rhabdoviridae; MMV"	"THYSANOPTERA THRIPIDAE; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; OILSEED RAPE; COUNT DATA; DYNAMICS; DELPHACIDAE; HOMOPTERA; DISEASE; PLANTS; PENTATOMIDAE"	Habitat management (e.g., intercropping) may alter within-field spatial distribution patterns of herbivores, from a typical pattern as observed in a monoculture, and may influence patterns of crop injury. Field trials were conducted to study the effect of intercropping maize, Zea mays L. (Poaceae), with sunn hemp, Crotalaria juncea L. (Fabaceae) strips on within-field spatial distribution patterns of corn planthopper, Peregrinus maidis (Ashmead) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), and combined severity of hopperburn and Maize mosaic virus (MMV) (Rhabdoviridae: Nucleorhabdovirus) symptoms. In each field trial, spatially explicit data on P.maidis counts and ratings of severity of symptoms were obtained by sampling maize plants at weekly intervals. These data were used to examine the spatial patterns of P.maidis and severity of symptoms in maize-intercropped and monoculture plots with Spatial Analysis for Distance IndicEs (SADIE) methodology. Spatial aggregation patterns of P.maidis in each treatment plot were not consistent among the field trials and tended to be mediated by their population densities. Interpolation of local cluster indices showed that P.maidis were more often aggregated at the field edges, irrespective of treatment. At times of MMV incidence in field trials (fall 2010 and spring 2011), the patch clusters of P.maidis and symptomatic plants were located at the field edges, but were spatially unassociated in both treatment plots. The results provided an approximation of the unpredictability of P.maidis spatial patterns at different population densities and their association with severity of symptoms in two maize-cropping systems. However, the gap clusters of symptomatic plants were primarily located at the field interiors and were larger in intercropped than in monoculture plots. Such spatial pattern of symptomatic plants resulted in the reduced incidence of MMV in the intercropped plot compared with the monoculture plot, suggesting intercropping sunn hemp can be a useful tool in the management of MMV in maize fields.

Area of study: A subtropical area in Southern Brazil. Material and methods: The experiment was implemented in 2013. The treatments were: seven winter cover crops single cultivated (white-oats, black-oats, annual-ryegrass, canola, vetch, fodder-radish and red-clover); an intercropping (black-oats + vetch); and a fallow, with maize in succession. Soil samples were collected after four years of experimentation, up to 0.60 m depth, for SOC determination. Main results: SOC stocks at 0-0.6 m depth ranged from 96.2 to 107.8 t/ha. The SOC stocks (0-0.60 m depth) were higher under vetch and black-oats, with an expressive increase of 23 and 20% for C stocks in the 0.45-0.60 m layer, compared to fallow. Thus, SOC sequestration rates (0-0.60 m depth), with vetch and black oats, were 1.68 and 0.93 t/ha.yr, respectively. Research highlights: The establishment of a high-quality and high C input cover crops in the winter, as vetch or black-oats in succession to maize, are able to increase SOC stocks, even in the short term."

J	Olasantan, FO				Olasantan, FO			Optimum plant populations for okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) in a mixture with cassava (Manihot esculenta) and its relevance to rainy season-based cropping systems in south-western Nigeria	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article							"MAIZE ZEA-MAYS; WEED-CONTROL; GROUNDNUT; DENSITY; COWPEA; YIELD"	Experiments were conducted in Nigeria to evaluate the optimum plant population density for okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) sown in monoculture or intercropped with cassava (Manilhot esculenta). The crops were sown as late and early season crops in 1997 and 1998. Okra was sown at varied spacings to achieve final plant densities of 25000, 35000 and 50000 plants/ha in both monoculture and mixed stands. Intercropping had no significant effect on okra phenology (time to vegetative growth, flowering and fruiting). However, it significantly reduced weed growth by 25-45 % and nematode infection in okra by 36 %, and kept the canopy environment of cassava cooler by 3.0-4.4 degreesC and more moist by 5-10 g/kg, compared with monoculture. The durations of vegetative and reproductive growth and the weed-control ability of okra in both cropping systems were influenced by population density. Okra sown at 50000 plants/ha took the longest time to reach specific phenological stages, controlled weeds best and gave the highest fresh pod yields in both seasons. There was little increase in pod yields between 35000 and 50000 plants/ha in mixed stands in late season sown crops. The growth and tuber yield of cassava were not significantly affected by intercropping and okra population density. The growth of okra and cassava were better with early than late season sowing, irrespective of okra population density or cropping system. This appears to have been due mainly to the effect of temperature and rainfall differences between the seasons. The substantial variation in the weather during the two seasons also had greater effect in monoculture than mixed stands. It is concluded that when rainfall is limiting, okra could be intercropped with cassava using population density up to 35 000 plants/ha to allow the vegetable to develop and to maximize pod yield under the relatively dry conditions. The optimum target suggested is 50000-60000 plants/ha during the wet periods.

From a sample of 62 FF, we first estimate a model of Data Envelopment Analysis with constant and variable returns to scale, then a censored TOBIT model enabling therefore to identify factors of efficiency. Two main outcomes result from this study. First of all, we can see that on average, the level of technical efficiency of FFs is 44.60% when returns to scale are constant, and 67.80% when return to scale are variable. This shows off possibilities of efficiency substantial gains. Secondly, the farm size and the production destination impact negatively on the technical efficiency. Finally, the adherence to a peasant organisation and age improve it. From those results, we estimate that if one wants to improve the efficiency of the FFs, it would be interesting that the FFs organise themselves into associations in order to benefit from experience sharing, and government and nongovernmental organisations (NGO).

The model and its parameter values were taken from previous applications of the model to pure swards of grass and red clover grown in the same experiment at the same sites and years. The field data used comprised above-ground dry matter production and proportion of clover in a mixture of red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.) in two seasonal growth cycles during two consecutive years, sampled at six sites in Central and Southern Sweden. On average for all fields, the proportion of clover decreased with increased nitrogen application. It increased from the first to the second cut, but decreased from the first to the second year. The model most often underestimated above-ground biomass when using proportion of clover and estimates of radiation use efficiency (epsilon) and root allocation fraction (b(r)) from values in the pure stands (Method 1). This discrepancy suggested that epsilon might be higher for the mixed stand than the pure stands. Values of e and br for the mixed stands were therefore derived by calibration to the observed above-ground biomass (Method 2). The radiation use efficiency (epsilon) of the mixed stand was on average 6% higher than estimates of epsilon from pure stand values and proportion of clover. Overall, the variation in radiation use efficiency of mixed stands due to cutting and year was similar to that of pure stands of grass and clover, whereas the relationship to N treatment was weak and more similar to that of clover. The explanation that variations in biomass production were due to changes in root allocation seems reasonable. No variations in radiation use efficiency or root allocation fraction could be related to the proportion of clover. The variations due to cutting and year overwhelmed any such effect.

In this study, tea plants were intercropped with maize in two planting directions from east to west (i.e., south shading (SS)) and from north to south (i.e., east shading (ES) and west shading (WS)) to form ecological shading, and the effects on tea quality, and the population occurrence and community diversity of insect pests and soil microbes were studied. When compared with the non-shading control, the tea foliar nutrition contents of free fatty acids have been significantly affected by the ecological shading. SS, ES, and WS all significantly increased the foliar content of theanine and caffeine and the catechin quality index in the leaves of tea plants, simultaneously significantly reducing the foliar content of total polyphenols and the phenol/ammonia ratio. Moreover, ES and WS both significantly reduced the population occurrences of Empoasca onukii and Trialeurodes vaporariorum.

The weed seedbank and annual recruitment are the main sources of weed infestation in crops. This study was carried out in Ibadan, Nigeria, to evaluate the effect on the seedbank of two types of planted fallow (alley cropping with leucaena and live mulch with tropical kudzu) and a natural bush fallow under four land-use intensities. Type of fallow was the main plot. Land-use intensities, consisting of continuous cropping of maize intercropped with cassava, 1 cropping yr of maize-cassava followed by 1, 2, and 3 yr of fallow, were the subplots. Averaged over a 3-yr period, the seedbank was 55% lower in the tropical kudzu plots and 43% lower in the leucaena plots compared with natural bush. The difference in seedbanks between plots cultivated after leucaena and natural fallow was 23%. Seed density of annual broadleaf weeds was high and dominated the seedbank of both planted and natural fallow. Overall, seeds of grasses occurred at low densities in all plots cultivated after 2 to 3 yr of fallow, whereas seeds of sedges occurred more in continuously cultivated plots and plots cultivated after 1 yr of fallow in all the fallow types. Seed density of perennial broadleaf weeds increased as land-use intensity decreased. Live mulch with tropical kudzu, especially when combined with 2 to 3 yr of fallow, lowered the seedbank more than the leucaena and traditional bush fallow systems.

To elucidate the pathogenesis mechanism of F. graminearum on intercropped soybean which causes root rot, transcriptional profiling of F. graminearum at 12, 24, and 48 h post-inoculation (hpi) on soybean hypocotyl tissues was conducted. In total, 2313 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of F. graminearum were annotated by both KEGG pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. Among them, 128 DEGs were commonly expressed at three inoculation time points while the maximum DEGs were induced at 24 hpi. In addition, DEGs were also rich in carbon metabolism, ribosome and peroxisome pathways which might contribute to carbon source utilization, sexual reproduction, virulence and survival of F. graminearum when infected on soybean. Hence, this study will provide some basis for the deep understanding the pathogenesis mechanism of F. graminearum on different hosts and its effective control in maize-soybean strip relay intercropping systems.

This study examined smallholder farmers' adaptation strategies to mitigate the effects of drought on maize production in OR Tambo District in South Africa. A questionnaire was used to collect primary data from 200 farmers, which was then analyzed using descriptive statistics, the adaptation strategy index and the double hurdle model. The study utilized the adaptation strategy index to establish the relationship between adopting adaptation strategies and maize production. The farmers ranked the adaptation strategies in terms of their usefulness in adapting to drought and successfully alleviating a decline in maize production. The farmers ranked shifting of planting date, reduction of maize cultivated area, planting drought resistant varieties, crop diversification and intercropping as the most useful adaptation strategies. The study utilized the double hurdle model to identify the factors affecting the farmers' adoption of drought adaptation strategies. The study found that gender of the household head, level of education of the household head, household size, extension services and land ownership influence farmers' choice of adaptation strategies. Training of woman who head households and poor farmers on climate change adaption strategies options available is necessary.

J	"Udoh, AJ; Ndaeyo, NU"				"Udoh, AJ; Ndaeyo, NU"			Crop productivity and land use efficiency in cassava-maize system as influenced by cowpea and melon populations	TROPICAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article						"cropping system; cowpea and melon population; land use efficiency; crop productivity"	ZEA-MAYS	A three-year (1989-91) field study was conducted to assess the effect of cowpea-melon populations on crop productivity and land equivalent ratios (LERs) in a cassava-maize system in Uyo, south-eastern Nigeria. A split-plot design replicated thrice was used, Cropping systems constituted the main plot and crop populations the sub-plots. Cassava and maize were planted at populations of 10 x 10(3) plants and 20 x 10(3) plants ha(-1), respectively, cowpea at 20, 33, and 50 x 10(3) plants ha(-1), and melon at 5, 10, and 15 x 10(3) plants ha(-1). A higher number of cassava storage roots per plant and fresh root yield, number of maize grain seed per cob, and grain yield in the intercrop were produced at the low cowpea population (20 x 10(3) plants ha(-1)) than at the higher populations. However, cowpea and melon populations showed no significant effect on cassava and maize harvest indices irrespective of the season of planting. Intercropping generally reduced the number of cowpea pods by 35% and also the number of seeds per pod. Melon pod number per plant and seed number per pod were significantly (P < 0.05) affected by intercropping. Cowpea grain and melon seed yields increased with increase in populations. As in cassava and maize, cowpea and melon indices were not affected by cowpea and melon populations. Grain yield and seed yield components of cowpea and melon were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the sole crop due to the absence of competition from companion crops, The cassava + maize + cowpea + melon system resulted in the highest LERs of 2.29, 2.62, and 3.12 in 1989, 1990, and 1991, respectively, due to the low population combination of 20000 cowpea plants with 5000-10000 melon plants ha(-1). The lowest LERs (2.19, 2,12, and 2.31 for the three respective years) were obtained from the highest population combinations of 50000 cowpea plants and 15000 melon plants ha(-1). This suggested an effectively-balanced competition among the crop species leading to 37-63%, 41-49%, and 26-70% greater LER for 1989, 1990, and 1991, respectively, than if the crops were grown sole. This LER is of utmost significance for the study area where the available arable land is seriously being threatened by rapid urbanization and increased production density.

Yield and water use efficiencies of maize and cowpea as affected by tillage and cropping systems in semi-arid Eastern Kenya	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Article						"Plant available water; Soil water depletion; Rainfall distribution; Yield and water use efficiency"	"SOIL; CONSERVATION; PRODUCTIVITY; STRATEGIES; STORAGE"	Soil water conservation through tillage is widely accepted as one of the ways of improving crop yields in rainfed agriculture. Field experiments were conducted between 2007 and 2009 to evaluate the effects of conservation tillage on the yields and crop water use efficiency of maize (Zea mays L) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L) in eastern Kenya. Experimental treatments were a combination of three tillage practices and four cropping systems. Tillage practices were tied-ridges, subsoiling-ripping and ox-ploughing. The cropping systems were single crop maize, single crop cowpea, intercropped maize-cowpea and single crop maize with manure. The treatments were arranged in split plots with tillage practices as the main plots and cropping systems as the sub-plots in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD). The results showed that tied-ridge tillage had the greatest plant available water content while subsoiling-ripping tillage had the least in all seasons. Averaged across seasons and cropping season, tillage did not have a significant effects on maize grain yield but it did have a significant effect on crop grain and dry matter water use efficiency (WUE). Nevertheless, maize grain yields and WUE values were generally greater under tied-ridge tillage than under subsoiling-ripping and ox-plough tillages. The yields and WUE of cowpea under subsoiling-ripping tillage were less than those of ox-plough tillage. When averaged across the seasons and tillage systems, the cropping system with the manure treatment increased (P <= 0.05) maize grain yield, grain WUE and dry matter WUE by 36%, 30%, 26% respectively, compared to treatments without manure. Maize and cowpea when intercropped under ox-plough and ripping tillage systems did not have any yield advantage over the single crop. (C) 2012 Elsevier BM. All right's reserved.	"[Miriti, J.

Intercropping of sesbania/sorghum showed a greater efficiency than monocropping in producing dry matter during the entire growth period, whereas the efficiency of producing dry matter in the sesbania/sunflower intercropping was similar to that in the monocropping system. Moreover, sorghum plants (C4) were more competitive than sesbania (C3) for soil N uptake, whereas sesbania seemed to be more competitive than its associated sunflower (C3). Nitrogen uptake in the mixed stand of sesbania/sorghum was improved as a result of the increase in soil N uptake by the component sorghum and the greater root nodule activity of component sesbania without affecting the amount of N2 fixed.

Nitrogen retained in the cover crop biomass left over the soil reduces soil N availability, which might enhance the N fertiliser use efficiency of the subsequent cash crop and the risk of depressive yield and pre-emptive competition. The main goal of this study was to determine the cover crop effect on crop yield, N use efficiency and fertiliser recovery in a 2-year study included in a long-term (10 years) maize/cover crop production system. Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and vetch (Vicia sativa L), as cover crops, were compared with a fallow treatment during the maize intercropping period. All treatments were cropped following the same procedure, including 130 kg N ha(-1) with N-15 fertiliser. The N rate was reduced from the recommended N rate based on previous results, to enhance the cover crop effect. Crop yield and N uptake, soil N mineral and N-15 fertiliser recovered in plants and the soil were determined at different times. The cover crops behaved differently: the barley covered the ground faster, while the vetch attained a larger coverage and N content before being killed. Maize yield and biomass were not affected by the treatments. Maize N uptake was larger after vetch than after barley, while fallow treatment provided intermediate results. This result can be ascribed to N mineralization of vetch residues, which results in an increased N use efficiency of maize. All treatments showed low soil N availability after the maize harvest; however, barley also reduced the N in the upper layers before maize planting, increasing the risk of pre-emptive competition. In addition to the year-long effect of residue decomposition, there was a cumulative effect on the soil's capacity to supply N after 7 years of cover cropping, larger for the vetch than for the barley.

Effects of replacing grass silage harvested at two maturity stages with maize silage in the ration upon the intake, digestibility and N retention in wether sheep	LIVESTOCK SCIENCE			English	Article						"grass silage; maize silage; intake; digestibility; N retention"	"MICROBIAL-GROWTH; FEED-INTAKE; CORN GRAIN; NITROGEN; DIGESTION; COMBINATIONS; PERFORMANCE; INTERCROPS; QUALITY; ENERGY"	The objective of this experiment was to study the effects of interactions between medium quality grass silage (GS 1) and maize silage (MS) as well as between low-quality grass silage (GS2) and MS on ad libitum intake, digestibility and N retention in wether sheep. Two grass silages (GS 1 and GS2) were ensiled in round bales, without additives, from the primary growth of orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata L.) harvested at two different maturity stages. The study consisted of seven feeding treatments incorporating GS1, GS2 and MS fed alone and forage mixtures of GS1 and MS as well as GS2 and MS (67:33% and 33:67%, respectively, DM (dry matter) basis). Delayed harvesting lowered (P < 0.05) the crude protein (CP) concentration in GS2 compared to GS1. The DM content (g kg(-1) fresh sample) and starch concentration (g kg(-1) DM) of MS were 264 and 211, respectively. Inclusion of MS in the GS1-based ration had positive linear effects on CP and starch digestibility (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively) and N intake (P < 0.01) while a negative effect on neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) digestibility (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). A positive associative response of GS1 and MS was observed for DM ad libitum intake (g kg(-1) M-0.75 day(-1)) (quadratic, P < 0.05), CP digestibility (quadratic, P < 0.01), N intake (quadratic, P < 0.01) and N balance (quadratic, P < 0.05). Inclusion of MS into the GS2-based ration had a positive linear effect on the ration fresh matter ad libitum intake (kg day(-1) and g kg(-1) M-0.75 day(-1)) (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively), NDF ad libitum intake (kg day(-1) and g kg P-1 M-0.75 day(-1)) (P < 0.01), digestibility of DM (P < 0.01), organic matter (OM) (P < 0.01), ADF (P < 0.05), starch (P < 0.001), digestibility of OM in DM (D-value) (P < 0.001), and N intake (P < 0.01). Positive associative effects of GS2 and MS were observed on all the intake and digestibility parameters measured, N intake (quadratic, P < 0.001) and N balance (quadratic, P < 0.05). It was concluded that, as expected, a positive associative response of GS2 and MS was recorded for all the measured parameters while that of GS1 and MS for a limited number of parameters, probably due to lower quality of MS (lower starch concentration) than required for improved utilization of the GS1-based ration.

Fiori & Paol.) as the principal crop. Wheat + lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus) sown in alternate rows, gave the highest wheat-equivalent yield (30.34 q/ha), followed by sole crop of lentil (27.81 q/ha) and of wheat (27.08 q/ha). Wheat + lentil and wheat + mustard [Brassica juncea (L.) Czernj. & Cosson] seed mixed in 1:1 ratio and sown in lines gave poor wheat-equivalent yield than the same crop mixture sown in alternate rows. Lowest wheat-equivalent yield (15.33 q/ha) was recorded with farmers' practice (seed mixture sown by broadcasting with no fertilizer). Sowing of different crops in alternate rows with no fertilizers yielded at par or even more compared with sowing of seed mixture by broadcasting of the same crops with the recommended dose of fertilizers.

Aims To investigate the relative contributions of pH, organic anions concentration, and phosphatase activity to rhizosphere soil phosphorus availability and crop phosphorus uptake in polycultures. Methods A field experiment was conducted for three consecutive years in a split-plot design with main plots treated with two phosphorus levels and subplots treated with maize and alfalfa grown alone or intercropped. Results Intercropped maize and alfalfa had 0.35 and 0.24 units lower rhizosphere pH, 28% and 30% higher total organic anions (TOA) concentration, and 21% and 41% greater acid phosphatase activity than those in monoculture. These changes in root exudates induced significant increases in rhizosphere phosphorus concentration of intercropped maize and alfalfa by 21% and 41%, and pH and TOA had greatest contributions, respectively. Rhizosphere phosphorus mobilization facilitated phosphorus uptake of intercropped maize, but this facilitation was offset by phosphorus uptake reduction due to decreased crown root surface area. Lateral root volume enhancement accounted for phosphorus uptake improvement of intercropped alfalfa by 86.6%, while rhizosphere phosphorus mobilization only had a 0.2% contribution. Conclusions Rhizosphere pH and organic anions exhibit greater contributions than acid phosphatase activity in enhancing rhizosphere phosphorus availability. However, root surface area of maize and lateral root volume of alfalfa unveil greater influences on crop phosphorus uptake than rhizosphere pH and organic anions.

Effects of strip width on yields in relay-strip intercropping: A simulation study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"Strip intercropping; Strip width; Wheat; Maize; Land Equivalent; Ratio (LER); Gross Margin Ratio (GMR)"	"RADIATION-USE EFFICIENCY; LAND EQUIVALENT RATIO; MODELING CANOPY PHOTOSYNTHESIS; ZEA-MAYS L.; LIGHT INTERCEPTION; GLOBAL RADIATION; DIRECT COMPONENT; WATER-USE; MAIZE; WHEAT"	Intercropping is the cultivation of multiple crop species on the same land. Relay strip intercropping is an intercropping system in which the component species are grown in strips, while the growing periods of the crop species overlap only partially. The effects of strip width on yields in relay-strip intercropping are still poorly understood. Here in a case study on wheat-maize relay intercropping a simple strip intercropping model was applied to quantify intercropping performance as a function of a wide range of strip widths. Simulations showed that (1) the optimum strip width is less than 1 meter and (2) benefits of intercropping rapidly drop as strips become wider. Most previous experimental work was also done at narrow configurations, with strips less than 3 meters wide. Benefits of intercropping may therefore be less than what would be expected from experiments if narrow configurations are not attainable because of lack of mechanisation. All optimised strip configurations showed a Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) larger than 1 indicating benefits of intercropping, irrespective of assumptions that were made on radiation use efficiency in intercropped species as compared to sole crops. At current prices of wheat and maize, however, intercropping gross margin exceeded sole cropping gross margin only if the intercrop RUE was larger than sole crop RUE for both species. This study shows that strip crop growth models can be used to specify needs for future machinery, that will enable farmers to attain benefits from intercropping.	"[van Oort, P. A.

However, which of the changed aspects induce the yield differences in intercropped soybean cultivars is still unknown. Four soybean cultivars with similar yield and growth and development processes in monoculture were selected by a pre-experiment. Field experiments were carried out from 2015 to 2017 to investigate the leaf photosynthetic parameters, total biomass, reproductive characteristics, yield and yield components of soybean. The yield of soybean cultivars was significantly decreased in intercropping systems and the yield of cultivars (cvs.) ZH39 and QH34 were considerably higher than those of cvs. HD19 and HD20. Besides, the pod and seed number and harvest index were also reduced by intercropping and the yield components of cvs. ZH39 and QH34 in intercropping were significantly higher than those of cvs. HD19 and HD20, other than the seed size. Although the parameters of leaf photosynthetic capacity (leaf area index, net photosynthetic rate, and chlorophyll content) of soybean were changed by intercropping, there was no significant difference among cultivars. Additionally, the CGR(R1-R5) (crop growth rate between R1 and R5) of intercropped soybean was lower than that of monoculture, while no significant differences were observed in different cultivars. The reproductive biomass at R5 was significantly different among soybean cultivars, and the reproductive partitioning and seed set efficiency of different cultivars were varied by the reproductive biomass at R5. Therefore, high-yielding cultivars in intercropping can achieve higher yield due to more reproductive structures survived at R5.

It was also indicated that incorporation of resistant and tolerant cultivars in an intercropping system offers an added advantage (by reducing the pest attack) to farmers who for some very good reasons had to plant the maize and sorghum dicrop (the worst combination). The use of resistant and tolerant cultivars therefore offers an alternative. In the study further observations were noted from three combinations, viz. resistant/resistant resistant/susceptible; and susceptible/susceptible. Results showed that there were no significant differences between resistant and resistant/susceptible combinations, suggesting the possibility of intercropping resistant and susceptible plants within a monoculture of multi-line intercropping- This finding opened up a new chapter in cropping systems in the sense that intercropping was seen as a practice that would also benefit large-scale farmers."

Cultivation of maize by inappropriate agricultural practices and on unsuitable sites is connected with specific risks of soil degradation, mainly due to water erosion of the soil. The aim of this study was to evaluate the yielding parameters, fodder quality and anti-erosion efficiency of different methods of conservation tillage for maize in two areas (Jevicko-JEV and SkoupATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH ACUTE-SKO) with different climate and soil conditions in the Czech Republic in the period 2016-2018, using multivariate exploratory techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis (FA). Four variants of soil tillage methods were analysed: Conventional Tillage (CT), two slightly different Strip-Till techniques (ST) and Direct Sowing (DS). The analysed parameters were: dry mass of the plants, height of the plants, starch content (SC), organic matter digestibility (OMD) and content of neutral detergent fibre (NDF), soil loss by erosion and surface runoff. The multivariate exploratory techniques PCA and FA significantly differed in two categories of techniques in both locations. The first category consists of soil conservation techniques (SCT): ST (JEV/SKO) and DS (JEV). These techniques are characterised by lower yields of dry mass, lower height of plants, forage quality equal to CT, but a high level of protection of the soil against erosion. The second category consists of CT (JEV and SKO) and partially of DS (SKO). These treatments are characterised by high dry mass production, higher plants, high forage quality, but a feeble capacity of protection of the soil against erosion. The results of the study confirm the presumption of the positive influence of introduction and application of new agronomical practices in the areas of interest and other areas with similar natural conditions in the sense of sustainable management for agricultural management of agricultural land for the conditions of the Czech Republic and therefore of Central and Eastern Europe. PCA and FA were used as an effective method for comprehensive evaluation of the use of STC in agricultural practice.

Improving the food security of low-resource farmers: Introducing horsegram into maize-based cropping systems	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article								In the hilly areas of eastern Gujarat, western Madhya Pradesh and southern Rajasthan, in western India, farmers are very resource-poor and cultivate small and fragmented land holdings. Maize is their main rainy season (kharif) cereal and it is grown as a rainfed crop in low-fertility fields, often on sloping land that is vulnerable to soil erosion. Its productivity is very low, averaging below 1 t ha(-1). New farm technologies to increase this productivity have to be low cost to be attractive to farmers who have limited access to purchased inputs and few means to purchase them. From observations of local farming practices, intercropping of maize with legumes was identified as an attractive option because the only additional input needed is seed of the legume crop. Participatory research was conducted on intercropping of maize with improved varieties of horsegram (Macrotyloma uniflorum). Many farmers who tried this intercropping adopted it in subsequent years, while others preferred to grow the new horsegram varieties as a sole crop. Farmers reported that less weeding was required in the intercrop as the horsegram smothered weeds. All farmers used the dry stover from the horsegram as a fodder for their animals. Farmers used the whole seed as dal, which provided additional protein in their diet. Farmers also sold the grain, but it fetched a low price in the poorly developed market for horsegram. Previously intercropping had been tried with local landraces, but the acceptance of intercropping was higher with new varieties such as AK-42 that yielded over 60% more grain. Participatory trials in which only one entry was compared with the local variety did not show a difference between AK-21 and AK-42 as in all cases both were preferred over the local variety. When they were directly compared with each other, farmers' perceptions showed a significant preference for AK-42. Variety IVH-2 was found to be better than AK-42: it matured 15 days earlier, better matching the maturity of the maize, had superior grain quality and yielded about the same. The greater uptake of improved horsegram varieties for sole and intercropping is likely to be limited by the lack of seed supply.

Under Mediterranean conditions, pea-oat intercrop has shown high land-use efficiency (LER). Field experiments were established under rainfed conditions in two locations in Greece for two growing seasons (2011-12 and 2012-13) to assess agronomic traits [date to flowering, plant height at stem elongation BBCH32, fmal plant height, and lodging], dry matter yield (DM), quality traits (protein, fat and ash concentrations, nitrogen free extracts), crop protein yield (CPY), and the competitive ability of three oat and three field pea cultivars in intercrops and Sole crops. The intercrops produced on average 6.7% less DM than the oat sole crops, but had 27% higher CPY. However, interactions were found for the DM between the two locations, regarding species, cultivars and cropping systems, indicating that cultivars performed differently in sole crop and intercrops. Across locations, a pea-oat combination was the most consistent, showing the highest values of LER and monetary advantage index (MAI) that indicated its wide adaptation. Moreover, a second pea-oat combination showed specific adaptation to the warm and soil N-poor location. One testing environment favoured the high competitive ability of peas, whereas the other favoured the oat, possibly due to higher N-NO3 availability. Intercropped oat flowered later, was shorted at the stem elongation stage, and lodged more than sole crops. On the other hand, peas flowered later and were taller at stem elongation stage, as well in final plant height in comparison to their peers in sole crop. Overall, the results highlighted the need of multi environment trials to assess the effects of genotype x environment interactions in order to select compatible cultivars for maximizing the productivity and stability of the pea-oat intercrops.

Improving genetic adaptation of crop genotypes together with suitable agronomic management practices can mitigate the impact on crop production in acid soils. The objective of the present study was to determine the photosynthetic and grain yield responses of two common bean lines to intercropping with maize under two types of fertilizer applications in the Colombian Amazon region. A randomized complete block design (RCBD) with 3 replications in a nested trifactorial arrangement was used consisting of two advanced bean lines of BFS 10 and ALB 121 (main plots); three cropping system patterns of monoculture, intercropping pattern 1, intercropping pattern 2 (subplots); and two types of fertilizer applications, chemical and organic (sub-subplots) for a total of 12 treatments. The experiment was conducted in two growing seasons and the effects of the treatments were evaluated during two growth stages within a cropping season. Measurements included photosynthetic gas exchange characteristics, chlorophyll fluorescence, specific leaf area, viability of pollen and grain yield. Mean values from two growing seasons were presented. Photosynthetic response of BFS 10 was superior to ALB 121 under both monoculture and intercropping patterns with either chemical or organic fertilizer application. Both bean lines showed an increase in apparent quantum efficiency and maximum rate of ribulose-1, 5bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) carboxylation (Vcmax) during pod filling growth stage when grown in association with maize, particularly with organic fertilizer application. Small farmers in the Amazon region can benefit from either one of the two bean lines by growing them as intercrops with maize, using organic fertilizer application."

Conservation agriculture (CA) has been proposed as one of those solutions and field level data show marked benefits of this new cropping system. Nevertheless, the use of rotations and/or associations in CA systems is challenging at both the farm and community level. Intercropped maize (Zea mays L.) with grain legumes, cowpea and pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L. (Millsp.)), as well as maize rotated with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. (Walp)) and sunnhemp (Crotalaria ochroleuca L.) was studied for up to eight seasons under CA and conventional agriculture in Zimbabwe. The objective of this study, carried out on-farm and on-station, was to highlight the effects of CA systems on some soil quality indicators and crop productivity. Where possible the specific effects of rotation and intercropping was separated and compared with monocropping. The on-station and on-farm results show: an increase of up to 331% in water infiltration, a 31% greater soil carbon in the top 60 cm than on adjacent conventionally ploughed fields, a 6% lower bulk density in the top 10 cm and 32.5-36 t ha(-1) less cumulative soil erosion in CA fields after seven cropping seasons compared with the conventional control treatment. The comparative productivity analysis between continuous maize, maize intercropped with cowpea or pigeon pea and maize in rotation with cowpea or sunnhemp, shows marked benefits of rotation especially in CA systems. The benefits of CA especially when rotated with leguminous crops, increase over time, suggesting that there are improvements in soil structure and fertility. However, field level benefits will not increase the overall adoption of rotations and intercropping in CA systems, unless the socio-economic constraints at the farm and community level are addressed.

RAEUSCHEL; WEST-AFRICA; MANAGEMENT; PERCEPTIONS; FREQUENCY; SYSTEMS; GROWTH; YIELD"	Speargrass [Imperata eylindrica (L.) Raeuschel] is a noxious weed widespread in most tropical zones of the world. Studies were conducted in the savannah of West Africa from 1997 to 1999 to evaluate crop yield, speargrass control, and net benefit from the use of cover crops integrated with handweeding and chemical control in maize and cassava. Glyphosate and handweeding were main treatments. Subplot treatments were type of cover crop [velvetbean, Mucuna cochinchinensis (Lour.) A. Chev., kudzu, Pueraria phaseoloides (Roxb.) Benth, and velvetbean intercropped with kudzu] and plots without cover crops. Weeding five times or applying glyphosate was more effective than weeding twice in preventing crop yield losses and suppressing speargrass. Plots that received glyphosate or those weeded five times had 28-59% higher crop yields than plots weeded twice at all locations. In maize, subplots without cover crop had 30% more maize grain yield than plots with cover crops. In cassava, subplots without cover crops at Ezillo and plots where kudzu was intercropped with velvetbean at Ogoja had the lowest cassava tuber yields. Speargrass was more effectively suppressed in plots with cover crops than in plots without cover crops. Across all main treatments, velvetbean nearly eliminated rhizomes of speargrass within 2 years of treatment application at Avrankou. It was cheaper to use glyphosate than handweeding for speargrass control in both crops. Cover crops generally gave better economic benefit in cassava while in maize an opposite trend was observed.

Farming practices used in production of these crops may affect nematode community assemblages and influence agricultural productivity. Information on response of nematofauna, particularly free-living nematodes, under various agronomic practices in Kenyan maize-beans intercrop is scarce. This study reports on the effects of farming practices on nematode community dynamics, ecological and functional indices, nematode metabolic footprints, and predator-prey relationship in maize-beans cropping systems in Mwea, Kenya. The field trials were set up in two seasons in a randomized complete block design with each treatment consisting of four replicates. The treatments included cow manure plus chemical fertilizer (CmDCF), cow manure plus wood ash (CmWa), cow manure combined with wood ash plus fertilizers (CmWaF), chemical fertilizers only (DNF) and unamended controls. Soil samples were collected at 0-20 cm depth at bimonthly intervals during 2018-2019. During the two seasons, 54 nematode genera were identified. Cephalobus, and Heterocephalobus (bacterivores), Labronema (omnivore) and Nygolaimus (predator) were abundant in CmDCF, CmWa, CmWaF, and DNF while Aphelenchus and Aphelenchoides (fungivores) were dominant in all treatments. Principal response curve analysis showed that CmWaF significantly reduced the population of Helicotylenchus, Scutellonema and Rotylenchulus during the 2nd and 4th month in the second season. Renyi diversity analysis indicated that CmWaF had higher diversity of omnivores while functional metabolic footprints categorized it as structured in both seasons. Predator-prey analysis suggested that CmWa and CmWaF have the potential to provide suitable conditions for predators, target prey and amplifiable prey biomass. This study provides an insight on the implication of farming practices, on nematode abundance and soil food web in two economically important crops in Kenya. It also provides a basis for exploring the potential role of organic amendments containing cow manure in control of plant parasitic nematodes in maize-beans cropping systems.

In this study, in order to clarify the response of marginal superiority to maize morphology and plant-density tolerance, field experiments without water and nutrition stress were conducted at Qitai Farm in Xinjiang, China, in 2013-2014 and 2016-2019. The results showed that no more than three border rows of all the cultivars had marginal superiority under high density, about 90% of all the cultivars had no more than two border row that had marginal superiority and a significant negative correlation was observed between marginal superiority and population grain yield (first border row: y=-2.193x+213.9, p<0.05; second border row: y=-2.076x+159.2, p<0.01). Additionally, marginal superiority was found to have a significant positive relationship with plant density (first border row: y=6.049x+73.76, p<0.01; second border row: y=1.88x+95.41, p<0.05) and the average leaf angle above the ear (first border row: y=2.306x+103.1, p<0.01). These results indicated that the smaller the leaf angle above the ear, the weaker the marginal superiority and the higher the grain yield. It suggests that the magnitude of marginal superiority in the border rows can be an indicator for plant-density tolerance under high density. What's more, cultivars with small leaf angle above the ear can be selected to weaken the marginal superiority and improve grain yield under high plant density. Conversely, cultivars with a large leaf angle above the ear can be selected to achieve higher individual yield in intercropping systems with no more than four rows alternated with other crops."

The alternative row strategy produced significantly less LER value than the other two arrangements. While, there was an increase in LER values in both the component species of the mixtures, the magnitude of effect was greater with the barley (average of 30.0% increase) than it was with the peas (average of 14.8% increase). Grain/seed yields of both components of the intercrop mixtures were greater than would be expected if these were expected to yield half that of the sole crops. The increases were brought about by an increase in the number of ears m(-2) in barley and pods m(-2) in peas. Analysis of N uptake suggests that greater N availability for the barley component of the mixture was the mechanism responsible for the increased barley yields. Improved pea growth is likely to have arisen from the support offered by the barley plants, which was greatest in the mixed and cross rows, but least in the pairs of alternate rows.

These trials compare conventional (Cony) and organic (Org) farming systems at high and low input levels at two locations, i.e. Chuka, with Humic Nitisols, high inherent soil fertility and rainfall, and Thika, with Rhodic Nitisols with low soil fertility and rainfall. The high input systems (High) represent commercial-scale, export-oriented production that uses the recommended amounts of fertilisers, pesticides and irrigation water to generate high yields, whilst the low input systems (Low) represent local smallholder practices, using relatively few fertilisers and pesticides and operating under rain-fed conditions. The conventional systems received synthetic fertilisers and organic manure, whilst the organic systems only received organic inputs. The trials so far have consisted of a 6-season, 3-year, crop rotation with maize (Zea mays L.) planted in the long rainy seasons (March-September), and vegetables in the short rainy seasons (October February). Generally, there were no significant differences in the dry matter yields and nutrient uptake by maize, baby corn or beans between the conventional and organic systems at either site. Similar maize grain and baby corn yields were also obtained at Chuka. However, at Thika, maize grain yields in Org-High in 2007 (at conversion) were lower than the yields in Cony-High, but the yields became similar in 2010 (after conversion). At the same site the yields of maize grain under sole cropping in Org-Low were 3.2 times lower than the yields in Cony Low in 2007 and 1.7 times lower in 2010. When intercropped with beans the yields of the two systems were similar. In the first two years profits from Cony-High were 0.5-1.8 times and 0.2-2.4 times higher than in Org-High when selling the produce at local (Chuka and Thika) and regional markets (Nairobi), but thereafter the profit from the two was similar, even when organic produce was sold at regular market prices. From the fifth year onwards Org-High attracted a price premium of 20 to 50% and this made it 1.3 to 4.1 times more profitable than Cony-High when selling on local and regional markets (in Chuka, Thika and Nairobi). Compared to Cony-High, partial N and K balances at the two sites were positive and higher in Org-High, except for N at Chuka. Our findings demonstrate that Org-High is productive, economically viable, resource-conserving and can contribute to sustainable agriculture production in Kenya depending on regional conditions and the crops cultivated.

Intercropping cereals with food or green manure legumes is recommended for enhancing the supply of nitrogen to the cereal. However, Most studies Oil the benefits of intercropping legumes with cereals are reported from the drier regions and those too with only food legumes. A field study was undertaken for three consecutive years to ascertain the impact of intercropping maize (Zea mays L) With either a food legume (Phaseolus beans - Phaseolus vulgaris L) or a green manure (sunhemp) - (Crotolaria juncea L.) in a rainfed minor season of the humid tropics. The legumes Were intercropped with maize at the Onset of rains and the biomass incorporated after the harvest of pools (beans) or at lowering (sunhemp), which corresponded to the time of silking in maize. After the harvest Of maize, the plots were planted with I monocrop of maize in the major season. The same treatments were planted in the same plots in the following minor season. This process was repeated over three years to encompass three minor seasons. Intercropping Of legumes increased germination of the cereal Over the seasons. More importantly, the incorporation Of the legume residues increased maize Shoot biomass over time. Yields of maize intercropped with beans were similar to the monoculture, in the first season and were significantly higher in the third season. Intercropping with Crotolaria produced lower yields than the monocultures, but the differences reduced significantly cover dine. Incorporation of the legumes reduced the nitrogen Use efficiency, thus illustrating a lower mining effect, in contrast to the maize monoculture, which had a higher nitrogen Uptake. Hence, the use of a green manure, especially, short-term food legumes such as beans, which provides an economic harvest, is a viable alternative to monocropping systems of maize commonly adopted in the minor seasons Of the humid tropics, When evapotransipiration exceeds rainfall. The prospects of producing maize in these minor seasons while developing sustainable systems over time is presented on the basis of this three-year field study.

This created the need for the introduction of more sustainable systems such as no-tillage and crop-livestock integration. This study analyzed the effect of succession of corn+forage and soybean on soil physical properties. For this purpose, four forages (Brachiaria brizantha, B. ruziziensis, Panicum maximum cv. Tanzania, and P. maximum cv. Aries), were sown in an intercropping trial with maize in three modalities (in the corn row mixed with fertilizer; broadcast at corn sowing; and broadcast in corn stage V4) and corn without intercropping (control), in the experimental area of UNESP, campus Ilha Solteira. Summer soybean was sown on the crop remains of previous treatments. To determine macro and microporosity, total porosity and bulk density soil was sampled twice, after the maize and after the soybean harvest.

This effect was confirmed by further field testing and shown to be significantly greater than that observed with other legumes, e. g., cowpea, as were the concomitant yield increases. The mechanism was investigated, and although soil shading and addition of nitrogen fertilizer showed some benefits against S. hermonthica infestation, a putative allelopathic mechanism for D. uncinatum was observed. In screenhouse studies, a highly significant reduction in S. hermonthica infestation was obtained when an aqueous solution, eluting from pots in which D. uncinatum plants were growing, was used to irrigate pots of maize planted in soil seeded with high levels of S. hermonthica. Growth of the parasitic weed was almost completely suppressed, whereas extensive infestation occurred with the control eluate. Laboratory investigations into the allelopathic effect of D. uncinatum, using samples of water-soluble chemical components exuded from cleaned roots, demonstrated that this involved a germination stimulant for S. hermonthica and also an inhibitor for haustorial development.

In this work, we studied the genomic expression of Rhizobium phaseoli Ch24-10 (by RNA-seq) after a 2-h treatment in the presence of root exudates of maize and bean grown in monoculture and milpa system under hydroponic conditions. In bean exudates, rhizobial genes for nodulation and degradation of aromatic compounds were induced; while in maize, a response of genes for degradation of mucilage and ferulic acid was observed, as well as those for the transport of sugars, dicarboxylic acids and iron. Ch24-10 transcriptomes in milpa resembled those of beans because they both showed high expression of nodulation genes; some genes that were expressed in corn exudates were also induced by the intercropping system, especially those for the degradation of ferulic acid and pectin. Beans grown in milpa system formed nitrogen-fixing nodules similar to monocultured beans; therefore, the presence of maize did not interfere with Rhizobium-bean symbiosis. Genes for the metabolism of sugars and amino acids, flavonoid and phytoalexin tolerance, and a T3SS were expressed in both monocultures and milpa system, which reveals the adaptive capacity of rhizobia to colonize both legumes and cereals. Transcriptional fusions of the putA gene, which participates in proline metabolism, and of a gene encoding a polygalacturonase were used to validate their participation in plant-microbe interactions. We determined the enzymatic activity of carbonic anhydrase whose gene was also overexpressed in response to root exudates."

However, their coupled effects on rhizospheric microbial communities under a continuous vegetable cropping system have not been adequately addressed. The objective of the present study was to assess the effects on soil microbial community and yields of waxy maize (Zea mays L.) intercropped with or without residue retention in a continuous broccoli (Brassica oleracea L.) cropping system, i.e., relay intercropping of broccoli and waxy maize (B/M-B), relay intercropping of broccoli and waxy maize with residue retention (B/MR-B), and broccoli monoculture (B-B). The biomass yields of spring and autumn vegetables in B/MR-B were 16.3%-32.5% and 30.1%-46.1% higher than those of B-B, respectively. Autumn vegetable economic yields of B/MR-B were 28.2%-40.3% higher than B-B. The average well color development followed the order: B/MR-B > B/M-B > B-B. The Shannon index, Simpson index, and McIntosh index were higher in B/MR-B than under monoculture. A principal component analysis showed that microbial communities of B/MR-B soils differed from those of B/M-B and B-B soils. Carbon (C) sources utilized by the rhizosphere microorganisms were mainly carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, amino acids, and polymers; however, the C sources for the soil microbial community differed between intercropping and monoculture. The communities from B/MR-B preferred amino acids and polymers. Available nitrogen (N), potassium (K), and phosphorus (P) had an obvious impact on soil microbial community. Additionally, the C source utilization by microorganisms was significantly affected by pH and available K and P. Cropping system diversification through relay intercropping and residue retention effectively improved the functional diversity of the soil microbial communities and increased the yields of vegetables."

The major objective is to determine an optimal fertilizer application scheme for an irrigated agricultural system. Such a scheme would not degrade the quality of the environment, and yet would maintain a profitable level of crop production. This study is explicitly related to the cultivation of irrigated maize, a major crop in the area. The various terms of the water balance (consumption, drainage, soil storage) and of the nitrogen cycle (mineralization, plant uptake, leaching) were obtained from intensive monitoring in the upper layer of the 0.8 m of soil which corresponds to the root zone of the crop. This entailed the combined use of a neutron moisture meter, tensiometers and soil suction cups. To determine the specific effects of fertilization and crop growth, there were different treatments. These corresponded to a traditional fertilizer application of 260 kg N ha-1, no fertilization, and bare soil, carried out within an area of approximately 2 ha. Several sites were instrumented on each treatment, one of them being specifically for the application and the monitoring of N-15-tagged fertilizer. The results have shown that, in terms of the water balance, irrigation water management is extremely efficient, as drainage losses under the maize culture are negligible during the crop cycle. The situation is totally different, however, during the intercrop period (October-April), owing to rainfall. Then the soil is left bare and evaporation is very small, and now the drainage corresponds to about 90% of total inputs from precipitation. In terms of the nitrogen cycle, the results showed clearly that up to 150 kg N ha-1 was produced by mineralization in the soil. Nitrogen leaching beyond the root zone during the crop cycle is negligible, regardless of the rate of fertilizer application, as a result of the very small amount of drainage, despite irrigation. A very important contrast was found, however, between the fertilized and unfertilized treatments at harvest. There was a residue of 182 +/- 64 kg N ha-1 in the fertilized sites, but none for the others. The whole quantity remaining in the root zone at harvest was then totally leached by winter rains. To decrease the risk of groundwater pollution, a reduction of about 100 kg N ha-1 from the traditional application rate has been recommended. Finally, the method of estimation of N balance has been successfully validated by a comparison between N uptake determined by direct analysis of the whole plant and the value estimated from the temporal variations of the N content in the soil.

By comparing the single cropping of corn (SCC) with the intercropping of corn with three leguminous crops; i.e., mung bean (CM), black soybean (CB), and peanut (CP), this study investigated the effects of various leguminous intercrops on corn growth and yield. The experiment results indicate that intercropping corn with the mentioned leguminous crops increases the plant height, leaf area, and relative growth rate of the corn. In addition, the average single ear weight was 14.6%, 15.93%, and 22.1% higher in the CB, CM, and CP, respectively, when compared with that in the SCC, suggesting that the intercropping of corn with peanut is most beneficial for corn yield. Moreover, the number of rhizobia in the CP was 4.0 and 5.9 times the numbers in the CM and CB during the harvest period; the highest soil nitrogen content was also found in the CP (147.5 mg/kg), 2.0-2.2 times those in the other arrangements. This suggests that the abundant rhizobia on peanut roots increase the nitrogen content of soil and substantially boost corn yield. Intercropping corn with a leguminous crop thus increases both the growth and yield of the corn; compared with mung bean and black soybean, peanut was discovered to maximize growth and yield benefits as the most profitable intercrop."

Attempts to intercrop yellow lupine with cereals have often resulted in failure. In combined production, the relative amount of lupine has proven to be considerably smaller given the sowing mix proportions and its yield potential in pure stand. Low yield is attributed to lupine's low competitive potential, therefore strip intercropping presents a viable alternative. The main goal of the experiment was to determine the response of yellow lupine to the neighboring presence of wheat, triticale, barley, and pea, as well as to estimate the production effects of lupine in strip intercropping. Field trials were carried out in Poland (53 degrees 13 ' N; 17 degrees 51 ' E) in the years 2008-2010. The experimental factor consisted of row layout: a four-row separation between lupine and the neighboring species. The proximity of cereals and peas proved to be most unfavorable to yellow lupine. It was determined that yellow lupine was most intolerant of barley and least affected by the proximity of peas. Depending on the neighboring species, adverse effects extended up to the third row of lupine's canopy. A beneficial alternative for the production effect involves an introduction of a path separating the lupine strip from the tested species."

An experiment was initiated to Study the influence of companion food crops on the root distribution patterns of young oil palm in southwest Nigeria. The experiment used a randomized complete block design (RCBE) with three replicates. There were ten treatments comprised or four sole cropping and six involving intercropping oil palm with soybean (Glycine max), maize (Zea mays) and cocoyam (Xanthosoma sagittifolium). Yields of food crops were significantly different among the various intercrops and cropping seasons. The highest soybean seed was recorded in the oil palm + soybean plot and the lowest in the oil palm + soybean + maize + cocoyarn plot. Maize grain yields were highest in the oil palm + maize plot and lowest in the oil palm + soybean + maize + cocoyam plot. Cocoyam corm yields were highest in the oil palm + cocoyam plot and lowest in the oil palm + soybean + maize + cocoyam plot. The intercropped soybean, maize and cocoyam are useful for human consumption, animal feed and income. They play magnificent roles in nutrient cycling, erosion and weed control, water conservation. and maintenance of favorable soil physical properties in addition to reducing the risk of crop failure.

The analysis relies on a flexible moment-based specification of a stochastic production function in a multinomial endogenous switching regression framework to correct for the selection bias stemming both from observed and unobserved heterogeneity. A quantile moment approach is used to estimate the cost of risk. After controlling for the effects of unobserved heterogeneity and several observable variables on maize production and downside risk functions, estimation results show that the adoption of SIPs increases food security and reduces downside risk exposure and the cost of risk. We estimate greater food security and larger reduction in downside risk from simultaneous adoption of both crop diversification (maize-legume intercropping and rotations) and minimum tillage, suggesting that there are complementary benefits from these practices. We find most of the cost of risk comes from exposure to downside risk. Our findings imply that in dealing with production risks development agents should encourage the adoption of agronomic and resource-management practices along with other risk mitigation and food security improving strategies.

The experiments were conducted during two consecutive spring and summer seasons in 1999 and 2000 in replicated field experiments. The Gompertz model described disease progress curves better than the logistic model. Intercropping delayed epidemic onset, lowered disease incidence and severity, and reduced the disease progress rate. The type of cropping system and planting pattern affected CBB incidence and severity at initial, final and overall assessments and also affected the rate of disease development. Statistical significance of treatment interactions based on disease assessments was found for incidence in all four experiments and for severity in three experiments. A slower disease progress rate and lower incidence and severity occurred on beans planted with maize or sorghum in row, mixed and broadcast intercropping than on bean planted alone. Incidence was reduced 36% and severity 20% in intercropping compared to sole cropping. The built-in disease delay and the slowing of the disease progress rate could provide protection for beans from severe CBB epidemics in intercropped systems. Variation between years appeared to be related to relative humidity (RH).

Soil aggregation and total diversity of bacteria and fungi in various tillage systems of sub-humid and semi-arid Kenya	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY			English	Article						"Intercropping; Crop residues; Maize; Soybean; Soil structure; PCR-DGGE; Tillage"	"GRADIENT GEL-ELECTROPHORESIS; ORGANIC-MATTER; MICROBIAL COMMUNITY; CROP-ROTATION; RED LATOSOL; CARBON; STABILITY; PLANT; POPULATIONS; MECHANISMS"	Stable soil aggregates and high microbial diversity are essential for efficient nutrient recycling in soil. This study evaluated effects of different arable land-use systems on soil aggregation and associated composition and total diversity of bacteria and fungi. For this purpose, 5- and 3-year-old field trials were selected, two in sub-humid (orthic Acrisols and oxidic Ferralsols) and one in semi-arid (chromic Cambisol) region in Kenya. The treatments included combinations of tillage (conventional tillage [CT] and reduced tillage [RT]), crop residue management (0 and 2 t ha(-1) maize stover) and cropping systems (continuous maize, maize-soybean intercropping and rotation) in the sub-humid sites, and of different tillage (CT, no-till and tied-ridging) and organic fertilization management (manure and crop residue) in semi-arid Kenya. The innovativeness of this study is the research in tropical soils where the concept of aggregate hierarchy is not generally accepted yet. The results showed that aggregate mean weight diameter (MWD) at 0-15 cm depths had increased from 19 to 34% under RT relative to CT management (P < 0.05). Crop residue additions also significantly increased MWD by 22% at the top 5 cm (P < 0.01) compared to treatments without residue in oxidic Ferralsols. At all the three sites, tillage resulted in greatest shifts of bacterial and fungal community composition, while cropping system had largest positive effect on the total microbial diversity indices. Total microbial diversity indices as well as MWD were higher in soybean-maize intercropping systems than under rotation or continuous maize cropping. Changes in total bacterial diversity related inversely to changes in the amount of free silt + clay, while fungal diversity related inversely to the contents of soil macro-aggregates > 2 mm (P < 0.05). We conclude that RI plus supply of organic resources and intercropping are best strategies to increase total diversity of soil bacteria and fungi and improve soil structure in these tropical soils.

Growth dynamics and agronomic-economic benefits of pea-oat and pea-barley intercrops	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE			English	Article						"aggressivity; competition; forage; intercropping advantage; LER; monetary advantage"	"VARYING SEEDING RATIOS; LAND EQUIVALENT RATIO; FABA BEAN INTERCROPS; COMMON VETCH; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; NITROGEN YIELD; USE EFFICIENCY; GRAIN-YIELD; DRY-MATTER; SYSTEMS"	Pea (Pisum arvense L.) is an important legume inmany areas of the world, which is used for forage and grain production and could be used in intercropping systems. Intercropping of pea with oat (Avena sativa L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), in two seeding ratios 60 : 40 and 80 : 20, was compared with pea and two cereal monocrops for two growing seasons (2008-10), at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. The effect of the intercropping systemswas determined on growth rate, plant height, chlorophyll content, DM, and N yield. Also, several competition and economic indices were used to evaluate the intercropping systems, such as land equivalent ratio (LER), relative crowding coefficient (K), aggressivity (A), competitive ratio (CR), actual yield loss (AYL), system productivity index (SPI), monetary advantage index (MAI), and intercropping advantage (IA). Growth rate of pea and cereals was lower by an average of 39 and 64%, respectively, in the intercrops than in themonocrops. DM yield was the highest in barley monocrop (13.00 Mg ha(-1)) followed by P80O20 intercrop (11.73Mg ha(-1)). Pea monocrop, and P80O20 and P80B20 intercrops showed the highest crude protein (CP) concentration (137, 132 and 130 g kg(-1) DM, respectively), whereas P80O20 intercrop also produced the highest CP yield (1552 kg ha(-1)). The LER, K, and AYL values (average 1.09, 1.75 and 0.29, respectively), were greater for both pea-oat intercrops compared with the pea-barley intercrops (average 0.98, 0.92 and 0.06, respectively), indicating that in these systems there was an advantage of intercropping for exploiting the resources of the environment. The A, CR, and partial AYL values in all intercrops were greater for oat and barley than pea, which indicated that cereals were more competitive partners than pea. The highest MAI, IA, and SPI values were recorded for P80O20 followed by P60O40 intercrops indicating that these intercropping systems were the most profitable. The results from this study showed that both pea-oat intercrops were more productive with high CP yield, and also they showed the best land-use efficiency.

Therefore, the study was conducted to test the hypothesis that the inclusion of intensified leguminous live mulch systems can improve system productivity, carbon management index (CMI), and soil health. Two cropping systems viz, summer maize-rainy season maize-lentil (SM-RM-L); and summer maize-rainy season maize-mustard (SM-RM-Ma) and five tillage and mulching practices such as 1) no-till (NT); 2) NT with live mulch (NT-LM); 3) reduced tillage (RT); 4) RT with live mulch (RT-LM); and 5) conventional tillage (CT) were tested in a split-plot design. Results revealed that yield attributes and yields of summer and rainy season maize, and cowpea were higher under SM-RM-L than the SM-RM-Ma cropping system. But in the winter, crop yields were higher under SM-RM-Ma than the SM-RM-L cropping system. NT-LM and RT-LM recorded 39.5 % and 48.4 % average higher grain yield of summer maize over the CT. The soil under the NT-LM had the maximum very labile C (2.32 g kg(-1)); the labile C fraction was the highest in soil under CT (1.72 g kg(-1)). The non-labile C fraction of soil organic carbon (SOC) was higher under NT and NT-LM than the rest of the tillage/mulch treatments in 0-10 cm depth. The soil under RT-LM had a higher lability index (LL1.62) than the rest of the treatments in 0-10 cm depth. Conversely, in 10-20 cm depth, the soil under NT had higher LI (1.77) than the rest of the treatments. The soil under NT-LM and RT-LM had higher CPI and CMI than those in the rest of the treatments. Water holding capacity (WHC), infiltration rate, and cumulative infiltration were significantly higher under NT-LM and RT-LM than the other treatments. Thus, the study indicated the positive role of LM based conservation tillage practices in improving soil properties, carbon management indices, and productivity of maize-based cropping systems in the eastern Indian Himalayas."

MOENCH; PEARL-MILLET; INTERNAL AERATION; SORGHUM; GROWTH; AFRICA; TOLERANCE; NAMIBIA"	Flash floods, erratically striking semi-arid regions, often cause field flooding and soil anoxia, resulting in crop losses on food staples, typically pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L) Moench). Recent glasshouse studies have indicated that rice (Oryza spp.) can enhance flood stress tolerance of co-growing dryland cereals by modifying their rhizosphere microenvironments via the oxygen released from its roots into the aqueous rhizosphere. We tested whether this phenomenon would be expressed under field flood conditions. The effects of mix-planting of pearl millet and sorghum with rice on their survival, growth and grain yields were evaluated under controlled field flooding in semi-arid Namibia during 2014/2015-2015/2016. Single-stand and mixed plant treatments were subjected to 11-22 day flood stress at the vegetative growth stage. Mixed planting increased plant survival rates in both pearl millet and sorghum. Grain yields of pearl millet and sorghum were reduced by flooding, in both the single-stand and mixed plant treatments, relative to the non-flooded upland yields, but the reduction was lower in the mixed plant treatments. In contrast, flooding increased rice yields. Both pearl millet rice and sorghum rice mixtures demonstrated higher land equivalent ratios, indicating a mixed planting advantage under flood conditions. These results indicate that mix-planting pearl millet and sorghum with rice could alleviate flood stress on dryland cereals. The results also suggest that with this cropping technique, rice could compensate for the dryland cereal yield losses due to field flooding. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Kuntze. Practices combining zero-tillage with permanent soil cover by intercropped legumes and crop residue mulches - known as Conservation Agriculture (CA)-are proposed as remedy against soil and climatic constraints. Implications of these practices for S. asiatica are unknown. A 4-season factorial experiment compared the current farmer practice of rice - maize rotation, involving seasonal tillage and crop residue removal (CONV), with three rice - maize rotation systems following CA with different cover crops, i.e. Vigna unguiculata (cowpea) and Mucuna pruriens (CACM), Vigna umbellata (ricebean) (CARE), and Srylosanthes guianensis (CAST). Performance of two rice varieties, NERICA-4 and -9, with partial S. asiatica resistance, were compared with the locally popular B22. Parasite emergence time, numbers, and seed bank sizes were recorded. In all CA practices S. asiatica infection was significantly reduced. Best results were obtained with Stylosanthes guianensis (CAST). This species also suppressed ordinary weeds much better than other cover crops. With CAST, average parasite emergence was delayed by 7.5 days (in rice) and 6.3 days (in maize) and infection levels were reduced by 79% (in rice) and 92% (in maize) compared to the conventional farmer practice (CONV). NERICA varieties delayed S. astatica emergence by 5.7 days (NERICA-9) and 9.7 days (NERICA-4) and reduced infection levels by 57% (NERICA-9) and 91% (NERICA-4) compared to B22. In maize the residual effect of resistance of NERICA-4 resulted in a delay of 7.5 days in S. asiatica emergence and a reduction of 60% in parasite numbers. The best combinations delay S. asiatica emergence by 17.8 days (CAST + NERICA-9) and 19.1 days (CARE + NERICA-4) and reduce the parasite infection levels by 96% (CAST + NERICA-9 or -4) to 98% (CARS + NERICA-4) in rice, compared to CONV + B22. After two full rice-maize rotation cycles S. asiatica seed numbers in the soil (0-10 cm) were 76% (CACM), 78% (CAST) and 86% (CARE) lower than under CONV. Even the combination of zero-tillage, crop residue mulching, cover crops and resistant rice varieties does not entirely prevent S. astatica parasitism and seed bank increase. Additional measures, targeted to escaping weeds, would be required for fully effective and long-term control.

Root injury ratings and cumulative emergence of adults of western corn rootworms, as taken from emergence cages, were lowest in plots where eggs had been infested into compacted interrows. Measurements of soil bulk density, air-filled porosity, and air permeability were taken on core samples to characterize soil physical properties in relation to soil compaction. Lowest rootworm survival and injury coincided with higher bulk density, lower air-filled porosity, and lower air permeability values characteristic of soil from the compacted interrow plots. Survival and establishment of western corn rootworm larvae were associated with greater soil pore continuity in uncompacted plots. Soil compaction induced by controlled wheel traffic may have potential as a management strategy for reducing larval corn rootworm movement into strip intercropped maize adjacent to areas previously planted to maize and rotated into a crop that is not a host for corn rootworms.

The aim of this study was to compare production efficiency in intercropping with sole cropping in terms of radiant energy use. For analysing crop radiation capture and utilisation, three indices are often used: the fraction of radiation intercepted (F), radiation use efficiency (RUE) and harvest index (HI). Using those indices, maize-bean intercropping was evaluated and compared with maize and bean sole cropping systems. The findings were as follows: the intercrop F was higher than the sole crop E the sole maize RUE was higher than the others, and there was no difference in HI among cropping systems. From those results, the intercropping may be equivalent to maize sole cropping in the overall efficiency of radiation interception and use. Therefore, when it is considered that both maize and beans would be planted in a given area of land, intercropping has more efficient radiation harvests than sole cropping.

The experiment was conducted in the agricultural year 2010, the Municipality of Quatro Pontes/PR. The experimental design was randomized blocks as a factorial 2x2, and an additional treatment that was corn cultivation single, with four replications. The treatments consisted two intercropping systems: corn intercropped with Brachiaria brizantha in the row, and corn intercropped with Brachiaria brizantha in space between two rows, and two times of sowing Brachiaria brizantha: simultaneously corn, and twenty-five days after sowing corn. The seed was planted mechanically in no-tillage system, with spacing between the lines of 0,70 m. The ears were harvested by hand and in the laboratory were evaluated: yield components and productivity. Brachiaria brizantha- MG-4 was sown and harvested manually. We evaluated the production of fresh and dry mass and yield components. For soil analyzes the soil was sampled at 0-0.10 and 0,10-0,20 m. Were determined the total porosity, macroporosity and microporosity. The results demonstrated that the production components of Brachiaria brizantha were lower when it was sown twenty-five days after sowing corn, and between sowing systems when Brachiaria brizantha was sown in line. There was no reduction in grain yield of maize intercropped with Brachiaria system independent and sowing date. The consortium of pasture with corn increased the total porosity, and reduced soil bulk density."

Maize monocrop (with high and low plant density) and maize/cowpea mixed intercrop field experiments were conducted in Kenya to test if intercropping decreased the number of egg batches laid, altered the distribution of the egg batches and influenced egg parasitism. There was no significant difference in the number of egg batches per plant between treatments and the egg batches were randomly distributed on and among plants in most of the plots for all three treatments. There was a tendency for higher egg parasitism in the intercrop. The proportion of eggs parasitized was significantly correlated with total number of eggs per plot suggesting a positive density dependent response. It is concluded that intercropping does not affect C. partellus nor C. orichalcociliellus oviposition behaviour but egg parasitism is likely to be augmented.

Impact of push-pull cropping system on pest management and occurrence of ear rots and mycotoxin contamination of maize in western Kenya	PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						"aflatoxin; ear rots; fall armyworm; fumonisin; push-pull cropping system; stemborer"	"FUMONISIN CONTAMINATION; STRIGA CONTROL; AFLATOXIN; FUSARIUM; TECHNOLOGY; RESISTANCE; CLIMATE; BORER; CORN"	Push-pull involves intercropping of cereals withDesmodiumas a push crop and planting Napier grass/Brachiariaas the pull crop at the border. The technology has been reported to effectively control stemborers, striga weed, and fall armyworm (FAW), and to improve soil nutrition, resulting in increased grain yield. This study evaluated the impact of stemborer and FAW management using this technology on incidence of maize ear rots and preharvest contamination of grains with aflatoxin and fumonisin in western Kenya. The study was conducted during three cropping seasons on maize grown under the push-pull system and as a monocrop. Incidence of stemborer and FAW damage was determined as percentage of damaged plants, while incidence of ear rots was determined as percentage of ears with symptoms. At harvest, fungi were isolated from kernels and aflatoxin and fumonisin were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Stemborer and FAW damage was significantly (p = .001) reduced by over 50% under the push-pull system. There was also a significant (p < .001) reduction in the incidence ofFusarium verticillioides(60%) andAspergillus flavus(86%), which was reflected in a reduced incidence of ear rots (50%) with the push-pull system (p = .001). Fumonisin in maize from push-pull farms was significantly (p = .048) reduced (39%) but the technology had no significant (p > .05) effect on aflatoxin. The study showed that push-pull is an effective strategy for managing maize ear rots and fumonisins, and therefore could play a role in improving food safety among smallholder maize farmers in the region.

This study examines resource use efficiency of maize production among smallholder farmers in Nyando, Kenya. The main objective is to assess the degree of technical efficiency of smallholder farmers and identify the impact of so-called climate smart practices on technical efficiency. The method of Stochastic Frontier Analysis is used to simultaneously estimate a stochastic production frontier and a technical inefficiency effect model. Data for 324 subplots farmed by 170 households were available for this analysis. The study reveals that maize production in Nyando is associated with mean technical efficiency of 45% and that soil conservation practices such as residue management, legume intercropping, and improved varieties significantly increase farmers' technical efficiency. Soil carbon is found to be a critical factor of production. These results imply that there is potential to more than double production using the same resources and that soil conservation practices can be very climate smart, at once increasing soil carbon, production, climate resilience, and technical efficiency.

Oat and white lupin were cultivated in monocultures and mixed cultures with differing oat/white lupin ratios (11% and 33% lupin, respectively). Temporal variation of soil solution chemistry was compared with the mobilization of elements in the rhizosphere of white lupin and concentrations in plant tissues. Relative to the monocrops, intercropping of oat with 11% white lupin significantly increased the concentrations of Fe, Pb, Th, La and Nd in soil solution as well as the concentrations of Fe, Pb, Th, Sc, La and Nd in tissues of oat. Enhanced mobility of the mentioned elements corresponded to a depletion of elements in the rhizosphere soil of white lupin. In mixed cultures with 33% lupin, concentrations in soil solution only slightly increased. We conclude that intercropping with 11% white lupin might be a promising tool for phytoremediation and phytomining research enhancing mobility of essential trace metals as well as elements with relevance for phytoremediation (Pb, Th) and phytomining (La, Nd, Sc) in soil.

'Ruiru 11'. Significant (P < 0.05) reduction of the initial yields of clean coffee by the maize intercrop systems was observed. Irish potatoes, tomatoes and dry beans intercropping systems did not affect the coffee yields, coffee bean sizes, raw, roast and liquor quality adversely. A non significant coffee yield improvement was noted when the food crops were intercropped at alternate coffee inter-rows than in all the coffee inter-rows. All the intercrops gave positive net economic benefits per hectare per year. Maize planted at alternate coffee inter-rows gave the highest marginal rate of economic return followed by tomatoes in combination with dry beans. It was concluded that, maize was not suitable as an intercrop in young coffee at coffee field establishment stages but Irish potatoes tomatoes and dry beans can be considered.

FIELD INSECT PESTS AND CROP DAMAGE ASSESSMENT OF PIGEON PEA (Cajanus cajan [L.] Huth) GROWN UNDER RATOON AND IN MIXTURE WITH MAIZE	CHILEAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						"Cajanus cajan; Clavigralla spp.; cropping system; ratoon crops; regular crop"	YIELD	The widespread adoption of cropping systems that are sustainable and environmentally friendly is vital for the macroeconomic survival of civilization. Intercropping could ensure stability of insect populations in a system. A 3-yr (2005-2007) field trial was therefore carried out in Nigeria under regular and ratoon crops to evaluate five recently developed pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan [L.] Huth) genotypes (ICPL 87, ICPL 161, ICPL 85063, ICP 7120, and ICPL 87119) from the International Crops Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and one local variety for their relative performance and susceptibility to insect pests. The pigeon pea genotypes were in a mixture with two maize genotypes (Zea mays L., open-pollinated and hybrid) in regular crops for 2 yr (2005-2006) followed by a ratoon crop for 1 yr (2007). Termites (Odontotermes badius), crickets (Gymnogryllus lucens), and variegated grasshoppers (Zonocerus variegatus) were the crop's seedling pests and caused minimal damage. Clavigralla spp. infestations were high at the reproductive stage causing 24% and 29% seed damage in regular and ratoon pigeon pea crops, respectively. Maize slightly suppressed insect pest incidence and damage to pigeon pea pods and seeds but significantly (P < 0.01) reduced grain yield in the regular pigeon pea crops in 2005 and 2006, although not in the 2007 ratoon. The pigeon pea genotypes differed significantly (P < 0.05) in pest incidence at the podding stage in both the regular and ratoon crops and in grain yield (P < 0.01) for the regular crop. Grain yield of the pigeon pea ratoon crops was about 60% of the regular crop. Farmers were recommended to adopt the ICPL 161 and ICPL 87 genotypes based on pest tolerance and high grain yield or as idiotypes in pigeon pea hybridization programs.

The experiment was organized in a factorial scheme (two varieties x two cropping system x with or without A. flavus soil inoculation) with eight treatments carried out in a completely randomized block design with three replications. A. flavus incidence in the plots soil was assessed both before and after soil inoculation. The harvested maize was stored for four months and cobs were sampled in a monthly interval and analyzed for the determination of Fusarium spp. colonization, Penicillium spp. and A. flavus cfu levels, insect pests population size and aflatoxin content. Multi-factorial analysis of variance and linear regression analyses with dummy variables were used to compare treatments. The concentrations of aflatoxin B 1 and B 2 in the kernels tended to increase with time during storage. Variety and fungal inoculation were the main factors influencing the levels of aflatoxins in stored maize. The improved variety showed a higher number of A. flavus cfu and aflatoxin B 1 and B 2 levels as compared to the local variety. Intercropping with Vigna unguiculata decreased the aflatoxin concentration in the improved variety but not in the local variety. The local variety had higher levels of Penicillium spp. and lower levels of Fusarium spp. than the improved variety. The treatments had no effect on the populations of the most common storage insect pests, but their levels were positively correlated with aflatoxin content. Both the initial inoculum level and the variety effect on the water content of the kernels after harvest played a significant role in A. flavus infection.

J	"BENJAMIN, LR; AIKMAN, DP"				"BENJAMIN, LR; AIKMAN, DP"			PREDICTING GROWTH IN STANDS OF MIXED-SPECIES FROM THAT IN INDIVIDUAL-SPECIES	ANNALS OF BOTANY			English	Article						"CABBAGE; CARROT; COMPETITION; INTERCROP; LIGHT; MECHANISTIC MODEL; TEMPERATURE; CANOPY ARCHITECTURE"	"SIMPLE-MODEL; LIGHT INTERCEPTION; WEED COMPETITION; YIELD LOSSES; PLANT; CROP; WHEAT; DENSITY; DESIGNS; AVENA"	The growth of spring cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata L.) and carrot (Daucus carota L.) in mixed species stands is compared with growth curves predicted by two forms of a dynamic competition model, which uses a conductance relationship (Aikman and Scaife, 1993) to allow for the constraints on growth from a set of environmental variables. While a plant is isolated, light interception is assumed to occur within a zone whose area is a function of plant weight. Lateral foliage expansion is constricted when the available space is filled. One form of the model assumes that all plants are of similar height (Aikman and Benjamin, 1994). The second form assumes the crown zones are in separate vertical layers, allowing greater lateral expansion in each layer but imposing shading on the underlayer. Parameter values of the model were estimated from the growth within even-aged monocrops. The first form of the model gave the best prediction of growth in the intercrops, often producing a close agreement between observed and predicted weights. Only at the highest density used, 0.05 m spacing, did the different height form of model give a better prediction of growth. Many mixed species stands may be approximated by one or other of the forms of the model, and the relevant form can easily be calibrated from the growth observed in monocrops. Hence, simple models may be sufficiently accurate to predict growth in mixed species systems such as intercrops, or crops and weeds.

NSH-33 hybrid) in pure and mixed stands of identical plant density (35 x 35 cm spacing) was studied in small plot field experiments under drought stress. Decrease in net photosynthetic rate (P(N)) due to interspecific competition was not statistically significant in either species in the first part of the growing season. During drought stress, however, P(N) significantly decreased in sunflower, while it hardly changed in C. album in the same (interspecific) competition situation. In pure stands, transpiration rate (E) was lower in C. album than in sunflower and this difference was more pronounced in mixed stands. Consequently, C. album showed a very high water use efficiency (WUE) especially in the shade layer, which accounts for a larger part of the canopy in this species. By contrast, WUE in sunflower decreased, especially in the sun layer of the mixed stand. Interspecific competition reduced the total biomass more severely in sunflower than in C album by the end of the growing season. The reduction was especially remarkable in the biomass of the reproductive organs. Reproductive effort expressed as reproductive allocation was higher in C album than in sunflower. Hence the reproductive effort in sunflower and C album in both intra- and interspecific competition seemed to be correlated with WUE, which is a prime characteristic of drought stress tolerance.

J	"Phiri, AT; Njira, KOW"				"Phiri, Augustine Talababie; Njira, Keston Oliver Willard"			Grain Legume-Based Cropping Systems' Effects on Soil Organic Carbon and Nutrient Dynamics	AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	"Article; Early Access"						"Cowpea; Legume cropping systems; Maize; Pigeon pea; Soil fertility"	"PHOSPHORUS UPTAKE; WHEAT; CROPS; PREFERENCES; MANURE"	Grain legumes form an important component for Malawi and other southern African countries' agricultural systems. They are valued mostly for their contributions to food security and soil fertility improvement. Smallholder farmers grow these legumes in diversified cropping systems whose effects on soil organic carbon and nutrient dynamics are not fully tested. Therefore, a field experiment was carried out to evaluate the effects of grain legume-based cropping systems on soil organic carbon and nutrient dynamics and trends of selected soil chemical properties down the soil profile. The experiment was implemented in Malawi at Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources, in the Crop and Soil Sciences research farm, from 2013/14 to 2015/2016 growing season. The experiment was implemented in 2013 with seven treatments (Sole maize (Zea mays), sole maize + 92 kg N ha(-1) (MZ + 92 N), sole cowpea (Vigna unguiculata [L.] Walp), sole pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan [L.] Millsp), maize + pigeon pea (MZ + PP), maize + cowpea (MZ + CP) and pigeon pea + cowpea (PP + CP) intercrops). In 2017 soil samples were collected at depths of 0-15 cm, 15-30 cm and 30-45 cm from plots superimposed on an already established Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) experiment. The soil samples were then analyzed for nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), available phosphorus (P), soil organic carbon (SOC) and pH. Soil assessment after a 3-year period shows that all legume-based cropping systems significantly improved amounts of NH4+, NO3-, available P and SOC as compared to continuous maize monocrop. The PP + CP intercrop treatment revealed significantly higher (p < 0.001) amount of NH4+ by 257.7% and 227.4% than those for MZ and MZ + 92 N, Furthermore, the PP + CP intercrop showed significantly higher (p < 0.001) amount of NH4+ than all the other legume-based cropping systems by a range of 42.2-56.9%, over sole pigeon pea and cowpea + maize intercrop, respectively. The trends were similar for NO3-, available P and SOC. The nutrients were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the top 30 cm depth than in the lower horizons. However, no significant differences (p < 0.05) on pH were observed among treatments. From this study, it can be noted that the novel legume + legume intercrop involving pigeon pea and cowpea presents superior effects on plant nutrients' benefit and increased SOC even after some years of their previous cropping. Therefore, legume-based systems including legume + legume intercrops can form a good contribution in the quest for achieving sustainable agricultural intensification.

Ecosystem services from smallholder dairy based integrated farming system vis-a-vis double cropping	AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS			English	"Article; Early Access"						"Dairy-based farming system; ecosystem services; cultural services; provisioning services; regulating services; supporting services"	"NATURAL-RESOURCE CONSERVATION; LIVESTOCK SYSTEMS; LIVELIHOOD SECURITY; MIXED CROP; ENERGY USE; MANAGEMENT; SUSTAINABILITY; AGROECOSYSTEM; FARMERS; INDIA"	The focus toward specialized double cropping in the recent past and the resultant stagnant farm productivity, natural resource degradation, improper by-product recycling, and declining resource use efficiency warranted renewed efforts toward dairy-based integrated farming systems (IFS) approach. The small holder dairy-based integrated farming system (IFS) under present study resulted in production of 323% more wheat equivalent yield (27358 kg ha(-1)) and diverse provisioning services (grains, fruits, straw, green fodder, milk) as compared to groundnut-wheat double cropping system. The dairy-based IFS generated 82.7% more net return (2501 US$ ha(-1)year(-1)) with 1.52 benefit cost ratio, resulted in uniform distribution of income throughout the year (US$ 529 to 909 every month) and generated 251% more employment (418 man-days ha(-1)year(-1)) than double cropping. It provided regulating services in the form of improved soil fertility (19% more soil organic carbon), enhanced saturated infiltration capacity, higher carbon sequestration (552%) and was more dependent on indirect and renewable energy sources. The dairy-based IFS recorded more soil biodiversity (earthworm, fungal, and bacterial count) and better nutrient (100 Kg N, 45 Kg P, and 80 Kg K ha(-1) year(-1)), and by-product recycling (20.4 tonnes farm yard manure and 1.98 tonnes farm-compost) vis-a-vis double cropping system (supporting services) besides providing many cultural services. The study concluded that systems transformation through greater crops-livestock integration provides number of provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural services, and leads to sustainable food systems.

J	Oshunsanya, SO				Oshunsanya, S. O.			Spacing effects of vetiver grass (Vetiveria nigritana Stapf) hedgerows on soil accumulation and yields of maize-cassava intercropping system in Southwest Nigeria	CATENA			English	Article						"Alley; Crop yield; Soil physical properties; Soil accumulation; Vetiver grass hedgerows"	TILLAGE	Large losses of soil usually occur under continuous cropping systems in the tropics owing to high rainfall erosivity coupled with predominately weak soil structure. Vetiver grass (V. nigritiana) planted at intervals across slopes could check erosion losses and allow meaningful cultivation of the alleys between vetiver hedgerows. Between 2004 and 2007, studies were conducted at Ibadan in the humid region of Southwest Nigeria to evaluate the effects of vetiver grass hedgerows (VGH) on soil accumulation, bulk density, soil moisture content, infiltration characteristics, crop growth and yields. Plots were planted to cassava intercropped with maize. Treatments consist of a control (no hedgerow) and three VGH at 5 m (8 hedges), 10 m (4 hedges) and 20 m (2 hedges) spacing on 13% slope of farmland. Treatments were laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Measurements of soil physical properties were taken at the center of the control plot and 0.25 m in front of vetiver hedgerows in plots with vetiver. Calibrated metal rods were inserted 0.15 m from the edge of the hedgerows to monitor accumulated soil due to runoff while erosion pins were inserted every 5 m down the slope on control plots to measure the depth of soil removal. Soil accumulation by VGH serving as barriers to trap eroded soil was significantly (p<0.05) affected by the spacing. The average depth of soil accumulated per VGH spaced at 5 m, 10 m and 20 m wide intervals over three years were 32.17, 67.21 and 159.7 mm respectively while depth of soil removed on the control plot was 168.0 mm. Gravimetric moisture content increased with wider alley spacing and infiltration characteristics were improved in the alleys. Mean maize grain yield over the three growing seasons was significantly (p<0.05) higher in vetiver grass alleys of 5, 10 and 20 m than the control by 34.4%, 23.3% and 6.5%, respectively. Cassava tuber yields were higher in vetiver alleys than the control by 1.7 to 4.7% in the first season, 2.8 to 5.1% in the second season and 3.6 to 7.0% in the third season, following the same trend as maize yields. The greater loss of soil under maize and cassava intercropped on plot without vetiver grass resulted in a decrease in the yields of crops as compared to vetiver alley plots. Although crop yields in VGH plots were higher than on the control, areas of land taken out of cultivation by VGH spaced at 5.10 and 20 m wide intervals were 120,60 and 30 m(2) ha(-1), respectively at the end of the third season when the vetiver was 52 months old. Thus, a balance needs to be struck between the number of hedges with respect to slope and the area of land left for cultivation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Grisley, W				Grisley, W			Crop-pest yield loss: A diagnostic study in the Kenya highlands	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEST MANAGEMENT			English	Article						"maize; beans; pest control; Kenya highlands"	FARMERS	Pest yield loss in maize and beans in the Kenya highlands is studied using farmer elicited information. Total losses due to pests in maize and beans were estimated at 57 and 42%, respectively. As a group, insect pests were more important than disease pests. Regression methods were used to test the relationship between crop yield loss and short- and long-term pest control practices. For maize, the short-term control, use of certified seed, was positively associated with yield loss, while labour availability was negatively associated. Seeding rate and use of fertilizer and manure were not significant. For beans, fertilizer use resulted in a lower yield loss while random sowing methods resulted in a higher loss. Labour, manure use and cultivar sown were not significant. Greater intensity of maize/bean intercropping was negatively related to yield loss for both crops.											10	11	11	0	5	TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	LONDON	ONE GUNPOWDER SQUARE, LONDON, ENGLAND EC4A 3DE	0967-0874			INT J PEST MANAGE	Int.

However, the total potential benefits to be derived from the common bean as a source of food and income, its complementarities with non-legume food crops, and significance to the environment are underexploited. Intensification of common bean could provide approaches that offer new techniques to better manage and monitor globally complex systems of sustainable food production. Therefore, this study tried to assess the productivity of common bean bushy varieties when are involved as part of an intercrop with maize (Zea mays L.) in varying agro-ecological zones. The factors evaluated were the cropping seasons/years (S) (2015 and 2016), agro-ecological zones (A) above sea level (lower 843 m, middle 1051 m, upper 1743 m), and cropping systems (C) (sole, intercrop). The data collected were the total biomass, number of pods per plant and seeds per pod, 100-seed weight as yield components, and grain yield. Bean and maize grain yields were used to calculate the partial (P) and total land equivalent ratio (LER). Results indicated that the main effects of S, A, C, and the interaction effects of S x A, S x C, S x A x C were significant on bean grain yields. Interactions of S x A x C were also significant on all measured variables. Results also indicated that continuous intercropping of bean with maize over two cropping seasons resulted in the increase of bean grain yields from 1.5 to 2.3 t ha(-1) in the lower altitude, 2.0 to 2.3 t ha(-1) in the middle altitude, and 1.8 to 2.9 t ha(-1) in the upper altitude. Land utilization advantage of intercrops over monocultures yielded a total LER of 1.58, whereas the average partial land equivalent ratio (PLER) of individual beans was 1.53.

On-farm trials were run from 2012-2015 and farmers were replicates of a randomized complete block design. The trials compared three CA systems against a conventional practice. Yield and net return ha(-1) were determined for maize and legume yield (kg ha(-1)) produced by ridge and furrow tillage, CA dibble stick planting, CA animal traction ripping and direct seeding. The dibble stick, ripline and direct seeding CA systems had 6-18, 12-28 and 8-9% greater maize yield relative to the conventional tillage system, respectively. Rotation of maize with cowpea and soybean significantly increased maize yields in all CA systems. Intercropping maize with cowpea increased land productivity (e.g., the land equivalent ratio for four seasons was 2.01) compared with full rotations under CA. Maize/cowpea intercropping in dibble stick CA produced the greatest net returns (US$312-767 ha(-1)) compared with dibble stick maize-cowpea rotation (US$204-657), dibble stick maize monoculture (US$108-584) and the conventional practice (US$64-516). The net-return for the animal traction CA systems showed that maize-soybean rotations using the ripper were more profitable than the direct seeder or conventional ridge and furrow systems. Agronomic and economic benefits of CA-based cropping systems highlight the good potential for improved food security and agricultural productivity for smallholder farmers.

The reasons for this fact, are economical and social, as well as biological. Bean breeders have always been questioned on their work, because the development of new varieties is usually done in sole crop, but the varieties are grown in either systems. This paper addresses a set of questions that are usually presented to the breeders, in light of the evidence obtained from many trials conducted in Brazil and in the U.S.A.: Will the genotypes bred for sole crop conditions, perform well when grown in intercrop; How different should a genotype be, for cultivation in intercropping compared to genotypes developed for sole crop conditions; Is there a need for special breeding programs for intercropping and How could a breeding program focus the question of multiple (associated) cropping?"

Yields of clean (hulled) coffee were reduced by the maize intercrop by 59-100%. Coffee bean size, and raw, roast and liquor quality were not significantly affected by the potato, tomato and bean intercrops, which gave positive net economic benefits. Potatoes planted between all the coffee rows gave the largest marginal rate of economic return, followed by tomatoes in combination with beans. The technically and economically viable intercrops for coffee were potatoes, tomatoes, beans, and tomatoes in combination with beans.

Previous studies have focused on photosynthetic productivity, whereas carbon allocation could also be one of the major causes of decreased yield. However, carbon distribution remains unclear in partially shaded conditions. In the present study, we applied heterogeneous light conditions (T), and one side of plants was shaded (T-30%), keeping the other side fully exposed to light (T-100%), as compared to control plants that were exposed entirely to full-light (CK). Dry weight, carbon assimilation,C-13 abundance, and transport tissue structure were analyzed to clarify the carbon distribution in partial shading of plants. T caused a marked decline in dry weight and harvest index (HI), whereas dry weight in unshaded and shaded leaves did not differ. Net photosynthesis rate (Pn), the activity of sucrose phosphate synthase enzymes (SPS), and sucrose concentration increased in unshaded leaves. Appropriately, 5.7% of the(13)C from unshaded leaves was transferred to shaded leaves. Furthermore, plasmodesma density in the unshaded (T-100%) and shaded (T-30%) leaves in T was not significantly different but was lower than that of CK. Similarly, the vascular bundle total area of T was decreased.C-13 transfer from unshaded leaves to ear in T was decreased by 18.0% compared with that in CK. Moreover,C-13 and sucrose concentration of stem in T were higher than those in CK. Our results suggested that, under heterogeneous light, shaded leaves as a sink imported the carbohydrates from the unshaded leaves. Ear and shaded leaf competed for carbohydrates, and were not conducive to tissue structure of sucrose transport, resulting in a decrease in the carbon proportion in the ear, harvest index, and ear weight.

It is essential to evaluate the effect of intercropping (i.e., rhizosphere sharing) on fractionated rhizosphere soil P dynamics under the various soil P conditions and legumes, to improve the soil-plant P dynamics in this region. This study aimed to identify the effect of rhizosphere sharing of maize (MZ)/P-mobilizing legumes intercropping on fractionated rhizosphere soil P dynamics and plant P uptake under different P fertilization rates in strongly weathered cropland soil of Tanzania. We conducted 60-day MZ and P-mobilizing legumes intercropping pot experiments under different P-fertilized conditions (0, 50, and 100 kg P ha(-1)) with two legumes (pigeon pea (PP) and groundnut (GN)) by using three different root-separation treatments (no separation (NS) for rhizosphere sharing, nylon mesh separation (MS), and complete separation (CS)), to compare the effect of rhizosphere sharing in one pot. We evaluated the Hedley-fractionated P of rhizosphere soil and plant P uptake in each pot. We found that both P-efficient legumes did not clearly decrease the less labile P (NaOH-P) of rhizosphere soil in no P treatment, while these clearly decreased the less labile P in 100 kg P ha(-1) treatment. It indicates that P-efficient legumes can solubilize the fertilized P but not native less labile P of the soil. The NS treatment increased the labile P of rhizosphere compared with CS by solubilizing the fertilized P, except for MZ/GN intercropping at 50 kg P ha(-1). Relative to CS, MZ/PP intercropping increased the total plant P uptake per pot (20%-40%) under P-fertilized conditions, whereas MZ/GN intercropping decreased it (17%) at 50 kg P ha(-1) or showed no change at 100 kg P ha(-1). MZ/PP intercropping improved P fertilizer recovery efficiency, whereas MZ/GN intercropping did not. Enhanced P use efficiency through intercropping with P-mobilizing legumes is dependent on P-solubilizing characteristics of each P-mobilizing legume.

Here, we reveal that narrow-wide-row planting arrangement in maize-soybean relay-intercropping system increases the dry matter and competitiveness of soybean, increased the RUE of maize and soybean, and compensates the yield loss of maize by substantially increasing the yield of soybean. In this field study, maize was planted with soybean in different planting arrangements (P1, 20:180, P2, 40:160; P3, 60:140, and P4, 80:120) of relay intercropping, all the relay-intercropping treatments were compared with sole crops of maize (SM) and soybean (SS). Results showed that P1 improved the total RUE 3.26 g/MJ (maize RUE + soybean RUE) of maize and soybean in relay-intercropping system. Compared to P4, treatment P1 increased the soybean competition ratio (CR) values (by 55%) but reduced the maize CR values (by 29%), which in turn significantly improved the yield of soybean by maintaining the maize yield. Generally, in P1, soybean produced 82% of SS yield, and maize produced 88% of SM yield, and it achieved the land equivalent ratio of 1.7. These results suggest that by maintaining the appropriate planting distances between maize and soybean we can improve the competitiveness and yield of intercrop species in relay-intercropping system."

A field experiment was conducted at two major finer millet producing areas of northwestern Ethiopia from 2017 to 2018 cropping seasons with the objective of assessing land use efficiency, profitability, and productivity of finger milt in finger millet-legume additive design intercropping. Factorial combinations of two legume crops (haricot bean and lupine) intercropped with finger millet, two planting methods (row and mixed) and three finger millet-legume planting ratios (100%:75%, 100%:50% and 100%:25% of the recommended seed rate of sole crops) were laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Two sole crop finger millets (planted in rows and broadcast) and two sole crop legumes (haricot bean and lupine) were included for comparison purposes. Results revealed that the primary objective of maintaining the full grain yield of finger millet in an intercropping was achieved in finger millet-haricot bean row intercropping at 100:25 (2.68 tone ha-1) and100:50 (2.72 tone ha-1) planting ratios. Average over the three scenarios, the latter cropping system (65%) and finger millet haricot bean intercropping at 100:75 planting ratio (56%) gave significantly higher yield advantage over sole cropping of finger millet and haricot bean separately. Maximum marginal rate of return was observed in finger millet-lupine mixed intercropping (1281%) and finger millet-haricot bean row intercropping (1175%). Thus, it could be concluded that the latter cropping system could be used for improving household food security to smallholder farmers by increasing the productivity of finger millet, land use efficiency, and profitability.

The aim of this study was to investigate shade effects on beans intercropped with maize in terms of plant mass and radiation use. The experimental treatments were two cropping systems (no shading/sole cropping and shading/intercropping) and two row orientations (north-south and east-west). At the top of bean canopies shaded by maize, incident radiation was reduced by up to 90 %. Shading reduced total dry matter of beans by 67 % at the end of the growing season, resulting in yield losses. The dry matter partitioning into leaf and stem (the ratios of leaf and stem to total biomass) was about 50 % higher in intercropping than sole cropping. In contrast, intercropped beans had 40 % lower dry matter partitioning into pod (the ratio of pod to total biomass). Fraction of radiation intercepted by sole-cropped beans steeply increased until canopy closure (0.9) and then slowly decreased, while fraction of radiation intercepted by intercropped beans remained constant between 0.0 and 0.2 throughout the growing seasons. However, intercropped beans had 77 % higher radiation use efficiency (RUE) than sole-cropped beans. In contrast, for maize, no effect of intercropping (shading) was found on growth, partitioning, yield, radiation interception or RUE. Consequently, lower bean yield losses can be attained in association with late shading rather than early shading. This can be controlled by growing crops with different temporal and spatial treatments. As regards row treatment, no effect of row direction was found on growth, partitioning, yield, radiation interception or RUE.

We hypothesized that early-generation testing would be as useful in a maize (Zea mars L.)/bean intercrop as in sole crop for identifying superior bean populations for yield. F-2 to F-5 bulks of six selected crosses and their F-5-derived advanced lines were evaluated in sole crop or intercrop. The F-2 and F-5 bulks were evaluated together in a preliminary trial in one location, while the advanced lines were evaluated with the F(3)s in one location, and with the F(4)s in two locations. Within sole crop, selection of the best three populations, based on F-2 performance, provided 67% of the top advanced lines. The rank correlation between average bulk yield across generations and the average line yield was positive and significant. Within intercrop, selection of the best three populations provided 56% of the top advanced lines. The rank correlation between advanced line yield and bulk yield across generations was positive but not significant. Also, the top three F-2 populations selected in sole crop produced 89% of the top advanced lines in intercrop. Advanced line performance showed a positive significant correlation with mean F-4 bulk performance for grain yield, 100-seed weight and seeds per pod within sc,le crop, while positive significant correlation was seen with pods per plant and seeds per pod in intercrop. Results indicate that F-2 bulk yields can be used to discard the least promising crosses in both cropping systems.

We conducted two experiments, one on a sandy loam and one on a sandy soil in Denmark, with the aim of studying the efficacy of different implement types and strategies. The treatments were employed against mixed stands of perennials after harvest of spring barley in two consecutive years. Time of treatment, cultivation depth and combinations of implements constituted the strategies. Treatment effects were evaluated in the growing season that followed the post-harvest treatments. In the one experiment, repeated tine cultivation caused an 80 -90% annual reduction of the population of mainly Cirsium arvense. With treatments conducted in two consecutive years, the accumulated effects reached 99% control. In the second experiment, power take-off driven implements with rotating weeding devices demonstrated similar control efficacies against a mixed stand composing C. arvense, Tussilago farfara, Elytrigia repens and Artemisia vulgaris. One pass was conducted a week after barley harvest followed by another pass 3 weeks later and ending the strategy with mouldboard ploughing in the succeeding spring. Grain yields did not differ among the treatments in the two experiments as a result of the generally high effectiveness exerted by the control strategies. Especially post-harvest control strategies based on rotating weed devices and mouldboard ploughing appear to be effective solutions against mixed stands of perennials on sandy soils but they do not comply with optimal nutrient management in organic cropping. Therefore, intensive autumn cultivation is only relevant where a perennial weed problem is uncontrollable by other means. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Morrone] genotypes (Taiwan A-146 2.37 and IRI-381) mixed with butterfly pea (Clitoria ternatea L.) legume. The forage was harvested at 75 days of regrowth from elephant grass plots intercropped with butterfly pea legume and ensiled with or without CM at 5% of dry matter (DM) content. Greater gas losses (12 g/kg) and pH (4.2) were observed in the Taiwan A-146 2.37 + butterfly pea silages. The greatest crude protein content was observed in the 'Taiwan A-146 2.37' + butterfly pea silage added with CM (116 g/kg). Silages with additive and those containing IRI-381 had a greater acid detergent fibre content (367 and 366 g/kg, respectively). CM increased the silage DM (221 g/kg), remaining water-soluble carbohydrates contents (26 g/kg) and in vitro digestibility of DM. The aerobic stability was maintained until 45 h after opening the silos. All silages presented a good fermentative profile and were not affected by the relatively large proportion of butterfly pea (>34%) in the ensiled mass as indicated by the reduced contents of butyric acid and ammonia nitrogen. CM reduces total losses, increases DM recovery and improves the nutritional value of silages from mixed elephant grass-butterfly pea legume.	"[Costa, E. R.; Mello, A. C. L.; Guim, A.; Costa, S. B.

Conservation Agriculture (CA) based on minimum soil disturbance, permanent soil cover and crop diversification has been implemented as a strategy to maintain yields while safeguarding the environment. However, less focus has been placed on potential synergistic benefits on nutrition security. Maize-based systems may increase household income through selling but may not lead to proportionate reduction in malnutrition. Crop diversification in CA systems can have a direct impact on the nutritional status of farm households due to improved dietary diversity. Here we assess how the integration of grain legumes, cowpeas and soybeans, in maize-based CA systems either as intercrops or rotational crops affects maize grain yield and stability, total energy yield, protein yield and surplus calories after satisfying the daily requirement per household. The experiments were carried out from 2012 to 2020 (nine consecutive cropping seasons) in six eastern Zambian on-farm communities using 966 observations. Results show that intercropping compromises maize yields with marginal yield penalties of -5% compared to no-till monocropping. However, intercropped yields were more stable across environments. Total system caloric energy and protein yield were highest in intercropping systems due to higher productivity per unit land area owing to the additive contribution of both maize and legumes. Total system caloric energy and protein yield reached yearly averages of 60 GJ ha(-1) and 517 kg ha(-1), respectively, for the intercropping system as compared to 48 GI ha(-1) and 263 kg ha in monocropped maize systems. Tillage-based monocrop resulted in the least stable yields. Our results suggest that intercropping maize with grain legumes in CA systems is a promising option for smallholder farming households to improve dietary diversity, dietary quality and stability of yields thus contributing to sustainable agriculture intensification while maintaining food and nutrition security.

For the clarifying the difference of the canopy structure, which could be related to radiative characteristics, the canopy geometry of mungbean component was estimated by the stereo-image analysis method (SIAM). The investigation was conducted in three cropping systems, i.e. one row mungbean intercropping between maize rows, two rows mungbean intercropping and a mungbean monoculture. First, the coordinates of four points on a leaflet, which determine the long- and short-axes of it, were measured by the analysis of stereo images taken by two digital cameras. Then the coordinates were used to calculate an area of a leaflet and to estimate the azimuth angle and zenith angle of it. Eventually the characteristic of foliage geometry in intercropping system was described by illustrating the spatial distributions of the leaf area, the azimuth angle and the zenith angle. The leaf area and its vertical distribution obtained by the SIAM were so fitted with those measured by the clipping method. These results showed that the SIAM might be applicable to investigate the canopy structure.

Maize-soybean relay strip intercropping has been shown to significantly control the type of soybean root rot that tends to occur in monoculture. However, it is still unknown whether the rhizosphere microbial community participates in the regulation of intercropped soybean root rot. In this study, rhizosphere Fusarium and Trichoderma communities were compared in either healthy or root-rotted rhizosphere soil from monocultured and intercropped soybean, and our results showed the abundance of rhizosphere Fusarium in intercropping was remarkably different from monoculture. Of four species identified, F. oxysporum was the most aggressive and more frequently isolated in diseased soil of monoculture. In contrast, Trichoderma was largely accumulated in healthy rhizosphere soil of intercropping rather than monoculture. T. harzianum dramatically increased in the rhizosphere of intercropping, while T. virens and T. afroharzianum also exhibited distinct isolation frequency. For the antagonism test in vitro, Trichoderma strains had antagonistic effects on F. oxysporum with the percentage of mycelial inhibition ranging from 50.59-92.94%, and they displayed good mycoparasitic abilities against F. oxysporum through coiling around and entering into the hyphae, expanding along the cell-cell lumen and even dissolving cell walls of the target fungus. These results indicate maizesoybean relay strip intercropping significantly increases the density and composition proportion of beneficial Trichoderma to antagonize the pathogenic Fusarium species in rhizosphere, thus potentially contributing to the suppression of soybean root rot under the intercropping.

Maize (Zea mays L., cv Pioneer 3859) and nodulating soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill, cv. Maple Arrow) inoculated with Bradyrhizobium, or maize and a non-nodulating soybean (Evans x L66-70) were grown in a clay soil, previously fumigated with methyl bromide. The plants were either fertilized with 0%, 50% or 100% of the recommended P-fertilizer level, as controls, or were inoculated with the endomycorrhizal fungus Glomus intraradices Schenck and Smith. The N-15-dilution method was used to assess N-transfer from soybean to corn. Non-mycorrhizal maize and soybean plants did not respond to P fertilization. However, non-P-fertilized plant dry mass and P concentration increased by over 100% following inoculation with the mycorrhizal fungus. In the presence of the endophyte, K concentrations of maize and soybean were increased, and the concentrations of N and Zn in soybean were decreased. According to the Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System (DRIS), inoculation with G. intraradices changed the order of nutrient requirement of maize, by lessening the P deficiency at the expense of the plant N status, and improved the balance of nutrients in both maize and soybean. The N-15-dilution method gave no evidence of N transfer between soybean and maize plants, even in the mycorrhizal plots, where the fungus increased the legume N2-fixation rate by 55%. However, in a four-member association (grass and legume plants, diazotrophic and mycorrhizal endophytes), the reliability of the N-15-dilution method appears questionable.

This field study investigated the productivity of seed blended crops of oats and canola under different seed ratios (80:20, 60:40, 40:60, 20:80 and 50:50%), while their solitary crops were kept for comparison. The agronomic yield attributes, forage biomass and nutritional quality were taken as response variables. The yield attributes of oat in intercropping decreased significantly (p <= 0.05) in comparison to the monoculture. Green forage yield and dry matter biomass of component crops decreased with the reduction of their seed proportion in mixtures. However, the maximum productivity (92 t ha(-1)) of intercropping system was noted for oat and canola sown in 60:40 seed blending ratio, which was closely followed by 80:20 seed proportion. The crude protein (p <= 0.01) and total ash (p <= 0.05) contents of mixed forage were improved with increased share of canola seed in binary mixtures, while the pure stand of canola yielded the highest quality forage. However, seed blending of oat and canola in 60:40 seed proportion may be preferred owing to higher productivity (19%) and improved nutritional quality of mixed forage.

T-1-guinea grass + soybean, and T-1-green panic grass + soybean in completely randomized block design. Growing crossbred heifers (10; Jersey x Red Sindhi) of age 7-10 months with average body weight of 58-65 kg were divided on the basis of weight in above 2 treatment groups. The grasses along with soybean fodder were harvested fresh and evaluated for green and dry biomass production. The green and dry matter productions were 35.17 +/- 0.82 and 7.47 +/- 0.16 t/ha in guinea grass + soybean and 29.87 +/- 0.78 and 5.94 +/- 0.14 t/ha in green panic grass + soybean respectively. The herbage mixtures were chaffed, mixed and fed to the animals. Chemical composition of the herbage mixtures, dry-matter intake, nutrients digestibility and growth performance, in animals were estimated. Guinea grass + soybean produced significantly (P<0.05) higher green and dry biomass. The crude protein content in both the herbage mixtures was ranging 10.78 to 11.43%. Green panic grass+ soybean mixture had higher ether extract content and gross energy than other herbage mixture. The herbage mixtures had higher total ash content reflecting the higher mineral status. Green panic grass + soybean contained lower contents of ADF, cellulose, lignin and silica and higher content of calcium as compared to guinea grass + soybean. The dry-matter intake (DMI) kg/100 kg body weight was significantly higher in group T-2 (3.176 +/- 0.11) than group T, (2.882 +/- 0.08) herbage mixture. The digestibility coefficients of CP, CF, ADF, hemicellulose and cellulose in group T 2 were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than group T-1. The DCP and TDN in groups T-1 and T-2 were 6.74 +/- 0.16 and 52.81 +/- 0.76 and 7.66 +/- 0.11 and 54.04 +/- 0.85%, respectively. Positive nitrogen balance in both the groups indicated that both the herbage mixtures were able to support maintenance and modest growth requirements in the experimental heifers. There was no significant difference in growth rate (368.06 +/- 49.45 and 398.66 +/- 38.11 g/head/day) of animals between the treatments. Green panic grass + soybean herbage mixture was more nutritious than the guinea grass + soybean herbage mixture for animals, however, the green and dry biomass production was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in guinea grass + soybean. Therefore, it can be inferred from the experiment that perennial grasses can be transplanted and intercropped with legume fodders in wastelands for higher biomass yield and quality fodders for the animals."

Evaluation of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) live mulch at different spacings for weed suppression and yield response of maize (Zea mays L.) in southwestern Nigeria	CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						"weed control; arable crop; live mulch; tropics"	"COMPETITION; GROWTH"	The use of living plants for ground cover management in food crops is very recent in spite of the fact that food crop production in chemically killed sod has been practiced for years. A randomized complete block field experiment was conducted over 2 years to evaluate the influence of sweet potato live mulch at different intra row spacings (60 cm x 25 cm, 60 cm x 50 cm and 60 cm x 75 cm) on weed suppression and yield response of maize in southwestern Nigeria. Hoe-weeding once at 3 and 7 weeks after planting was included in the experimental set-up as the standard cultural weed control practice. Results indicated that all the spacing regimes tested significantly (P<0.05) suppressed weed growth and increased grain yield over the unweeded sole maize. Regressing weed growth parameters (Y) against decreasing intra row spacing expressed as increasing plant population density of the sweet potato intercrop (X) showed highly significant (P <= 0.001) negative relationships. Of the treatments tested, maize plus sweet potato at 60 cm x 25 cm and weeding once at 3 and 7 weeks after planting (WAP) produced the highest yields, but bearing in mind the economics of labour input, weed control and yield, maize plus sweet potato at 60 cm x 50 cm would appear to be the most promising of all the treatments. The results of this study further confirm the potential of sweet potato as a suitable crop for use as live mulch that can be effectively exploited for weed suppression and improved growth and yield responses in maize, (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Legumes used as green manures may aid in overcoming soil nutrient depletion and lack of fodder. Relay-cropped mucuna (Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC. var. Utilis (Wright) Bruck) and lablab (Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet cv. Rongai) were evaluated as alternatives to dry season, natural fallow for sustaining soil productivity in a maize (Zea mays L.)-common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) intercrop on farmers' fields in northwestern Kenya. Four treatments were the factorial combinations of the two legumes and two levels of legume defoliation (none, or herbage above 10 cm removed prior to incorporation of remainder). Three controls were cattle manure (5 Mg ha(-1)), inorganic N (30 kg ha(-1)), and natural fallow. Undefoliated mucuna (UD-M) yielded more biomass (2.3 Mg ha(-1), mean of two seasons) than undefoliated lablab (UD-L; 0.8 Mg ha(-1)) under the relay intercrop, contributing more nutrients to succeeding maize than lablab. Defoliation of the legume green manures removed on average 0.9 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) of high quality top-canopy herbage. Nitrogen contribution ranged from 6 kg ha(-1) for defoliated lablab (D-L) to 65 kg ha(-1) for UD-M. Maize grain yield was greater (P = 0.003) following incorporation of mucuna vs. lablab in both seasons. Defoliation of legume residues prior to incorporation decreased subsequent maize grain yield (3.19 vs. 2.49 Mg ha(-1) following mucuna; 2.28 vs. 1.92 Mg ha(-1) following lablab). Relative to the natural fallow control, UD-M, defoliated mucuna (D-M), and UD-L resulted in 52, 34, and 14% increases in subsequent maize grain yield. In conclusion, relay cropping green manure legumes, particularly mucuna, has potential to increase subsequent maize grain yield even when some of the fodder is used as livestock feed."

The system involved growing improved cowpea varieties with maize in a 2 cereal: 4 cowpea row to row (arrangement), with application of inorganic and organic fertilizer to the crops and 2 to 3 insecticide sprays to cowpea. The result indicated that the improved cropping systems using improved varieties of cowpeas were superior to the traditional system. The economic value of grain of the improved system averaged 313, 269 and 308% of the traditional systems in 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively. The improved systems also produced better quality crop residues with increase in the leguminous portion of the residues and therefore improve productivity of the livestock. Farmers' cooperatives societies were vital in procurement of inputs, accessing bank loans and loan recoveries and in subsequent farmer to farmer diffusion of both improved varieties and cropping systems. Participatory on-farm evaluation of improved cowpea varieties and improved cowpea-sorghum and cowpea-maize intercrop systems has led to rapid farmer to farmer diffusion and adoption of the new technologies.

For boosting physico-chemical properties of soil from 2012 to 2015, three legumes including cowpea, cluster bean and soybean were intercropped with sorghum in 40-60, 75-25 and 100-100 seed blending ratios, while pure stand of sorghum was kept for comparison. Correlation studies were also conducted to determine linear or inverse relationship between physiological and agronomic attributes with green forage yield of sorghum. Results revealed that intercropping systems were not effective in significantly improving the physical properties of soil, however soybean and sorghum mixed seeded crop in 100-100 seed ratio resulted in the highest total and available nitrogen especially during last two years of the study and it was followed by mixed seeded crop of cluster bean and sorghum (100-100 seed ratio), while pure stand of sorghum appeared to be the most exhaustive farming system. Correlation analysis depicted a linear relationship between all agronomic attributes (seedling count, plant population at harvest, plant height, stem diameter, number of leaves and leaf area per plant, fresh and dry weights per plant) and physiological growth parameters (leaf area index and leaf area duration, crop growth rate and net assimilation rate) with forage yield of sorghum. Thus, legumes inclusion was found to be effective in restoring soil fertility, while long term legumes inclusion by following rotation may be suggested.

Poir) may increase the use efficiencies of growth resources and reduce fertilizer N requirements. The objectives of this study were to determine (i) row configuration and (ii) fertilizer N effects on yield, protein content, and the land equivalent ratio (LER) of barley-pea intercropping systems. A 3-yr barley-pea intercropping study was conducted at the Western and Central Agricultural Research Centers (WARC and CARC) of Montana State University from 2000 to 2002 with three row configurations (4 rows barley X 4 rows pea, 2 rows barley X 2 rows pea, and barley-pea mixed within rows) and three N application treatments (0, 67, and 134 kg N ha(-1)). Barley biomass production increased 41% at WARC and CARC, whereas pea biomass production decreased 34% at WARC and 46% at CARC with the row configuration changing from the 4 X 4 to the mixed configuration. The LER ranged from 1.05 to 1.24 on a biomass basis and from 1.05 to 1.26 on a protein basis, indicating a production advantage of intercropping. Barley is a more competitive component than pea. Separated row arrangements are advantageous where the desired outcome is a greater pea component in the harvested forage, but the mixed arrangement has a greater total biomass yield and LER. Fertilizer N increased total biomass yield and protein level in barley-pea intercrops, but high N rates could decrease the LER and result in toxic levels of nitrate in the forage.

Therefore, conservation agriculture (CA) has been proposed as an alternative to improve soil fertility and productivity. Hence the aim was to investigate the effects of tillage systems, fertilization, and cropping patterns on selected soil chemical properties (pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, extractable phosphorus, exchangeable cations, and cation exchange capacity) and identify which cropping pattern maximizes stover and grain maize-legume productivity and land use. A two-year (2016/17-2017/18) field experiment in a loamy sand soil was conducted at Nhacoongo Research Station, southern Mozambique. Two tillage systems (conservation (CA) and conventional tillage (CT)), two fertilization treatments (fertilized and unfertilized), and seven cropping patterns (four sole crops and three maize-legume intercrops) were evaluated in a randomized complete block design with split-split plot arrangement and replicated four times. CA practices resulted in significantly higher soil chemical properties and increased stover and grain yields as compared to CT practices, but fertilization demonstrated insignificant effects on soil chemical properties and significant influences on stover and grain yield of maize and legumes. Cropping patterns induced no significant effect on soil chemical properties and either stover or grain yield. Estimated indices like land equivalent ratio (1.18-2.67) and competitive ratio index (0.01-1.72) confirmed the advantage of intercropping against sole cropping. This is largely supported by the estimated values of aggressivity and relative crowding coefficient. Smallholder farmers can therefore benefit by adopting CA.

This study relates to results concerning the second issue: experiments were conducted on irrigated maize in 1991, 1992, and 1993 on the Experimental Farm at La Cote Saint-Andre, France, in the heart of one of the most important agricultural zones between the French Alps and the Rhone Valley. The dynamics of soil and fertilizer N (NO3- transport and N balance during cropping acid intercropping periods) were eoafinuousiv monitored using N-15 isotopic tracing and the tensio-neutronic method (i.e., continual measurement of soil water balance using a neutron moisture meter and tensiometers), together with porous suction cups installed at 0.3-, 0.5-, and 0.8-m depths. Water drainage and leaching of NO3--N, with a partition between that derived from fertilizer and that produced by soil mineralization, were thus obtained during and after the crop cycle. The balance of the labeled fertilizer at harvest was also determined by conventional soil coring and plant sampling. The two methods were used successfully during the 3 yr in which there were different climatic conditions and different fertilizer application rates. The results show that the traditional fertilizer input in the area (260 kg N ha(-1)) could be reduced nearly 30% without any substantial loss in grain yield but with a considerable reduction of nonpoint source pollution due to NO3- leaching. It is also shown that with the combined use of the two methods, it is possible to characterize separately fertilizer-N uptake, fertilizer-N leaching, and N immobilization and to estimate N-gaseous losses.

Merr.] yield formation in the maize-soybean relay strip intercropping (IS) and monoculture soybean (SS). A field experiment was conducted to explore the soybean yield increase mechanism of DA-6 in IS and SS treatments. In this 2-year experiment, compact maize Denghai 605 and shade-tolerant soybean Nandou 25 were selected as cultivated materials. DA-6 with four concentrations, i.e., 0 mg/L (CK), 40 mg/L (D40), 60 mg/L (D60), and 80 mg/L (D80), were sprayed on soybean leaves at the beginning of flowering stage of soybean. Results showed that DA-6 treatments significantly (p < 0.05) increased soybean grain yield, and the yield increase ratio was higher in IS than SS. The leaf area index values and net photosynthesis rate of IS peaked at D60 and were increased by 32.2-49.3% and 24.1-27.2% compared with the corresponding CK. Similarly, DA-6 treatments increased the aboveground dry matter and the amount of soybean dry matter accumulation from the R1 stage to the R8 stage (VDMT) and highest at D60 both in IS and SS. D60 increased the VDMT by 29.0-47.1% in IS and 20.7-29.2% in SS. The TRG at D60 ranged 72.4-77.6% in IS and 61.4-62.5% in SS. The MDA content at D60 treatment was decreased by 38.3% in IS and 25.8% in SS. The active grain-filling day in IS was about 7 days longer than in SS. In D60 treatment, the V-mean and V-max increased by 6.5% and 6.5% in IS and 5.7% and 4.3% in SS compared with the corresponding CK. Although the pod number and hundred-grain weight were significantly (p < 0.05) increased by DA-6 treatments, the grains per pod were maintained stable. The pod number and hundred-grain weight were increased by 30.1-36.8% and 4.5-6.7% in IS and 6.3-13% and 3.6-5.6% in SS. Thus, the grain yield at D60 was increased by 36.7-38.4% in IS and 21.7-26.6% in SS. DA-6 treatments significantly (p < 0.05) increased soybean grain yield and peaked D60 treatments both in IS and SS.

J	Kwabiah, AB				Kwabiah, AB			Biological efficiency and economic benefits of pea-barley and pea-oat intercrops	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE			English	Article						"barley; forage yield; land equivalent ratio; oat; pea; seeding rate"	"NITROGEN YIELD; MIXTURES; FORAGE; CEREALS; NEWFOUNDLAND; ADVANTAGES; LEGUMES; PLANT; RATIO"	To optimize use efficiency of production resources, Newfoundland (NL) dairy farmers intercrop barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and oat (Avena sativa L.) with field pea [Pisum sativum subsp. sativum var. arvense (L.) Poir.]. An experiment was conducted in 2000 and 2001 in a temperate sandy loam to determine seeding rate complementarity of barley and oat in pea-barley and pea-oat intercrops for forage and nitrogen (N) yields. The monocultures of barley and oat were each sown at 85 and 170 kg ha(-1), and pea was sown at 150 kg ha(-1). For pea-barley and pea-oat intercrops, pea was sown at 150 kg ha(-1) and each cereal component was sown at 85 and 170 kg ha(-1). The nine treatments were referred to, respectively, as pea(150), barley(85), oat(85), barley(170), oat(170), pea(150)-barley(85), pea(150)-oat(85), pea(150)-barley(170), and pea(150)-oat(170). The land equivalent ratio (LER), defined as the relative land area under monoculture that is required to produce the yields achieved in intercropping, and its analogues were used to compare biological efficiency and economic benefits that pea-cereal intercrops had over monocultures. There were no significant effects of year and year H treatment interactions on forage and N yield. Barley(170) gave the highest forage yield, N yield and net return. Oat(85) gave the lowest forage and N yield, and pea(150)-oat(85) gave the lowest net return. Mixing pea with barley or oat significantly reduced the yields of all three component crops relative to the monoculture crop. Reduction in both forage and N yields of pea due to intercropping ranged from 40% in pea(150)-oat(85) to 48% in pea(150)-oat(170). Doubling the seeding rate of barley from 85 to 170 kg ha(-1) reduced land advantage in terms of both forage and nitrogen (N) yield, although among the intercrops, pea(150)-barley(170) was the most profitable in forage and N yield, and net economic return. As a result, pea(150)-barley(85) gave the highest land advantage in terms of forage yield and pea(150)-oat(170) gave the highest land and monetary advantage in terms of forage yield and forage N yield.

We analyze plot level adoption decisions of SIPs by male, female or joint plot managers within the household, controlling for household characteristics, asset wealth and land quality factors that condition investments in intensification options. Using a multivariate probit model, we find gender differences in the adoption pattern for some SIPs. Compared to male plot mangers, female managers are less likely to adopt minimum tillage and animal manure in crop production, indicating the existence of certain socioeconomic inequalities and barriers for female farmers. However, we find no gender differences in the adoption of soil and water conservation measures, improved seed varieties, chemical fertilizers, maize-legume intercropping, and maize-legume rotations.

A survey of 120 farmers from four maize- and sorghum-growing districts of eastern Ethiopia was carried out in 2014 to study common management practices of cereal stem borers. Drought, pests, and land shortage were reported as the main constraints to maize and sorghum production in the area. Stem borers were perceived as the most important pests in these crops. The estimated yield losses from stem borers ranged from 10% to 50%. The majority of the farmers reported not using chemical insecticides to control these pests due to lack of capital, unavailability, and lack of knowledge. Moreover, most farmers were not using improved maize varieties. Cultural practices were found to be the most promising control method of cereal stem borers. Despite differences among districts, farmers practiced crop rotation, intercropping, manipulation of planting dates, crop residue disposal, and post-harvest tillage as common control strategies, even though a considerable proportion of the farmers was not implementing these practices sufficiently. The design of appropriate strategies for stem borer management based on farmers' needs and priorities should be promoted.

Eight Holstein cows paired by parity and date of calving were used in a split-plot experiment to evaluate supplementing 6 kg DM/cow/d of oat-vetch silage (OVS) in comparison to maize silage (MS) as dry season feeding, for a more intensive use of the land through an oat-vetch catch crop. Cows had 9 h/d access to continuous grazing of perennial ryegrass - white clover pasture and 4 kg/d of commercial concentrate. The 9 week experiment, recorded weekly milk yield and composition, and body condition score and live-weight every fortnight. Milk yield was 20.1 kg/cow/d for OVS and 15.4 for MS (SEM +/- 2.9, P > 0.05), with no differences for fat or protein content, body condition score, or live-weight (P > 0.05). The economic analysis showed that although feeding costs were higher for OVS, margins were greater than for MS, with feeding cost per litre of $0.21 for MS and $0.16 for OVS. OVS is a viable catch crop after the MS harvest that can substitute MS in the dry season enabling a more intensive use of the land.	"[Arriaga-Jordan, C.

When grown in a mixed stand the extremely low intensity of transpiration in A. chlorostachys resulted in a difference in the water use efficiency (WUE) values of net photosynthesis between the two species. The values were higher in A. chlorostachys. Interspecific competition reduced the total individual plant weight to a greater extent in sunflower than in the weed species by the end of the growing season. Reproductive effort was higher in A. chlorostachys than sunflower and, in our opinion, best reflects the outcome of competition. On the basis of the correlation between WUE and reproductive allocation, reproductive effort in sunflower and A. chlorostachys in both intra- and interspecific competition is determined by the value of WUE, which latter is also of prime importance in drought stress tolerance.

This study aimed to compare the farm economic margins (FEM) of different maize-based smallholder farming systems (MSFSs) in the Senqu River Valley (SRV) and provide recommendations on farming systems that can be employed to improve the FEM for household income improvement. The Olympe software was used to model and simulate the FEM of the different MSFSs and SWOT-TOWS analysis was used to devise strategies to increase FEM and improve household income. The findings revealed that there was high FEM variability within and across the different MSFSs. The identified sources of variance were the cropping patterns, types of intercrops, and the number of animals raised. Poor crop and livestock management also played a role in the FEM variability, hence the poor performance of some MSFSs. The findings further indicated that MSFSs with high-value intercrops such as pumpkins had higher FEM than their monocropping counterparts. Then, again, MSFSs with both crops and livestock had the highest FEM. Therefore, identified strategies like crop diversification and livestock integration could be recommended for use by farmers, not only in this zone but also in other zones that share similar environmental conditions.

Integrated technologies that were evaluated include: micro-dose fertilizer, moisture conservation, seed priming, intercropping, and row planting. The experimental design was randomized complete block (RCB) with three replications consisted of 14 treatments. The results revealed that the highest grain yield (5032 and 4328 kg/ha) of sorghum was recorded with application of recommended fertilizer rate + primed seed + tied ridge and micro-dose fertilizer + primed seed + tied ridge + intercropping with haricot bean, respectively. For pearl millet, the highest grain yield (3355 and 3145 kg/ha) was recorded with application of micro-dose fertilizer + dry seed + tied ridge and recommended fertilizer rate + dry seed + tied ridge, respectively. For maize, the highest grain yield (4414 and 4392 kg/ha) was recorded with application of micro-dose fertilizer + primed seed + tied ridge + intercropping mung bean and recommended fertilizer rate + dry seed + tied ridge. From the results of on-station and on-farm trials at Kobo, recommended fertilizer rate + primed seed + tied-ridge for sorghum testing crop, recommended fertilizer rate + dry seed + tied-ridge for pearl millet and micro-dose fertilizer + primed seed + tied ridge + intercropping with mung bean for maize was recommended for kobo and similar areas.

Soybean-Cereal Intercropping Systems as Influenced by Nitrogen Nutrition	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							"CROPPING SYSTEM; PLANTING DENSITY; SEMIARID TROPICS; PEARL-MILLET; COMPETITION; MAIZE; YIELD; CORN; MANAGEMENT; ECONOMICS"	Little is known how to optimize N supply of cereal components in an intercropping system that considers biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) from soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. A 2-yr field experiment was conducted to study the compatibility of soybean-cereals intercropping as influenced by varying N levels to intercropped cereals as per recommended dose of nitrogen (RDN) for respective cereals. Soybean was grown as the main crop with 100% plant population and cereals were intercropped at 2:1 ratio in additive series (without sacrificing main crop population). While the yield of intercropped maize (Zea mays L.) significantly increased up to 100% RDN, the yield of intercropped sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.] and pearl millet [Pennisetum typhoides (Burm.f.) Stapf & C.E. Hubb.] increased only up to 75 and 50% RDN, respectively. The soybean yield reduced by 33.6, 37.9 and 58.3% due to intercropping with maize, sorghum and pearl millet, respectively. The soybean equivalent yield, net return, benefit cost ratio and monetary advantage index were maximum in soybean+maize intercropping provided with 100% RDN to maize. Land equivalent ratio, relative crowding coefficient and intercropping advantage were the greatest with soybean+maize intercropping proving that there was an advantage of intercropping with maize. The aggressivity and competitive ratio were higher for pearl millet and sorghum as compared to maize indicating that pearl millet and sorghum were more competitive to soybean than maize. The study indicated the possibility to reduce N fertilizer requirement by 25 and 50% in case of sorghum and pearl millet as intercrop with soybean, respectively.	"[Layek, J.; Rana, D.

For revealing effects of intercropping and N application on dynamics of DOC concentration and chemical structure, a multi-year located field experiment with cropping patterns (maize monocropping and maize-potato intercropping) subjected to four N levels (0 kg ha-1, 125 kg ha-1, 250 kg ha-1, 375 kg ha-1) was conducted. The results showed that N application raised DOC concentration while DOC accumulation, had a quadratic relationship with N application rate during the entire growth period of maize. At the same N level, intercropping increased the concentration and accumulation of DOC compared with monocropping. Meanwhile N application promoted the contents of amines and aromatic compounds and average molecular weight of DOC molecules, which reached the highest value at rate of 125 kg N ha-1. Compared with monocropping at the same N level, there was a tendency to increase the content of amines and aromatic compounds and the average molecular weight of DOC in intercropping, thus improving the degree of humification and aromatization of soil DOC. Soil temperature, water content and NH4+-N were the main factors mediating DOC concentration, while DOC concentration and soil temperature significantly affected the chemical structure of DOC. The structural equation model showed intercropping and N application elevated soil DOC concentration by increasing soil temperature, litter and root biomass, and the improvement of DOC concentration and soil temperature further enhanced the average molecular weight of DOC, resulting in accumulation of DOC.

The experiments were conducted in Jaboticabal-SP, in a eutrophic red latosol, in the second year of no-tillage system implementation. The IPR 139 cultivar was used in split plot design with three replications, in randomized block. The plots had been composed for three crop systems in the summer season, with maize exclusive, maize intercropped with U. ruziziensis and U. ruziziensis exclusive. The subplots had been constituted for five nitrogen rates (0, 40, 80, 120 and 160 kg ha(-1)), applied as topdressing at V4-4 in irrigated common-bean cultivated in the winter-spring season. The use of U. ruziziensis in crops systems, exclusive or intercropped with maize favors the grass cover crop production sufficiently to total soli surface covered, possibility similar grain yield compared to maize exclusive. The topdressing nitrogen application doesn't affect the common-bean yield in succession to maize and U. ruziziensis intercropped. The increase of nitrogen rates in common-bean in succession to maize exclusive improves the yield, although decreases the agronomic efficiency.

Here we revealed that narrow-wide-row relay-intercropping improves the light interception across maize leaves in wide rows (60cm) and narrow rows (40cm), accelerated the biomass production of intercrop-species and compensated the slight maize yield loss by considerably increasing the soybean yield. In a two-year experiment, maize was planted with soybean in different planting patterns (1M1S, 50: 50cm and 2M2S, 40: 60cm) of relay-intercropping, both planting patterns were compared with sole cropping of maize (M) and soybean (S). As compared to M and 1M1S, 2M2S increased the total light interception of maize leaves in wide rows (WR) by 27% and 23%, 20% and 10%, 16% and 9% which in turn significantly enhanced the photosynthetic rate of WR maize leaves by 7% and 5%, 12% and 9%, and 19% and 4%, at tasseling, grain-filling and maturity stage of maize, respectively. Similarly, the light transmittance at soybean canopy increased by 218%, 160% and 172% at V-2, V-5 and R-1 stage in 2M2S compared with 1M1S. The improved light environment at soy-bean canopy in 2M2S considerably enhanced the mean biomass accumulation, and allocation to stem and leaves of soybean by 168%, and 131% and 207%, respectively, while it decreased the mean biomass accumulation, and distribution to stem, leaves and seed of maize by 4%, and 4%, 6% and 5%, respectively than 1M1S. Compared to 1M1S, 2M2S also increased the CR values of soybean (by 157%) but decreased the CR values of maize (by 61%). Overall, under 2M2S, relay-cropped maize and soybean produced 94% and 69% of the sole cropping yield, and the 2M2S achieved LER of 1.7 with net income of 1387.7 US $ha(-1) in 2016 and 1434.4 US $ha(-1) in 2017. Our findings implied that selection of optimum planting pattern (2M2S) may increase the light interception and influence the light distribution between maize and soybean rows under relay-intercropping conditions which will significantly increase the intercrops productivity. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the light environment when considering the sustainability of maize-soybean relay-intercropping via appropriate planting pattern selection.

In a replacement model, Hordeum vulgare was intercropped with 11% Lupinus albus and 11% Lupinus angustifolius. They were cultivated on two substrates, A (pH = 7.8) and B (pH = 6.6), and treated with 1.5 g P m(-2) or 3 g P m(-2). Simultaneously, a greenhouse experiment was conducted to quantify carboxylate release. There, one group of L. albus and L. angustifolius was supplied with either 200 mu mol L-1 P or 20 mu mol L-1 P. L. albus released higher amounts of carboxylates at low P supply than L. angustifolius, while L. angustifolius showed the opposite response. Plants cultivated on substrate B accumulated substantially higher amounts of nutrients and REE, compared to substrate A. Higher P supply did not influence the leaf and stem P concentrations of H. vulgare. Addition of P decreased REE accumulation in barley monocultures on alkaline soil A. However, when H. vulgare was cultivated in mixed culture with L. angustifolius on alkaline substrate A with high P supply, the accumulation of REE in H. vulgare significantly increased. Conversely, on acidic substrate B, intercropping with L. albus decreased REE accumulation in H. vulgare. Our findings suggest a predominant effect of soil properties on the soil-plant transfer of REEs. However, in plant communities and within a certain soil environment, interspecific root interactions determined by species-specific strategies related to P acquisition in concert with the plant's nutrient supply impact REE fluxes between neighbouring plants.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the operational performance of a planter-tractor set on maize straws intercropped with Urochloa, in different seeding modes. The soybean crop was seed on the intercropping of two forage species (Urochloa brizantha and Urochloa ruziziensis) in five cropping systems: MBL (Maize with Urochloa in the maize seeding row, mixed with base fertilizer and deposited at 0.10 m), MBE (Maize with Urochloa seeded between rows at the same day of seeding maize), MBC (Urochloa between rows of maize seeded with the covering fertilizer at the V-4 stage), MBLA (Maize with Urochloa by broadcast seeding at the V-4 stage) and MS (Single Maize: control). The following variables were evaluated: dry mass of maize straw, dry mass of forages and total dry mass of straw; and for the operational parameters the speed of seeding, wheel slippage, traction force and average power at the drawbar. The results showed that the amount of straw produced by maize intercropping with Urochloa, interferes in the operational performance of the tractor-planter at the operation of soybean seeding, i.e., areas with higher amount of straw promote greater energy demand, as well as higher wheel slippage."

However, little is known on how planting time (co-growth duration) changes the interspecific interaction resulting in a seed-yield difference between intercropping and sole cropping system. Therefore, this field study was initiated to determine the effects of changing co-growth duration on competitive interactions, growth, and yield of intercrop species under MSRI. The sole soybean and relay-cropped soybean were planted on PT1(15-20 May, 90 days of co-growth duration in MSRI); PT2(5-10 June, 70 days of co-growth duration in MSRI); and PT3(25-30 June, 50 days of co-growth duration in MSRI) to generate different size-asymmetric competition between component crops in MSRI. Results showed that sole soybean produced the mean highest (2.93 t/ha) seed yield under PT2, and the mean lowest (2.51 t/ha) seed yield under PT1. However, in MSRI, PT(3)increased the soybean yield by 29.1% and 13.3% compared to PT(1)and PT2, respectively. The PT(3)also increased the maize yield by 7.4% and 2.9% than PT(1)and PT2, respectively, and it reduced the yield differences of maize and soybean between relay intercropping and sole cropping systems. In MSRI, decreased co-growth duration promoted the soybean plants to achieve the higher crop growth rate, and biomass accumulation, which ultimately improved the soybean resilience toward size-asymmetric competition created by maize plants. Furthermore, as compared to PT(1)and PT2, planting time PT(3)significantly increased the competitive ratio (by 10.1% and 17.3%, respectively) of soybean plants. Overall, the PT(3)achieved the average highest land equivalent ratio of 1.63, which is significantly higher than PT1(by 12.3%) and PT2(by 10.6%). In conclusion, this study implied that in MSRI, the determination of proper soybean planting time (co-growth duration) is one of the most critical factors to reduce the competition between the intercrops and to obtain higher crop yields."

Seed weight was plotted against total dry weight to determine harvest index for both crops. For bean the intercept of this relationship for each experiment, with one exception, was not significantly different from zero, so that the dopes of the regressions were the harvest indices. Harvest indices for bean varied more between seasons (0.38-0.85) than from the effects of management practices (0.53-0.71). Over all seasons and treatments, the index for bean did not vary systematically with crop weight, and averaged 0.50. By contrast, a similar analysis for maize over all seasons and treatments, showed that the harvest index varied with crop dry weight, approaching an asymptotic value as dry weight increased. The regression intercepts for the different experiments were significantly different from each other, and in three cases differed significantly from zero. Therefore, although the slopes for the different experiments were parallel, they did not always represent the harvest index.

Moench] in inter-row spaces of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) and at three sowing dates on yield of both crops. Two contrasting cassava cultivars (TMS 30572-early maturing, short with full-branch and dense canopy and Odongbo-late maturing, tall with less-branch and sparse canopy) were evaluated. In the first experiment, okra was sown on 30 July, 20 August and 3 September as a late-season crop in 1999 and on 27 May, 10 June and 24 June as an early-season crop in 2000. In the second experiment, okra was sown on 29 May, 21 June and 12 July as an early-season crop in 2001 and on 13 August, 29 August and 12 September as a late-season crop in 2002. Leaf area index (LAI), days to 50% flowering and first pod harvest, yield and yield components of okra in mixed stands were the same as in monoculture in both experiments. However, cassava Odongbo/okra intercrop resulted in an increase in fresh pod yield and economic returns of okra by 19-21% and 20-26%, respectively, compared with monoculture and cassava TMS 30572/okra intercrop. LAI of okra was significantly increased by 20-45% in the first and second sowing dates, but it took 2-10 days longer for the first and second-sown okra plants to reach 50% flowering and first pod harvest over those of the third-sowing date in any experiment. Mean increase in okra fresh pod yield with first and second sowing dates was 2.4-5.6 t ha(-1) over the third sowing date in either experiment. The mean economic returns with the first and second sowing dates were 105% and 50% in the first experiment and 125% and 50% in the second experiment, respectively, over those of the third sowing date regardless of cropping system. The cassava yields were not affected by cropping system and okra sowing date. For sustainable okra production in wide inter-row spaces of cassava, growing both crops in May for the early-season crops and in early August for the late-season crops and using tall, sparse canopy cassava is recommended.

It not only provides profitable crop productivity for agricultural communities but also plays an important role in improving soil fertility. Therefore, the present research was conducted to assess the effect of the organic and mineral fertilizers on the forage yield and nutritional value in barley-pea intercropping system. The results revealed that the quality of forage grass is significantly influenced by both organic and inorganic fertilizer. Thus, organic fertilizer application has significantly influenced the dry matter (DM), crude ash (CA), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF). Among the treatments, organic fertilizer added at rate of 35 m(-3) ha(-1) produced the maximum fresh and dry matter in barley and peas. In addition, the same level of organic fertilizer also improved silage composition by significantly increasing the protein and fiber content and showed highest the values. Based on overall results, it is concluded that organic fertilizer treatment (35 m(-3) ha(-1)) has the potential as an effective strategy to improve the productivity and nutritional quality of the barley-pea intercropping system in arid areas. The results revealed that organic fertilizer can be utilized in sustainable agricultural as a source of nutrients for numerous various crops under arid conditions.

In this research, the feasibility of wheat-canola intercropping systems under two spatial patterns (row and mixed intercropping) was carried out to evaluate the interaction between the crops and their effects on their productivity. The treatments included sole wheat, sole canola, one wheat row alternating with one canola row, two wheat rows alternating with two canola rows, four wheat rows alternating with four canola rows and mixed intercropping of wheat + canola (broadcast method). Number of lines of wheat and canola were kept same in intercropping treatments as in their pure stand. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cv. sehar-2006 and canola (Brassica napus L.) hybrid Hyola-401 were used as experimental materials. The results revealed that yield and various yield contributing traits of wheat and canola were influenced significantly by different intercropping treatments. The sole crop of wheat and canola gave higher economic yield i.e., 4.02 and 1.47 t ha(-1), respectively. Among intercropping treatments, four rows of wheat alternating with four rows of canola gave higher total land-equivalent ratio (LER) of 1.37, net benefits of Rs. 107492 and benefit cost ratio of 2.76. In this study, row intercropping resulted in consistent over-yielding (LER), and seemed to be enhanced by one to four alternating rows of wheat and canola. Therefore, for higher crop productivity and economic returns, farmers should cultivate wheat-canola in the pattern of four rows of wheat along with four rows of canola.

Intercropping has several advantages and is used in both traditional and sustainable agriculture. The objective of the present study was to study the interactions among different pea and wheat cultivars and the effect of water availability on wheat-pea mixtures and the competition between the two species. The experiment was conducted for two successive growing seasons using two different irrigation regimes and two cultivars from each species. The different treatments were evaluated using morphological and agronomic characteristics. Intercropping treatment, cultivars, and irrigation level affected most of the characteristics that were studied and the competition between the two species. Biomass was higher by 47% and leaf area index by 34% under irrigation compared to the rainfed conditions. The different cultivars showed different response under the two water regimes. Based on the intercropping indices, the mixture 'Yecora E' - 'Isard' is favoured under irrigation while the combination 'Elissavet' - 'Isard' under low water availability. There was interaction between cultivars and irrigation and using different cultivars in intercropping can have higher yield advantage than monocropping by exploiting the environmental resources more efficiently. Therefore, the use of appropriate cultivars in mixtures can affect the growth, biomass yield and competition between the two species leading to higher yield and greater economic return.

The experiment was carried out in an area of Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit.) intercropped with a herbaceous layer having a predominance of tropical grasses (Tifton 85, Andropogon and Guinea). A completely randomised design with four treatments and five replications was adopted. Growing goats were used; the control group being fed only on pasture, and the other groups supplemented with ground maize at 0.5, 0.9 and 1.3% of live weight. Supplementation reduced grazing time and increased rumination and idle time; although the goats spent approximately 85% of the time grazing on grasses, indicating a preference for this forage. Energy supplementation increased the weight gain per animal per unit area. Under a silvopastoral system of leucaena and tropical grasses, goats prefer the grasses, however, grazing on the legume results in a protein intake that justifies additional energy input. The supplementation of goats under a silvopastoral system of tropical grasses and leucaena, with maize as an energy source at a rate of up to 1.3% of live weight, influences feeding behaviour, having a favourable effect on animal performance."

Two experiments were conducted at Giza Agricultural Experiments and Research Station, Faculty of Agriculture, Cairo University, (Egypt) during the two successive seasons 2015 and 2016. The experiment included eighteen treatments which were the combinations between three applied irrigation water (75, 100 and 125% of the recommended water applied) and six cropping systems (50% soybean + 100% corn, 100% soybean + 100% corn, traditional solid corn, solid corn 'mixed system', traditional solid soybean and solid soybean 'mixed system). The experimental design was split plot design with four replications. The data indicated that all the studied soybean characters were affected negatively by intercropping with corn. Increasing soybean plant density under intercropping systems from 50 to 100% of solid culture achieved high seed yield without reduction on corn grain yield. The interaction between levels of irrigation water and cropping systems did not affect soybean characters; meanwhile the reverse was true for corn crop. WUE was increased with decreasing irrigation water levels from 125 to 75% of the recommended irrigation water (8092 m(3)/ha). It is be concluded that intercropping soybean with corn in beds 140 cm increased LER and WUE, as well as, total economic return than solid cultures under recommended level of applied irrigation water of solid crops"	"[Metwally, Abd El-Alim Abdel-Rhman; Safina, Sayed Ahmed; Saleh, Neama Abd El-Salheen] Cairo Univ, Dept Agron, Fac Agr, Giza, Egypt; [El-Killany, Rushdy] Cairo Univ, Soil Dept, Fac Agr, Giza, Egypt"		Metwally, AAR (corresponding author), Cairo Univ, Dept Agron, Fac Agr, Giza, Egypt.	drabdmetwally.agric@hotmail.com	Safina, Sayed/AAD-8732-2019		"Cairo University, Faculty of Agriculture, Agronomy department; Cairo University, Agriculture Research Center"	"Cairo University, Faculty of Agriculture, Agronomy department; Cairo University, Agriculture Research Center"	The authors are grateful for Cairo University, Faculty of Agriculture, Agronomy department and Agriculture Research Center for financial support to carry out this study		24	0	0	0	4	INNOVATIVE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION & SERVICES NETWORK	FAISALABAD	INNOVATIVE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION & SERVICES NETWORK, FAISALABAD, 00000, PAKISTAN	1811-9506	2218-3973		BIOSCI RES	Biosci.

In all 12 intercropping systems in 2:1 ratio of soybean + maize, soybean+sorghum and soybean+pearl millet with 4 levels of RDN to cereal component crops along with sole soybean were carried out in a randomized block designand replicated thrice. The performance of soybean was greatly influenced by the intercrops as well as N levels. The sole crop of soybean recorded higher number of branches, drymatter accumulation, root biomass; leaf area index, crop growth rate and relative growth rate as compared to soybean grown in intercropping systems. Likewise the yield attributes, yield and harvest index were also higher with sole soybean. Among the intercropping systems, soybean+pearl millet had greater negative impact on performance of soybean as compared to soybean+maize and soybean+sorghum system. The increase in N levels to cereal crops in intercropping systems showed negative impact on the growth and yield attributes, and yield of soybean. The 100% RDN to intercropped cereals had the highest negative effect while the control had the least. The highest gross returns, net returns, B: C ratio and soybean equivalent yield (SEY) were observed under soybean+maize intercropping system along with 100% RDN to intercropped maize in both the years of experimentation. Among the intercropping systems, soybean+maize intercropping systems recorded higher returns and SEY than others."	"[Layek, J.; Shivakumar, B.

EFFECTS OF CROP GEOMETRY AND NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT ON NUTRIENT UPTAKE AND QUALITY PARAMETERS OF POTATO UNDER WINTER MAIZE plus POTATO INTERCROPPING SYSTEM	BANGLADESH JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						"Nutrient uptake; Protein; Starch; Vermicompost; Poultry manure"		Effects of crop geometry and nutrient management on nutrient uptake and quality parameters of potato under winter maize + potato intercropping system were studied during two consecutive years (2015-2016 and 2016-17) at BHU, Varanasi, India. Results revealed that under different crop geometry the nutrient uptake (NPK kg/ ha) were obtained significantly higher with 1 : 2 row ratio in additive series as compared to other row ratio due to maximum plant population. The minimum nutrient uptake (NPK kg/ha) were obtained with 1:1 row ratio in replacement series. However, quality parameters (protein and starch) did not vary significantly by different crop geometry during both the years of investigation. Amongst nutrient management, the highest nutrient uptake (NPK kg/ ha) and quality parameters (protein and starch) were obtained significantly with the application of 100% RDF + 25% N through poultry manure followed by the application of 100% RDF + 25% N through vermicompost. Thus, the results suggest that 1:2 row ratio (crop geometry) in additive series with 100% RDF + 25% N through poultry manure (nutrient management) followed by 100% RDF + 25 % N through vermicompost were feasible and practicable during both the years of investigations.

Fallow management systems consisted of natural bush, Leucaena leucocephala hedgerows and Pueraria phaseoloides fallow. Frequencies of cropping were continuous cropping, 1 cropping year alternating with 1, 2 and 3 years of uncropped fallow. Shrubs and climbers contributed 60-70% and herbs (predominantly weeds) 30-40% to the total dry matter produced in all treatments. Weed dry matter and seedbank increased with time in all treatments but was higher in natural bush fallow by the fifth and sixth years and in continuously cropped plots. Weed seed density increased with time in the continuously cropped plots and in plots cropped after 1 or 2 years of fallow but decreased with time when the fallow period was up to 3 years. Maize grain yield decreased over time in both unweeded and weeded plots irrespective of treatment with the exception of the weeded P. phaseoloides fallow treatment. Cassava tuber yield decreased over time in unweeded plots in all treatments while tuber yield increased in weeded P. phaseoloides fallow treatment and remained relatively constant in L. leucocephala and natural bush fallow plots. The results from this study suggest that planted fallow involving legume species is more effective in weed management in the long term than natural fallow. Fallow period was beneficial to crop yield and yield improvement increased with the length of the fallow cycle, particularly for cassava.

The addition of a winter annual cereal crop to the corn stover system could increase potential ethanol yield by adding harvestable biomass. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential bioethanol yield resulting from the harvest of mixed stands of corn stover interseeded with winter cereals. The winter cereal crop factor consisted of three treatments; cereal rye (Secale cereale L.), triticale (Triticale hexaploide Lart.), and no winter cereal crop (control). The harvest time factor consisted of two treatments; a two-harvest system (fall + spring), and a one-harvest system (fall or spring). Two-harvest feedstock ethanol content [EtOH] was the greatest (0.305 kg kg(-1) and 0.307k g kg(-1)) followed by the spring-harvested stover (0.201 kg kg(-1)). Biomass production and [EtOH] were then multiplied to calculate ethanol yields. Ethanol yield (L ha(-1)) decreased by 47% when stover-only feedstock was harvested in the spring compared to the fall. When only considering a single harvest system, incorporation of a cover crop did improve ethanol yield by 242 L ha(-1) at spring harvest. The two-harvest mixed feedstock system was the most productive with 41.8% greater ethanol yield when compared to the single harvest. Overall, the mixed biomass feedstocks resulting from the incorporation of a winter annual cereal with corn stover improved biomass yield and [EtOH] relative to stoveronly feedstocks."

Cereal-legume mixture may be a viable option to improve forage yield and increase on-farm protein production. A two-year experiment was conducted in 2009 and 2010 to determine if mixtures of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and annual medic (Medicago scutellata L.) could increase forage quality and forage dry matter. A randomized complete block design with two additive intercropping systems (100B:20M) (100% of barley pure stand seeding rate with 20% of annual medic pure stand seeding rate) and (100B:40M) with sole cultures of barley and annual medic. Total dry matter yield produced by intercrops averaged 3385 kg ha(-1) and was similar to that of barley sole crop (3590 kg ha(-1)). The land equivalent ratio was highest (1.07) when barley was intercropped with annual medic in the 100B:40M intercrop indicating that 7% more area would be required by a sole cropping system to produce a similar yield. Based on results from LER, relative crowding coefficient (RCC) and monetary advantage index (MAI), it was concluded that 100B:40M was superior to either barley or annual medic monocropping. The highest protein yield (893 kg ha(-1)) was obtained from the 100B:40M intercrop. When both forage yield and quality were considered, the 100B:40M intercropping system was superior and could be recommended as an alternative to barley alone. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

An Experimental Approach	INSECTS			English	Article						"BYDV-PAV; Rhopalosiphum padi; morph; arena experiment; companion plant; clover; barley"	"YELLOW-DWARF-VIRUS; MYZUS-PERSICAE HOMOPTERA; BREVICORYNE-BRASSICAE; NATURAL ENEMIES; VOLATILE CUES; HOST-PLANT; POPULATIONS; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; GROWTH"	Simple Summary Aphids are vectors of plant viruses and can cause important yield losses in numerous crops. Rhopalosiphum padi is the main vector of Barley yellow dwarf virus PAV (BYDV-PAV). The yellow dwarf disease (YDD), present in all cereal growing regions in the world, caused by BYDV-PAV, can induce up to 80% of yield losses in barley. In a context of global warming, reduction of pesticide uses, and development of organic farming, new control methods for YDD incidence are needed. In this study, the association of a winter barley with clover was tested for its impact(s) on the R. padi/BYDV-PAV pathosystem. The effect of clover was different according to the morph of the aphid introduced in a multi-plant (i.e., arena) experimental design in laboratory. A spatial effect on aphid distribution (observed for alate founder morph) and a reduction of the size of aphid populations (observed for wingless founder morph) are described. However, the presence of clover did not modify, under our experimental conditions, the efficiency of BYDV-PAV infections and within arena spread of YDD. Thus, clover used by cereal growers for other services (weeds reduction, nitrogen supply, and soil cover), would participate to lower the risks associated to the presence of BYDV vectors through a bottom-up regulation of aphid populations within the field. Barley/clover intercropping should be considered as a promising method for a future management strategy against vectors of yellow dwarf disease, especially in an insecticide-free agriculture. Intercropping, i.e., association of two or more species, is promising to reduce insect populations in fields. The cereal aphid Rhopalosiphum padi, a vector of the Barley yellow dwarf virus PAV (BYDV-PAV), represents a major threat for cereal grain production. In this study, we tested the potential of winter barley intercropped with clover to reduce the size of R. padi populations and to lower the BYDV-PAV incidence in fields. We used arenas (i.e., sets of 36 barley plants) intercropped with or without clover plants (at different sown densities). In each arena, a single viruliferous founder, R. padi, (with an alate or a wingless morph) was deposited to introduce aphids and viruses in the experiment. Thirteen days later, the number of aphids in the arena, the percentage of plants hosting aphids and the infection rates were monitored. Data produced through this experimental design showed that clover alters the distribution of the aphid progeny (lower aphid spread) produced by an alate founder morph. Moreover, clover reduces the size of aphid populations produced by a wingless founder morph. However, despite the effects of clover on biological parameters of R. padi, the presence of clover in barley arena did not modify BYDV infections, suggesting complex mechanisms between partners of the BYDV pathosystem for plant-to-plant virus spread.

However, it is not evident from the literature what size of weed suppressive effect is achieved on average by intercropping, and how species choice and crop management affect this effect. We conducted a global metaanalysis of published data to quantify the effect of intercropping on weed biomass in annual arable intercrops grown for their final product. We searched the literature to identify all papers reporting usable experimental data and extracted 339 data records from 39 publications containing data from 76 independent experiments. Two metrics of weed suppression were defined to assess the weed suppressive effect of intercropping: the ratio of observed weed biomass in an intercrop to weed biomass in the less weed suppressive sole crop (Rweak), and the ratio of weed biomass in the intercrop to weed biomass in the more weed suppressive sole crop (Rstrong). On average, weed biomass in the intercrop was substantially and significantly (58%) lower (Rweak = 0.42) than in the less suppressive sole crop. No significant difference was found between weed biomass in the intercrop and weed biomass in the more weed suppressive sole crop, even though weed biomass tended to be slightly larger in the intercrop than in the more weed suppressive sole crop (Rstrong = 1.08). Findings were consistent across different groups of species combinations, such as maize/legume and small-grain cereal/legume intercrops. Intercrops with an additive design had stronger weed suppression than intercrops with a replacement design. In the latter, a mixed arrangement gave stronger weed suppression than a row design, while spatial arrangement did not affect weed suppressive ability in additive designs. No significant effects on weed biomass were found of simultaneous vs. relay intercropping, and of nitrogen fertilizer input. The Rweak decreased significantly with the land equivalent ratio in additive intercrops but not in replacement intercrops, while Rstrong was unrelated to LER in both designs. The results confirm that intercropping is generally a useful approach for suppressing weeds in annual crop cultivation. Further work is needed to disentangle the contributions of species density, species traits and mixing ratio to weed suppression in intercropping.	"[Gu, Chunfeng; Bastiaans, Lammert; Anten, Niels P.

Effects of selected soil and water conservation techniques on runoff, sediment yield and maize productivity under sub-humid and semi-arid conditions in Kenya	CATENA			English	Article						"Tillage; Mbili intercropping; Mulching; Erosion"	"USE EFFICIENCY; MINIMUM TILLAGE; LOESS PLATEAU; CROP YIELD; RAINFALL; EROSION; MANAGEMENT; FARMERS; PERFORMANCE; MITIGATION"	The aim of this work is to investigate the consequences of selected soil and water conservation techniques and tillage practices on runoff amounts, sediment yield and maize yields under semi-arid and sub-humid environments. Field trials were set in Kigogo primary school in Meru South Sub-County, Tharaka Nithi County, representing the sub-humid conditions, and Machang'a secondary in Mbeere South Sub-County, Embu County (semi-arid) in the central highlands of Kenya. The experiment layout was a randomized complete block design and the treatments were implemented in runoff plots. Tied ridging (TR) was the most efficient technique in reducing runoff and sediment yield and at the same time boosting crop yields in the semi-arid region. It significantly (p < 0.05) reduced sediment yields by 94% compared to the conventional tillage (CT) during the study period. The effects were particularly strong in periods of below average rainfall (dry seasons). During the drier season of short rains 2010 (SR10), grain yield under TR was 7 times higher compared to CT (p < 0.01). In the sub-humid region, minimum tillage (MT) generated high runoff but relatively low sediment yield compared to CT. During periods of enough rainfall (over 450 mm per season) in the drier site, intercropping suppressed maize yields significantly (p < 0.01) by 42% compared to conventional tillage in the drier site. The results on the magnitude of runoff and sediment under the different soil and farm management practices are crucial in selection and promotion of valid farm management practices and tillage alternatives that not only abate soil erosion but also boost agricultural productivity in both sub-humid and semi-arid agro-ecological zones.

Intercropping contributes to increased P, Fe and Zn uptake and thereby increases yield and improves grain nutritional quality and ultimately human health. A better understanding of how intercropping leads to increased plant P, Fe and Zn availability will help to improve P-fertilizer-use efficiency and agronomic Fe and Zn biofortification. Scope This review synthesizes the literature on how intercropping of legumes with cereals increases acquisition of P, Fe and Zn from soil and recapitulates what is known about root-to-shoot nutrient translocation, plant-internal nutrient remobilization and allocation to grains. Conclusions Direct interspecific facilitation in intercropping involves below-ground processes in which cereals increase Fe and Zn bioavailability while companion legumes benefit. This has been demonstrated and verified using isotopic nutrient tracing and molecular analysis. The same methodological approaches and field studies should be used to explore direct interspecific P facilitation. Both niche complementarity and interspecific facilitation contribute to increased P acquisition in intercropping. Niche complementarity may also contribute to increased Fe and Zn acquisition, an aspect poorly understood. Interspecific mobilization and uptake facilitation of sparingly soluble P, Fe and Zn from soil, however, are not the only determinants of the concentrations of P, Fe and Zn in grains. Grain yield and nutrient translocation from roots to shoots further influence the concentrations of these nutrients in grains.

Fifty-six households in Rudhiapada and Badamahulidiha, Odisha, India were selected to evaluate farmers' efficiency using conservation agriculture (CA) cropping system practices. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) and regression analysis were used to estimate farmer efficiency and the determinants of yield. Conventional tillage with the local maize cultivar was compared to reduced tillage with improved maize cultivar and maize intercropped with cowpea. Badamahulidiha outperformed Rudhiapada in yields for all cropping systems. This could be attributed to lower input use and exposure to NGO training. The current efficiency level of farmers' productivity was between 0.4 and 0.7. Inputs such as labor, seed, and fertilizers were found to be significant in increasing yield except for female labor and phosphate. This finding suggests conservation agriculture cropping system is female friendly. The conservation agriculture cropping systems improved maize yields by 60% to 70% when compared to conventional farming system. Combining conservation agriculture practices with improving efficiency of farmers in optimal use of the inputs can contribute substantially to productivity, thus enhancing food security and nutrition in the face of climate change in India and other tropical areas.

The emphasis was on the cultivable bacterial community since the overall objective is to obtain inoculants to improve the remediation of this type of contaminated site. Root endophytic and rhizosphere soil bacterial counts were determined, and isolates were pooled by amplified rDNA restriction analysis and identified by 16S rDNA sequencing. Isolates were further characterized for the production of plant growth-promoting (PGP) substances, and resistance to TM. The selected strains were evaluated for their ability to degrade PAHs. The potential of cell-free microbial supernatant to increase the mobilisation of PAHs from the polluted soil of Pierrelaye was also evaluated. Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria dominated the collection of isolates, and differences in taxonomic diversity were observed between plant species (Populus or Zea mays) and depending on the remediation treatment (Populus inoculation with mycorrhizae or Populus intercropping with Alnus). The majority of isolates exhibited at least one of the tested PGP traits, as well as resistance to more than one TM. Several rhizosphere, endophyte and even one bulk soil isolate showed high rates of fluoranthene and pyrene reduction. The endophyte Rhizobium strain MR28 isolated from maize and degrading pyrene produced bioemulsifying molecules capable of improving the availability of PAHs from the soil of Pierrelaye.

The research was carried out in Chuka and Kandara sites in the Central Highlands of Kenya for four seasons; long rains 2016, short rains 2016, long rains 2017 and short rains 2017. The experimental design was a split plot with tillage method (minimum and conventional) as the main treatments and soil fertility inputs as the sub-treatments: Sole mineral fertiliser, mineral fertiliser combined with crop residue, mineral fertiliser combined with animal manure, Tithonia diversifolia combined with phosphate rock (Minjingu), animal manure intercropped with Dolichos Lablab L. and a Control (conventional tillage with no inputs). Except for the control, and sole mineral fertiliser, crop residue was applied as mulch in all treatments. Based on the results, the treatments with mineral fertiliser (sole mineral fertiliser combined with mineral fertiliser treatment and mineral fertiliser combined with animal manure treatment) consistently enhanced maize crop growth and development as observed through enhanced chlorophyll content, plant height and yields.

Studies are described that have led to the development of a 'push-pull' strategy for minimising stem borer damage to maize and sorghum. This involved the selection of plant species that could be employed as trap crops to attract colonisation away from the cereal plants, or as intercrops to repel the pests. The two most successful trap crop plants were Napier grass, Pennisetum purpureum, and Sudan grass, Sorghum sudanensis. The intercrop giving maximum repellent effect was molasses grass, Melinis minutiflora, but two legume species, silverleaf, Desmodium uncinatum, and greenleaf, D intortum, gave good results and had the added advantage of suppressing development of S hermonthica. In terms of stem borer control, the plant chemistry responsible involves release of attractant semiochemicals from the trap plants and repellent semiochemicals from the intercrops. With M minutiflora, parasitism of stem borers was also increased by certain chemicals repellent to ovipositing adults. The mechanism of striga control has not been fully elucidated, but allelopathic effects from the Desmodium species have been shown to involve stimulation of germination and interference with haustorial development. Significant beneficial effects have been obtained with the individual components of these push-pull strategies. However, the most robust crop-protection package is obtained when these components are combined. The trap crop and intercrop plants also provide valuable forage for cattle, often reared in association with subsistence cereal production. There has been considerable take-up of the system within the communities where farmer-managed trials have been carried out, particularly in the Trans Nzoia and Suba districts of Kenya, and the programme is set to expand throughout and beyond Kenya.

Assessing the Adaptation Implications in Zambia	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						"Climate change; climate smart agriculture; food security; maize yields; panel data"	"CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; FOOD SECURITY; PRODUCTIVITY; AFRICA; ADOPTION; SYSTEMS; YIELDS; MAIZE"	We examine a set of potentially climate smart agricultural practices, including reduced tillage, crop rotation and legume intercropping, combined with the use of improved seeds and inorganic fertiliser, for their effects on maize yields in Zambia. We use panel data from the Rural Incomes and Livelihoods Surveys merged with a novel set of climatic variables based on geo-referenced historical rainfall and temperature data to explore the changing effects of these practices with climatic conditions. We estimate the impacts on maize yields, and also on the exhibition of very low yields and yield shortfalls from average levels, as indicators of resilience, while controlling for household characteristics. We find that minimum soil disturbance and crop rotation have no significant impact on these yield outcomes, but that legume intercropping significantly increases yields and reduces the probability of low yields even under critical weather stress during the growing season. We also find that the average positive impacts of modern input use (seeds and fertilisers) are significantly conditioned by climatic variables. Timely access to fertiliser emerges as one of the most robust determinants of yields and their resilience. These results have policy implications for targeted interventions to improve the productivity and the resilience of smallholder agriculture in Zambia in the face of climate change.

It is not clear how plant N and P uptake and N:P stoichiometry vary between monoculture and intercropping throughout an entire growing season under different N fertilization and mulching practices. Here, we addressed how plant interspecific competition for nutrients have affected the temporal dynamics of crop N and P uptake (and N:P ratios) in five cropping systems (wheat, maize and barley monocultures, and wheat/maize and barley/maize intercropping), under two N levels (0 and 225 kg N ha(-1)) and two maize mulching treatments (with and without). Wheat and barley had greater N and P competitive ability than maize, leading to an increase in N and P uptake of wheat and barley and a decrease in N and P uptake of maize during co-growth stages in intercropping. N:P ratios of three crop species decreased with plant growth. Crop-level N:P ratios were either not affected by intercropping or did not change consistently with N fertilization while film mulching decreased maize N:P ratios. Community-level N:P ratios of the two intercrops were different from those of the corresponding monoculture at maturity. Because (i) the proportion of N and P removal from intercropping differs from monocultures, and (ii) N and P uptake by crops is decoupled under N fertilization and mulching, these findings may have practical implications for the nutrient budget of intercropping systems.

However, bean cultivar evaluations have identified significant cultivar x cropping system interactions. The objective of this study was to determine whether intercrop and sole cropping systems have different effects on phenotypic and genetic variance components of bean populations. Unselected F-2 and F-3 populations of 16 crosses of common bean were evaluated in the two cropping systems at Elora and Woodstock, Ontario, Canada, in 1993 and 1994. Significant population x cropping system interaction was found for grain yield and pods per plant. Genetic correlations between cropping systems were lowest for grain yield and pods per plant and highest for seed weight and seeds per pod. There were few differences between cropping systems for genetic variances. Genotype x location variance was higher in intercrop than in sole crop. Broad-sense heritabilities and narrow-sense heritabilities for most traits were comparable between cropping systems. The exception was pods per plant, which showed greater heritability in sole crop. Realized heritability of grain yield was greater in intercrop. We conclude that single plant selection as done with the pedigree system of breeding should be effective in intercrop.

Effect of intercropping forage peas (Pisum sativum L.) with winter wheat (Tritium vulgare L.) or triticale (Triticale hexaploide Lart.) on DM yield, nutritive characteristics when harvested at different stages of growth	ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE			English	Article							"NONIRRIGATED DAIRY FARMS; DRY-MATTER YIELD; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; SOUTHERN AUSTRALIA; CROP SYSTEMS; DIGESTIBILITY; PASTURE; CEREALS; SILAGE; RATIO"	An experiment was undertaken over 2 years (2007-09) to determine the effect of intercropping forage peas with either forage winter wheat or triticale for whole-crop silage. Monocultures of triticale (T100), wheat (W100) and forage peas (P100) and plus cereal-pea combinations of 75% triticale : 25% pea (T75), 50% triticale : 50% pea (T50), 25% triticale : 75% pea (T25), 75% wheat : 25% pea (W75), 50% wheat : 50% pea (W50), 25% wheat : 75% pea (W25), with ratios based on sowing rate, were evaluated for DM yield and nutritional characteristics at a range of growth stages. It was hypothesised that an increase in the ratio of peas to cereal would not adversely affect DM yield and would have a positive impact on nutritive characteristics across a range of harvest times based on growth stages of the cereal component of mixes. In Year 1, at the boot stage of growth of cereals, P100 had a lower DM yield than W100 and all triticale-based treatments, while in Year 2 P100 had a lower DM yield than all other treatments. By the soft dough growth stage in Year 1, all triticale treatments except T25 had higher DM yields than P100 and in Year 2 P100 had a lower DM yield than all triticale treatments and W100. The crude protein (CP) concentration of P100 at the boot stage of growth was higher than T100, T75, T50, W100 and W50 in Year 1 and all treatments in Year 2. At soft dough, P100 had a higher CP concentration than all other treatments in both years, while T25 and W25 had higher CP concentrations than their respective monocultures. In Year 1 at soft dough, W100 had a lower estimated ME concentration than other wheat treatments and P100, while in Year 2, T50 and W50 had higher values than T100 and W100, respectively. Bi-cropping forage peas with winter cereal forage crops did not adversely affect DM yields at a range of different harvest times, but did not consistently and significantly improve nutritive characteristics. Despite relatively high sowing rates of forage peas, their total contribution in mixes with cereals to DM yield was low, indicating that their ability to compete with winter cereals under the high fertility conditions of the experiment was low. When grown as a monoculture peas tended to produce lower DM yields but had higher CP concentrations and a higher harvested CP/ha at the soft dough stage of growth. The timing of harvesting will affect DM yields and nutritive characteristics and can be manipulated depending upon the end use of the feed grown and also to allow greater flexibility in the sowing of subsequent forages. Consideration should also be given to the growing of monocultures of winter cereals and forage peas and developing systems to mix during ensiling to capture both DM yield potential and optimum nutritive characteristics.

The main treatments consisted of the control or without fertilizer (N0), biofertilizer (Nbi) (Azotobacter, Rhizobium, Azospirillum, mycorrhiza), chemical nitrogen fertilizer (Nch 100) and integrative fertilizer including biofertilizer plus 50% chemical nitrogen fertilizer (Nbi + Nch50). The subtreatments included sole cultivation of fenugreek without weeds (T0), sole cultivation of fenugreek with weeds (Tw), sole cultivation of sorghum without weeds (S0), sole cultivation of sorghum with weeds (Sw), cultivation of sorghum + 50% fenugreek (ST50) and cultivation of sorghum + 100% fenugreek (ST100). Based on the results, the highest effective extract of fenugreek (trigonelline) and fenugreek dry matter was gained through the application of biological fertilizer + the sole fenugreek treatment (no weeds). Moreover, the highest sorghum dry mater was yielded by the use of the integrative fertilizer + the sole sorghum (no weeds) treatment; however, the highest total dry matter was observed to be more in the mixed treatment of integrative fertilizer and sorghum + 50% fenugreek. The lowest weed biomass was also linked to the integrative treatment biological fertilizer and sorghum + 100% fenugreek."

A two-year field experiment was conducted at Astaneh-ye Ashrafiyeh, Northern Iran, to evaluate the effect of Azotobacter (Azotobacter chroococcum) inoculation on the growth and yield of a peanut/maize intercropping system. The experimental design was a randomized complete block in a factorial arrangement with three replicates. Factors were Azotobacter application [control (non-inoculated) and inoculation (with Azotobacter chroococcum) and different maize (Zea mays L.)/peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) intercropping pattern (100% peanut + 100% maize, 100% peanut + 50% maize, 50% peanut + 100% maize, 50% peanut + 50% maize, 67% peanut + 33% maize, and 33% peanut + 67% maize). Sole cropping of peanut and maize were also used. Results showed that averaged across years and intercropping patterns, grain yields of peanut and maize were significantly increased by 10% and 16%, respectively, in inoculated plots compared to non-inoculated ones. Azotobacter also had a positive significant effect on nitrogen concentration of grain, while it had no significant effect on oil concentration of peanut grain and significantly decreased the oil concentration of maize grain. Land equivalent ratio (LER) ranged from 1.05 to 1.70, indicating more efficient and productive use of environmental resources by intercrops. Results also showed that inoculated intercropped plots had 12-16% grater LER that non-inoculated ones. The highest LER was observed for inoculated plot with 100% peanut + 50% maize intercropping pattern (1.70), while the lowest one was recorded for non-inoculated plot with 50% peanut + 50% maize intercropping pattern (1.05). Based on the result of this experiment, intercropping pattern of 100% peanut + 50% maize along with Azotobacter application is recommended to obtain the highest productivity in maize/peanut intercropping system.

Model Pareto multi-objective calibration and long-term scenario analysis using disaggregated rainfall	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article							"SOIL; WATER; INFILTRATION; OPTIMIZATION; PARAMETERS"	In order to evaluate the impact of intercrop management on runoff and erosion in a continuous maize cropping system, the plot scale, continuous and process-based erosion model (CREHDYS) developed previously must be calibrated accounting for its two main outputs: runoff and sediment loss. To do that, a global Pareto multi-objective calibration was applied to these two potentially conflicting objectives, considering daily runoff and periodical erosion rates, for two sites with different slopes and soil textures. This revealed a trade-off between both objectives. The large resulting Pareto uncertainty regarding parameters did not translate into a large predictive uncertainty of daily runoff but resulted into a large uncertainty on erosion prediction. Globally, model results were satisfactory with regard to daily runoff prediction (Nash-Sutcliffe index varying within the Pareto solution set from 0.65 to 0.91 for calibration and 0.64 to 0.77 for validation period) and relatively satisfactory for periodical erosion. However, the small number of available data points (three) for model validation in terms of periodical erosion prediction was not sufficient to ensure a proper validation. The calibrated model was in turn used to perform a scenario analysis of the long-term hydrological and erosive impact of inter-cropping period management in a continuous maize cropping system, using disaggregated rainfall. The long-term simulations mainly revealed that, with regard to the erosion prevention during the inter-cropping period, planting a winter cover crop is a better option than reduced tillage with a cultivator (0-12 cm), even if the cover is destroyed early (1 January). As compared with the situation of a bare heavily crusted soil with two semi-permanent wheel tracks, reduced tillage led to an erosion reduction from 90 to 97%, an early cover destruction (1 January) to an erosion decrease from 92 to 98% and a cover destroyed on 1 March or later to an average soil loss reduction from 96 to 99%.

It has been proposed that herbivore populations are lower in diverse than in simple plant habitats because of greater abundance and/or higher efficiency of natural enemies in mixed plant stands. However, higher enemy colonization is expected in mono-rather than multispecific vegetation if the response of specialist natural enemies to habitat diversification is similar to that of monophagous herbivores. 2. We used release-recapture experiments to determine how the presence of maize (non-host plant) influences the movement of the parasitoid Pediobius foveolatus in the absence of hosts. We then assessed how vegetation diversity affects wasp reproduction (parasitism) and subsequent density in the presence of its hosts, Mexican bean beetle larvae. 3. Fewer female wasps immigrated into and more emigrated out of a bean-tall maize intercrop than bean monocultures. Bean plant density and the presence of maize per se did not significantly affect parasitoid immigration. Instead, maize height was the primary factor contributing to lower female immigration into the bean-tall maize plots. However, tall maize plants did not impede the wasps' within-habitat movement. 4. When wasps were released outside the plots, higher parasitism was recorded in monocultures, irrespective of host density. In contrast, when wasps were released within the plots, significantly higher parasitism rates were found in the bean-tall maize habitat. 5. Results suggest that female wasps accumulate in the bean-tall maize habitat in response to resources other than hosts and, ultimately, wasp density may be determined primarily by differential emigration rather than by immigration rates.

J	"Clermont-Dauphin, C; Cabidoche, YM; Meynard, JM"				"Clermont-Dauphin, C; Cabidoche, YM; Meynard, JM"			Diagnosis on the sustainability of an upland cropping system of southern Haiti	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"sustainability; bean-maize intercrop; cropping system; tropical upland; potassium; magnesium"	"SOIL; AGROECOSYSTEMS; LEPIDOPTERA; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; CARBON; CORN"	An impact assessment of current upland cropping systems in Haiti was carried out using a combined experimental and agronomic survey approach on fields that were chosen as being representative of the diversity of land use practices and intensities. These cropping systems were mostly developed on ferralsols with differing degrees of weathering owing to the varying depths to the limestone bedrock. Three soil types for which the CEC of the mineral fraction was less than 3, 4-7, or 11-18 cmol((divided by)) kg(-1) were distinguished. The study shows that apart from phosphorus, soil cation availability (K, Mg) is the most limiting factor for a successful bean crop. With the insertion of a fertilized cabbage crop into the rotation, the soil bioavailable P at the sowing of the bean-maize intercrop (BMI) did not significantly increase, whereas the exchangeable K content of the soils increased from 0.22 to 0.38 and led to a significant increase in the bean yield from 654 to 1079 kg ha(-1). It is clear that the trend of the cropping systems towards a shorter fallow period, increasing frequency of the BMI and introduction of N-P-K fertilizers, may all increase crop production in the short term. However, these changes are unlikely to lead to sustained benefits. One of the potential risks is the soil Mg depletion due to K fertilization as revealed by a microlysimeter experiment. Another risk is the increased proportion of plants with bean root diseases, due to the shortening of the BMI rotation interval. The proportion of plants with bean root diseases increased from 7 to 22% in 1989 and from 10 to 39% in 1990. when the bean rotation interval was reduced front 3 to 1 years. Another risk is the spatial spread of fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) from the plots covered with residues of a preceding maize crop, to the neighboring plots recently sown with maize. Future research should therefore focus on optimizing the K:Mg ratio of fertilizer, breeding bean varieties resistant to Fusarium disease, diversifying the range of crops cultivated, and management of the maize residues. The evolution of the cropping systems in the last 10 years is somewhat consistent with the diagnosis made about 15 years earlier. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Jensen, ES				Jensen, ES			Grain yield, symbiotic N-2 fixation and interspecific competition for inorganic N in pea-barley intercrops	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						"Hordeum vulgare; intercropping; N-15-isotope dilution technique; N transfer; Pisum sativum; Relative Yield Total (RYT)"	"NITROGEN-FIXATION; MAIZE; SOIL; FERTILIZER; SYSTEMS; SORGHUM; GROWTH"	The effect of mixed intercropping of field pea (Pisum sativum L.) and spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), compared to monocrop cultivation, on the yield and crop-N dynamics was studied in a 4-yr field experiment using N-15-isotope dilution technique. Crops were grown with or without the supply of 5 g N-15-labeled N m(-2). The effect of intercropping on the dry matter and N yields, competition for inorganic N among the intercrop components, symbiotic fixation in pea and N transfer from pea to barley were determined. As an average of four years the grain yields were similar in monocropped pea, monocropped and fertilized barley and the intercrop without N fertilizer supply. Nitrogen fertilization did not influence the intercrop yield, but decreased the proportion of pea in the yield. Relative yield totals (RYT) showed that the environmental sources for plant growth were used from 12 to 31% more efficiently by the intercrop than by the monocrops, and N fertilization decreased RYT-values. Intercrop yields were less stable than monocrop barley yields, but more stable than the yield of monocropped pea. Barley competed strongly for soil and fertilizer N in the intercrop, and was up to 30 times more competitive than pea for inorganic N. Consequently, barley obtained a more than proportionate share of the inorganic N in the intercrop. At maturity the total recovery of fertilizer N was not significantly different between crops, averaging 65% of the supplied N. The fertilizer N recovered in pea constituted only 9% of total fertilizer-N recovery in the intercrop. The amount of symbiotic N-2 fixation in the intercrop was less than expected from its composition and the fixation in monocrop. This indicates that the competition from barley had a negative effect on the fixation, perhaps via shading. At maturity, the average amount of N-2 fixation was 17.7 g N m(-2) in the monocrop and 5.1 g N m(-2) in the intercropped pea. A higher proportion of total N in pea was derived from N-2 fixation in the intercrop than in the monocrop, on average 82% and 62%, respectively. The N-15 enrichment of intercropped barley tended to be slightly lower than of monocropped barley, although not significantly. Consequently, there was no evidence for pea N being transferred to barley. The intercropping advantage in the pea-barley intercrop is mainly due to the complimentary use of soil inorganic and atmospheric N sources by the intercrop components, resulting in reduced competition for inorganic N, rather than a facilitative effect, in which symbiotically fixed N-2 is made available to barley.

Combining corn with legumes for silage is a feasible strategy to improve crude protein (CP) concentration in corn silage. This study was conducted to determine silage nutritive quality and fermentation profiles of corn grown in mixture with soybean at different crop combination ratio. In this experiment, corn-soybean combinations of 75: 25, 50: 50 and 25: 75 in addition to monocrops of corn and soybean were evaluated. The crop combination ratio had significant effects on nutritive quality and fermentation characteristics of silage. Silage quality in terms of CP (75: 25 ratio 12.23%, 50: 50 ratio 12.88% and 25: 75 ratio 13.65%) was improved by intercropping compared with corn sole crop (9.91% CP). Increase ratio of soybean resulted in an increase in lactic acid and pH of the mixed silage. Sole soybean gave significantly higher lactic acid (3.57%) and pH of silage (4.33) compared to all other treatments but dry matter concentration was significantly higher in corn monocrop silage (34.34%) than other treatments. The propionic acid and butyric acid content of soybean monocrop and intercrops silage were in all cases higher than sole corn silage.	"[Baghdadi, A.; Halim, R. A.; Martini, M.

However, intercropping is always yield-advantageous, but consumes more water. Meanwhile, the intercropping advantage is usually attributed to the high inputs of resources, which lead to increased carbon emissions. It is unclear whether developing an improved agricultural production pattern could relieve this situation and enhance farming productivity in water limited arid areas. A field experiment using an improved system was conducted at an arid oasis region in northwestern China in 2014, 2015, and 2016. No-tillage coupled with two-year plastic film mulching and straw retention measures were integrated into intensified strip intercropping, and the effects on the crop yield, water use, and carbon emissions characteristics were determined. A sustainable evaluation index integrating several key parameters related to yield, water use, and carbon emission was created. We found that a wheat/maize intercropping pattern boosted the grain yield by 12.8 and 131.0% compared to the average yield of maize and wheat monoculture, respectively. The intercropping under no-tillage with straw covering and two-year plastic film mulching treatment (i.e., NTSI2) yielded 17009 kg ha(-1), an increase of 14.9%, in the three studied years compared to an intercropping pattern with conventional treatment (i.e., CTI). The wheat-maize intercrops produced 5.9 and 113.7% more energy yield than monoculture maize and wheat, respectively, and NTSI2 had a 6.6% greater energy yield than CTI. NTSI2 improved the water use efficiency based on the grain and energy yields by 15.5 and 7.1%, respectively, over the CTI treatment. The carbon emissions of wheat/maize intercropping pattern were 18.9% lower than maize monoculture, and NTSI2 treatment reduced carbon emissions over CTI by 14.7%. Compared with maize monoculture, the wheat/maize intercrops had a 27.2% lower water use efficiency based on carbon emissions, and the NTSI2 treatment was reduced by 14.4% compared to CTI. However, wheat/maize intercropping had a greater carbon emission efficiency of 39.9% than monoculture maize, and the NTSI2 treatment was increased by 34.7% in the three studied years than that of CTI. The wheat/maize intercropping pattern achieved the highest evaluation index among the three cropping patterns evaluated, and the NTSI2 treatment had the highest sustainable index among the four intercropping treatments assessed. Therefore, wheat/maize intercropping of no-tillage with two-year plastic film mulching and straw covering is the most sustainable and effective cropping production pattern in arid Oasis regions.

Moreover, using a legume as an intercrop can reduce costly N fertilizers inputs and can increase the N content of the straw mixture. Therefore, we studied cereal-legume intercrops as a source of food grain and straw bioethanol. We grew field pea and four cultivars of durum wheat, triticale, oat, and barley. Crops were grown during 2 years as a sole crop, in additive intercrop with 100 % of the sole crop density for the cereal and 50 % of sole crop density for the legume, and in replacement intercrop with 50 % of the sole crop density for each crop. Tall cereal cultivars were preferred over shorter cereals for an extra production of straw. Results show that growth resources were used up to 23-26 % more efficiently in intercrop than in sole crop for grain and straw production. Tall cereal cultivars suppressed legume yields in intercrops, thus reducing potential intercrop advantages. Pea in intercrop increased straw mixture N by 54 % the first year and by 91 % the second year, versus cereal alone.

This field trial aimed to investigate the response of seed blended crops of forage sorghum and legumes (soybean, cowpea and cluster bean) to varying seed proportions (100:35, 100:65 and 100:85), while their solitary crops were planted for comparison. Agronomic, physiological and agro-qualitative traits were taken as the experimental variables. Sorghum sown as a binary crop with legumes resulted in a significant (p<0.05) decrease of green biomass yield (15-38%) compared to the solo sorghum. In intercropping, soybean recorded 44% less yield, while green forage biomass of cowpea was decreased by 27%. However, the seed blended crop of sorghum-cowpea in 100:65 seed proportion recorded significantly (p<0.01) higher biomass (30%) than the mono culture of sorghum. The mixed seeded crop of sorghum and soybean in 100:85 seeding ratio was instrumental in improving the crude protein and lowering the crude fiber content of mixed forage. Sorghum-cowpea binary crop gave the maximum ether extractable fat and total ash of mixed forage, while the solo sorghum had the lowest nutritional quality. Thus, seed blending of sorghum and cowpea in 100:65 seed blending ratio may be suggested owing to higher productivity in irrigated Haplic Yermosols soil under semi-arid climatic conditions.

The results indicated that sole cropping of sorghum and maize recorded higher biomass yield than sole soy-bean and their intercrops. In contrast, the biomass yield of wheat during post rainy season was higher when the preceding crops were sole soybean or soybean + maize intercropping. At No level, intercropping of soybean + maize followed by wheat system was more productive and remunerative with a gain of 7.7 and 27.0 kg/ha of soil available P and K, respectively, but resulted in a net loss of 4.0 kg/ha of soil available N over a period of 2 years. This cropping system was less susceptible to runoff and soil erosion. At 75% and 100% recommended N levels, maize-wheat system was more productive and remunerative with a gain of 2.0 and 5.8 kg/ha of soil available N, 9.0 and 7.8 kg/ha of soil available P and 35.0 and 28.4 kg/ha of soil available K, respectively. However this cropping system resulted in higher runoff and soil loss. Adopting appropriate agronomic and soil conservation measures may correct the negative aspect of this system.

Simulating medium-term effects of cropping system diversification on soil fertility and crop productivity in southern Africa	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"APSIM; Commercial farming; Crop rotation; Residue management; Smallholder; Intercropping"	"SUSTAINABLE INTENSIFICATION; CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; ORGANIC-MATTER; MAIZE YIELD; WATER; NITROGEN; MODEL; GROWTH; COMPACTION; ROTATIONS"	Diversification of cropping is perceived as a strategy to simultaneously achieve high productivity and maintain environmental sustainability. In southern Africa, however, due to a lack of medium to long-term field trials, there is missing quantitative information. Utilising the capability of agro-ecosystem models to quantify the interactions of crop productivity with management and environmental variables, the APSIM model was evaluated against six and an eight-year field trial datasets comprised of different crop rotations and fertiliser rates under two contrasting agro-ecological conditions in South Africa (clay soil with a mean rainfall of 871 mm versus a sandy soil with a 570 mm rainfall). Model output was compared to observed grain yield, aboveground dry matter, soil organic carbon (SOC), and mineral nitrogen (N-min) dynamics. APSIM was able to reproduce the observed grain yield dynamics fairly well as indicated by a Wilmott index of agreement of 0.90. Prediction accuracy, as indicated by the absolute model error across all crops, however, only reached 39%. Simulated N-min and SOC dynamics showed similar patterns to the observations. Subsequently, the model was applied in a ten-year simulation experiment with rotation treatments (14 rotations, respectively intercropping systems, including a maize monoculture control), fertiliser levels (zero and 70 kg N ha(-1)), and residue management (retained and removed) for the two sites. For low input systems, such as smallholder farms, residue management and legume integration are of the utmost importance to maintain SOC and more pronounced N-min levels, which, for the sandy soil, resulted in an average maize yield increase of up to 1000 kg ha(-1). Maize monoculture treatments with residues removed reduced SOC moderately by 0.04-0.08 %, while yields declined strongly (> 1000 kg ha(-1)) over the simulated period of ten years. In commercial, fertilised cropping systems, allocating land to cultivate crops other than maize reduced the simulated total yield performance. This diversification disadvantage has to be considered against the benefits of increased SOC and yields in the medium-term, i.e. a period of ten years. For the commercial systems, maize intercropped with delayed sown oats or cowpea appeared promising.	"[Hoffmann, M.

J	"Hauggaard-Nielsen, H; Jensen, ES"				"Hauggaard-Nielsen, H; Jensen, ES"			Evaluating pea and barley cultivars for complementarity in intercropping at different levels of soil N availability	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"pea; Pisum sativum L.; barley; Hordeum vulgare L.; intercropping; cultivars; grain yield; N accumulation; land equivalent ratio"	"BIOLOGICAL NITROGEN-FIXATION; N-2 FIXATION; YIELD; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; LEGUMES; FORAGE; PLANT; OAT"	Two field experiments were carried out on a temperate sandy loam using six pea (Pisum sativum L.) and five spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivars to determine cultivar complementarity in the intercrop for grain yield, dry matter production and nitrogen (N) acquisition. Crops were grown with or without the supply of 40 or 50 kg N ha(-1) in the two experiments. Cultivars were grown as sole crops (SC) and as mixed intercrops (IC) using a replacement design (50:50). The land equivalent ratio (LER), which is defined as the relative land area under SC that is required to produce the yields achieved in intercropping, were used to compare cultivar performance in intercropping relative to sole cropping. Barley was the stronger competitor in the intercrops and as a result barley grain yield and nitrogen uptake in IC were similar to SC. The per plant pea grain production and aboveground N accumulation in IC were reduced to less than half compared to SC pea plants due to competitive interactions. Application of N caused a dynamic change in the intercrop composition. Competition from barley increased with N application and the pea contribution to the combined intercrop grain yield decreased. The LER values showed that in the intercrop plant growth resources were used on average 20% more efficient without N application and 5-10% more efficient with N application. The choice of pea cultivar in the intercrop influenced the intercrop performance to a larger degree than the choice of barley cultivar. Furthermore, pea cultivar x cropping systems interactions was observed, indicating that cultivars performed differently in sole and intercrops. An indeterminate pea cultivar competed strongly with barley causing a greater proportion of peas in the intercrop yield, but caused a reduced N uptake and yield of barley. Determinate peas with normal leaves caused the highest degree of complementary use of N sources by allowing barley to exploit the soil N sources efficiently, while they contribute with fixed N-2. However, difference in performance among cultivars was observed. Using the indeterminate pea cultivar combined IC grain yield was in general lower than the greatest sole crop yield and vice versa for the determinate pea cultivars. Up to 22% (LER = 1.22) greater combined IC grain yield was observed in several mixtures using determinate pea cultivars. From the present study, it is was concluded that there is a need for breeding suitable pea cultivars for intercropping purposes, since cultivars bred for sole cropping may not be the types, which are the most suitable for intercropping. For optimized N-use in pea-barley intercrops it is concluded that important traits for the intercropped pea are: (1) determinate growth, (2) a medium competitive root system for soil inorganic N and other nutrients during early growth, (3) high light absorption capacity by peas growing underneath the canopy of the higher barley component and (4) early establishment of symbiotic NZ fixation to support a high growth rate during early growth stages. Fertilized pea-barley intercrops gave a 15% higher net income than fertilized barley sole cropping and is regarded as a better safeguard for the farmer's earnings compared to pea sole cropping known for variable yields and poor competitive ability towards weeds.

Defense Response	LIFE SCIENCE JOURNAL-ACTA ZHENGZHOU UNIVERSITY OVERSEAS EDITION			English	Article								Intercropping is regarded as an effective and environment friendly cultivation practise in disease control. SCR infection severity and the differences of defense related enzymes activity under SCR inoculation were observed between sensitive and resistance genotypes and between mono-and inter-cropping cultivation manners of the same genotype. Compared to mono-cropping, the disease grade of SCR sensitive genotype inter-cropped with SCR resistance genotype decreased from 5 and 7 to 3 and 3 in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The defense related enzymes activities under SCR inoculation in SCR sensitive genotype were higher when inter-cropping with SCR resistance genotype than in mono-cropping. The result indicates that the disease resistance of plants is not only related to its hereditary but could also be affected by the genetic diversity of the cropping community. These results suggest that by intercropping the SCR susceptible genotype with the SCR resistant genotype can significantly enhance the defense related metabolism of the susceptible genotype under SCR inoculation and improve the resistance to SCR.

This experiment was started to determine the effect of four different shade treatments T-75 (75%); T-50 (50%); T-25 (25%); T-0 (0%, control) on morphology, physiology and yield of soybean plants. Relative to T-75 , treatments T-25 and T-0 significantly increased the stem diameter and stem breaking strength while plant height was decreased. The chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and chlorophyll a + b, photosynthetic and chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics were improved as shade decreased, and maximum values were observed in T-25 and T-0. Similarly, enzymatic activity of Rubisco was accelerated from T-75 to T-0. However, genes related to sucrose synthesis (SS and SPS) were down-regulated by increasing shade (T-75). Importantly, non-significant differences were measured for seed-yield between T-25 and T-0, and the plants of soybean under T-25 produced 88% of T-0 yield. Overall, these results implied that agronomist should develop an appropriate intercropping planting pattern where the maximum shade density ranges from 20 to 30 % to obtain higher seed yield of soybean crop under intercropping-system."

This study aimed to assess the pea variation for competitive ability and its associated traits and the efficiency of four phenotypic or genomic selection strategies. A set of 138 semi-leafless, semi-dwarf pea lines belonging to six recombinant inbred line populations and six parent lines were genotyped using genotyping-by-sequencing and grown in PS and in MS simultaneously with one barley and one bread wheat cultivar in two autumn-sown trials in Northern Italy. Cereal companions were selected in a preliminary study that highlighted the paucity of cultivars with sufficient earliness for association. Pea was severely outcompeted in both years albeit with variation for pea proportion ranging from nearly complete suppression (<3%) to values approaching a balanced mixture. Greater pea proportion in MS was associated with greater total yield of the mixture (r >= 0.46). The genetic correlation for pea yield across MS and PS conditions slightly exceeded 0.40 in both years. Later onset of flowering and taller plant height at flowering onset displayed a definite correlation with pea yield in MS (r >= 0.46) but not in PS, whereas tolerance to ascochyta blight exhibited the opposite pattern. Comparisons of phenotypic selection strategies within or across populations based on predicted or actual yield gains for independent years indicated an efficiency of 52-64% for indirect selection based on pea yield in PS relative to pea yield selection in MS. The efficiency of an indirect selection index including onset of flowering, plant height, and grain yield in PS was comparable to that of pea yield selection in MS. A genome-wide association study based on 5,909 SNP markers revealed the substantial diversity of genomic areas associated with pea yield in MS and PS. Genomic selection for pea yield in MS displayed an efficiency close to that of phenotypic selection for pea yield in MS, and nearly two-fold greater efficiency when also taking into account its shorter selection cycle and smaller evaluation cost.</p>	"[Annicchiarico, Paolo; Nazzicari, Nelson; Notario, Tommaso; Martin, Cristina Monterrubio; Romani, Massimo; Ferrari, Barbara; Pecetti, Luciano] Council Agr Res & Econ CREA, Res Ctr Anim Prod & Aquaculture, Lodi, Italy"		Annicchiarico, P (corresponding author), Council Agr Res & Econ CREA, Res Ctr Anim Prod & Aquaculture, Lodi, Italy.	paolo.annicchiarico@crea.gov.it	nazzicari, nelson/ABE-1344-2021	nazzicari, nelson/0000-0003-2710-9885	European Union [1912]	European Union(European Commission)	This work was carried out within the Horizon 2020 project Redesigning European cropping systems based on species mixtures-REMIX funded by the European Union (Grant Agreement no. 727217).

Land use change resulting from agricultural intensification can result in changes in termite species diversity and abundance. Termite species occurring in natural vegetation, maize monocrop and maize-beans intercrop macrohabitats were investigated in Embu and Machakos Counties, Kenya. Influence of soil properties and seasons was also evaluated. Across the two Counties, seven termite species were recorded with Machakos County having the highest number. Additive diversity partitioning of species richness and Simpson diversity showed that, alpha component contributed to 98.3% and 99.1% of the total diversity, respectively. Population densities of three termite species significantly varied between land use types in Machakos County but there were no differences in termite species abundance in Embu County. In addition, there were no significant differences in species richness between macrohabitats within each County. In Embu, season significantly influenced the abundance of Macrotermes subhyalinus, M. herus, and Coptotermes formosanus which occurred in greater numbers during the wet season. There was a significant influence of land use on Trinervitermes gratiosus and C. formosanus in Machakos with both species occurring in higher numbers in natural vegetation. Trinervitermes gratiosus was negatively associated with Mn and positively correlated to pH and sand. Macrotermes subhyalinus and M. herus showed a positive association with P and silt while C. formosanus was positively correlated to Ca and Mg. These findings provide an insight into the effects of land use change from natural vegetation to maize agro-ecosystems on termite diversity. It also provides a baseline for further studies on termite diversity in Kenya and their ecological significance.

The host plants were maize (Zea mays) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), while the nonhost plant was molasses grass (Melinis minutiflora). In single-choice tests, females of C. sesamiae chose volatiles from infested and uninfested host plants and molasses grass over volatiles from the control (soil). In dual-choice tests, the wasp preferred volatiles from infested host plants to those from uninfested host plants. There was no discrimination between molasses grass volatiles and those of uninfested maize, uninfested sorghum, or infested maize. The wasp preferred sorghum volatiles over maize. Combining uninfested maize or sorghum with molasses grass did not make volatiles from the combination more attractive as compared to only uninfested host plants. Infested maize alone was as attractive as when combined with molasses grass. Infested sorghum was preferred over its combination with molasses grass. Local growth conditions of the molasses grasses influenced attractiveness to the parasitoids. Volatiles from Thika molasses grass were attractive, while those from Mbita molasses grass were not. Growing the Thika molasses grass in Mbita rendered it unattractive and vice versa with the Mbita molasses grass. This is a case of the same genotype expressing different phenotypes due to environmental factors.

As maize is one of the main hosts of F. graminearum, the risk of infection by this plant pathogen is highest when wheat is grown after maize and infected crop residues are not buried through ploughing. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the agronomic and economic viability of two innovative cropping systems with the goal to reduce the risk of FHB and mycotoxins in subsequent wheat. These systems were maize-intercropping and cover cropping with different plant species before the wheat growing season under reduced tillage practices. METHODS: For the maize-intercropping study, red clover, sudangrass, phacelia, white mustard and Indian mustard were used as intercrops with grain maize and compared with a sole maize crop in a grain maize-winter wheat rotation under no-tillage or reduced tillage. For the cover cropping study, white mustard, Indian mustard and winter pea were used as interval cover crops in a silage maize-spring wheat rotation under no-tillage and compared with treatments without a cover crop, i.e. herbicide or plough applied after silage maize. The incidence of Fusarium head blight causing species and the accumulation of mycotoxins in grains of wheat as well as the crop yield were monitored. In addition, an economic assessment was conducted by calculating the receipts, operating costs and gross margin for each cropping system. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Growing intercrops with maize or interval cover crops in a maize-wheat rotation under reduced tillage decreased mycotoxins in wheat while maintaining wheat yield. The use of white mustard or Indian mustard as intercrops reduced deoxynivalenol in winter wheat by up to 52% compared with maize grown as a sole crop. The use of white mustard, Indian mustard or winter pea as interval cover crops also reduced deoxynivalenol and improved yield in spring wheat by up to 85% and 25%, respectively. Remarkably, the toxin reduction through these cover crops was comparable with that obtained by ploughing. However, due to increased operating costs, we observed economic trade-offs in these innovative cropping systems, i.e. 7-25% reduced gross margin over the entire rotation. SIGNIFICANCE: Both cereal growers and consumers can benefit from the recommended practices, which considerably lower the risk of mycotoxin contamination in harvest products while maintaining crop yield. To address the economic trade-offs, policy makers should support innovation in cropping systems, enhancing food safety while also ensuring the economic viability of cereal production systems.

The predominant crops grown are maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr]. They are typically grown as monocrops in a simple yearly rotation or with multiple years of maize (2 to 3) followed by a single year of soybean. This system is highly productive because the crops and management systems have been well adapted to the regional growing conditions through substantial public and private investment. Furthermore, markets and supporting infrastructure are highly developed for both crops. As maize and soybean production have intensified, a number of concerns have arisen due to the unintended environmental impacts on the ecosystem. Many areas across the Midwest are experiencing negative impacts on water quality, soil degradation, and increased flood risk due to changes in regional hydrology. The water quality impacts extend even further downstream. We propose the development of an innovative system for growing maize and soybean with perennial groundcover to recover ecosystem services historically provided naturally by predominantly perennial native plant communities. Reincorporating perennial plants into annual cropping systems has the potential of restoring ecosystem services without negatively impacting grain crop production and offers the prospect of increasing grain crop productivity through improving the biological functioning of the system.

"Maize/soybean relay intercropping system (MSR) is a popular cultivation method to obtain high yields of both crops with reduced inputs. However, in MSR, the effects of different strip widths on competitive strengths and grain yields of intercrop species are still unclear. Therefore, in a two-year field experiment, soybean was relay-intercropped with maize in three different strip-width arrangements (narrow-strips, 180 cm; medium-strips, 200 cm; and wide-strips, 220 cm), and all intercropping results were compared with sole maize (SM) and sole soybean (SS). Results showed that the optimum strip-width for obtaining high grain yields of maize and soybean was 200 cm (medium-strips), which improved the competitive-ability of soybean by maintaining the competitive-ability of maize in MSR. On average, maize and soybean produced 98% and 77% of SM and SS yield, respectively, in medium-strips. The improved grain yields of intercrop species in medium-strips increased the total grain yield of MSR by 15% and land equivalent ratio by 22%, which enhanced the net-income of medium-strips (by 99%, from 620 US $ ha(-1) in wide-strips to 1233 US $ ha(-1) in medium-strips). Overall, these findings imply that following the optimum strip-width in MSR, i. e., strip-width of 200 cm, grain yields, and competitive interactions of intercrop species can be improved."

The field experiment was conducted in Tangar da Serra/ MT. The experimental design was a randomized block in factorial scheme 3x2 + 1, were as three arrangements of intercropping, two species of forage and an additional treatment with maize monoculture in four replication. In maize monoculture and intercropping were evaluated: plant height and ear insertion height, plant population, weight of 100 grains, productivity, number of grain rows and number of grain per row. In forages intercropping with maize were evaluated plant population and dry matter accumulation. The arrangements with Maize + Forage sown in the line and Maize + Forage sown in two rows between rows with the species Urochloa hybrid promoted best corn yields. The modality and species affect both the productivity of maize as forages species. Grain yield of maize is higher in monoculture. The higher dry matter accumulation of Urochloa hybrid occurs in the Maize + Forage sown in one row between rows, while, for the Urochloa brizantha the arrangements studied do not affect their yields. The arrangement with best land use efficiency is Maize + Forage sown in two rows between rows for both study forage species.

However, the root morphological and physiological plasticity and, subsequently, the P uptake capability response to light conditions in intercropping systems remain unclear. Soybean was grown under two levels of P application rates in sole and intercropping systems (maize/soybean relay strip intercropping) from 2016 to 2018 in Renshou, southwest of China. As a supplement to the field experiment, soybean was also grown in L-S (simulating the light conditions of sole cropping in the field: light first and then shading) and S-L (simulating the light conditions of intercropping in the field: shading first and then light) light conditions with two levels of P application in 2018 in a pot experiment. After maize harvest (approximately 3/4 of the soybean growth period), light capture in intercropping was higher than sole (ameliorated light conditions in intercropping system), which resulted in an advantage of P uptake in intercropped soybean. Both low P supply and more light capture increased the total root length and root APase activity.The genes GmEXPB2 (which is associated with root growth) and GmACP1 (which is associated with exudation of APase) were highly expressed in plants that captured more light under both P-sufficient and P-deficient conditions. Additionally, more light capture increased the production of lateral roots and the proportion of in the upper 15 cm soil layer roots at the reproductive stage in the field. Across the field and pot experiments, increased root morphological and physiological plasticity were associated with lower P concentrations in the leaves and greater allocation of photosynthates to roots as sucrose. It is suggested that ameliorated light conditions can regulate soybean root growth plasticity and, consequently, P uptake in maize/soybean relay strip intercropping systems, especially in the areas with low solar radiation.

Effect of supplementation with lablab hay and incremental levels of wheat bran on voluntary food intake, digestibility, milk yield and milk composition of crossbred cows fed maize-lablab stover or oats-vetch hay ad libitum	LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION SCIENCE			English	Article						"cereals; forage legumes; lablab hay; wheat bran; intake; digestibility; milk production"		"This study examined the effects of lablab hay and graded level's of wheat bran supplementation on feed intake, feed degradation characteristics, apparent digestibility, milk yield and milk composition of crossbred cows fed forages from cereal crops + legume intercropping (maize/lablab (ML) stover or oats/vetch (OV) hay). Forty eight multiparous crossbred cows arranged in a randomised complete design with eight dietary treatments and six animals per treatment were used in the study. The dietary treatments comprised of either ad libitum ML stover + 0.5% BW lablab hay or ad libitum OV hay + 0.9% BW lablab hay, each supplemented with 0, 1.25, 2.50, and 3.75 kg DM of wheat bran. The combination of wheat bran and lablab hay as supplements to cows fed ML stover and OV hay basal diets significantly improved DM digestibility (P < 0.01), which increased (P < 0.001) total DM intake by 21%. DM and OM degradation and the rates of degradation of DM, OM, N and NDF in the rumen were slightly improved by supplementing ML stover or OV hay basal diets with a combination of lablab hay and wheat bran. Supplementation with lablab hay and wheat bran combination increased milk yield by 21% (P < 0.05). Milk yield response to supplementation with lablab hay and wheat bran for the cows consuming ML stover diets was a linear increase (P < 0.001, R-2 = 0.996) with a mean increment of 1.09 kg milk per kg increase of wheat bran DM intake. Milk yield increased by 0.95, 1.3 and 0.95 kg/day for the first, second and third levels of wheat bran supplementation of cows fed ML stover. For OV hay treatments, the relationship between milk yield and increasing levels of wheat bran supplementation was quadratic (P < 0.001; R-2 = 0.990) and the mean response was highest (0.72 kg milk per kg wheat bran intake) at 2.50 kg DM level of wheat bran supplement. Increasing levels of wheat bran supplementation increased milk fat (P < 0.01) and total solids (P < 0.05) for crossbred cows fed ML stover treatments but the increases were not significant for OV hay-based diets. Milk protein concentration was not affected by wheat bran supplementation for both forages. It was concluded from this study that for optimum milk production, cows fed ML stover basal forage should be supplemented with 2.5 kg DM/head/day of wheat bran in addition to 0.5% BW lablab hay while for cows consuming OV hay forage should be supplemented with a combination of 2.5 kg DM/head/day of wheat bran and 0.9% BW lablab hay. The optimum levels of supplementation in this trial were associated with a mean milk yield of 10.94 kg/cow/day for the cows. on ML stover basal diet, and 10.84 kg/cow/day milk yield for those on OV hay basal diet. The improved milk yields obtained in the present trial as compared with the results of our previous trial where lablab hay alone was used as a supplement, were attributed to the additive effects of both lablab hay and wheat bran supplements which resulted in improved intake of DM, CP and metabolisable energy.

A meta-analysis covering 16 countries quantifies such effects and reveals the conditions under which they are maximized. Conservation agriculture (CA) has become a dominant paradigm in scientific and policy thinking about the sustainable intensification of food production in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet claims that CA leads to increasing crop yields in African smallholder farming systems remain controversial. Through a meta-analysis of 933 observations from 16 different countries in sub-Saharan African studies, we show that average yields under CA are only slightly higher than those of conventional tillage systems (3.7% for six major crop species and 4.0% for maize). Larger yield responses for maize result from mulching and crop rotations/intercropping. When CA principles are implemented concomitantly, maize yield increases by 8.4%. The largest yield benefits from CA occur in combination with low rainfall and herbicides. We conclude that although CA may bring soil conservation benefits, it is not a technology for African smallholder farmers to overcome low crop productivity and food insecurity in the short term.

J	Eskandari, H				Eskandari, Hamdollah			Intercropping of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and bean (Vicia faba): Effects of complementarity and competition of intercrop components in resource consumption on dry matter production and weed growth	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						"Cereals; competitive ratio; intercropping; legume; resource consumption"	"MAIZE ZEA-MAYS; BARLEY INTERCROPS; PLANTING PATTERN; FORAGE QUALITY; VIGNA-SINENSIS; PEA-BARLEY; NITROGEN; SYSTEMS; YIELD; VETCH"	Wheat (Triticum aestivum) and bean (Vicia faba L.) sole crops and their mixture in three planting pattern (M-1: alternate-row intercrop, M-2: within-row intercrop, M-3: mixed intercrop) were used to investigate the amount of resource consumption in terms of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) interception, water and nutrient uptake. The experiment was carried out as randomized complete block design with four replications. The results show that intercropping systems had a significant effect on environmental resources consumption, where intercropping systems had more light interception and water, and nutrient uptake compared to sole crops, suggesting the complementarity effect of intercropping components in resources consumption. The ability of wheat and bean was different in intercropping systems in absorbing nutrients because of their differences in root morphology and cation exchange capacity. Regarding weed suppressions, intercrops were more effective than wheat sole crops, which were related to lower availability of environmental resources for weeds in intercropping systems.

On the basis of two years pooled data results revealed that green leaf manure with maize residue mulch treatment recorded higher plant height (110.3cm), more number of tillers per plant (8.4), higher ear length (12.4cm) and grain weight (33.5g) in pearl millet. Similar treatment recorded higher pigeonpea plant height (140.44cm), primary branches (8.83), higher number of pods (90.3) and pod weight per plant (79.62g). The magnitude of improvement in grain yield of pearl millet and pigeonpea was 30.18 and 99.9% respectively, by green leaf manure with maize residue mulch compared to control. Similarly PMEY, net return and benefit cost ratio were also higher in green leaf manure with maize residue mulch over control.	"[Rajput, R. L.; Bhadouriya, N.

The productivity of species-diverse plant assemblages strongly depends on the temporal dynamics of nutrient uptake by competing neighbouring plants. Our understanding, however, of how rates of nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) uptake might change through time between neighbouring plant species under field conditions is still very limited. 2. Here, we specifically measure the temporal trajectories of N, P and K uptake by staple food plants such as wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) when growing either in monocultures or in intercropping systems. We ask how (i) plant species combinations, (ii) N fertilization and (iii) film mulching might affect key indexes of N, P and K uptake over time. We fit logistic models to characterize the nutrient uptake trajectories. 3. Maximum cumulative N, P and K uptake (kg ha(-1)) by wheat and barley were significantly greater in wheat-maize or barley-maize intercropping systems than in wheat or barley monocultures. Cumulative nutrient uptake by intercropped maize (either with wheat or with barley) was reduced by interspecific competition at early growth stages, but it increased rapidly after wheat and barley were harvested. Maximum cumulative N and P (but not K) uptake by intercropped maize were significantly higher than the uptake by monoculture maize, particularly when N fertilizer or film mulching was applied. 4. Intercropping induced a significant temporal niche differentiation in maximum daily nutrient uptake rates (kg ha(-1) day(-1)) between intercropped species. Fertilization had much stronger effects on maximum cumulative nutrient uptake of maize than that of wheat and barley. Mulching significantly increased the maximum cumulative nutrient uptake of maize and advanced the time to reach its maximum daily P and K uptake rates. 5. Our study provides evidence of an important temporal niche differentiation mechanism ('temporal complementarity') in nutrient uptake rates between neighbouring plant species. A better understanding of temporal trajectories of interspecific nutrient uptake rates remains crucial if we want to maximize the nutrient-use efficiency and sustain overyielding (i. e. high food production) in plant species-diverse systems such as intercropping.

Four experiments were conducted to examine the influence of: intercropped leafy daikon's seeding density on insect pest occurrence, trimming of intercropped leafy daikon on both insect pest occurrence and cabbage yield, and mix-cropping of leafy daikon and cabbage on insect pest occurrence. Leafy daikon intercropping reduced the occurrence of some insect pest species, especially that of the pests categorized as leaf-chewing pests, such as beet semi-loopers, Autographa nigrisigna Walker (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and small white butterflies, Pieris rapae crucivora Boisduval (Lepidoptera: Pieridae), and the results were compared with their occurrences in barley intercropping and non-intercropping. These two insect species were rarely observed on intercropped and mix-cropped leafy daikon, indicating it did not work as a trap crop. However, a reduction in cabbage yield due to shading of leafy daikon intercropping was observed, but the yield loss was mitigated by trimming of intercropped leafy daikon during the cultivation. Furthermore, leafy daikon intercropping with trimming had the same occurrence reduction effects against A. nigrisigna and P. rapae crucivora as leafy daikon intercropping without trimming. Our findings suggested that intercropping of closely related plants was possible by selecting the appropriate combinations of parameters and proper strategies, which proved to be useful for insect pest management in mix-cropping systems.

The legume hays were fed to lactating Bunaji cows (Experiment 1) and N'dama calves (experiment 2) for a period of 30 and 60 days, respectively using a completely randomized design with 4 animals per treatment in both trials. The dry Matter degradation characteristics of the forage legumes were also assessed tit three rumen - fistulated Bunaji castrates. Cows supplemented with C. pubescens and C. cajan produced higher milk (P<0.05) than those offered S. guianensis. Calves supplemented with C. pubescens and S. guianensis gained more weight (P<0.05) than those fed on C. cajan - supplement. Degradable fraction (b) were 338, 334 and 470g/kg for S. guianensis, C. pubesces and C. cajan, respectively. Additional benefits in terms of higher Milk and body weight increase could be derived from the use of cereal-based inter-cropped forage legumes as supplements especially by poor resource African smallholder Mixed farmers in the dry season.

The shoots were always in contact, while the roots of adjacent rows were free to interact or were completely separated. This allowed simultaneous testing the intraspecific and interspecific competition between rows, which to our knowledge has not been studied before. Root biomass, distribution in soil, morphometry, and functional traits were determined, together with the nodule number and biomass. The Land Equivalent Ratio for shoot biomass and N and P yield were higher than 1 when roots were in contact, and markedly lower when they were separated. This demonstrates the positive contribution of root interactions, which in field bean, consisted of increased root elongation without changes in biomass and nutrient status; in triticale, of increased N and P uptake efficiency and reduced biomass partitioning to roots. The soil-plant processes underlying intercrop advantage led to complementarity in N sources with low N inputs and facilitated N and P uptake with high N inputs, which demonstrates that intercropping could be profitable in both low and high input agriculture."

Men.]	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]; Intercropping; Lodging resistance; Cellulose"	"SUCROSE-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE; CALLOSE"	Stem lodging is the most important constraint for soybean at seedling stage in maize soybean inter cropping in China. This study was conducted to determine whether cellulose accumulation and lodging resistance of soybean was affected by different cropping systems and soybean varieties with different shading tolerance at seedling stage. Three soybean varieties Nandou 032-4 (shade susceptible), Jiuyuehuang (moderately shade tolerant) and Nandou 12 (shade tolerant) were used to investigate the effect of intercropping on soybean lodging behavior and cellulose accumulation in stems and its relationship to lodging resistance. Shading by maize significantly reduced cellulose accumulation and the stem breaking strength of the soybean, which were significantly negatively correlated with the lodging rate. In the maize soybean intercropping system, shading inhibited sucrose transportation and degradation into cellulose in the soybean stem. Less content of cellulose in soybean stem at the seedling stage resulted in lodging in the intercropping system. Compared with shade susceptible varieties, Nandou 12 had higher cellulose accumulation and related enzyme activities in the stem, and thus the stem breaking strength and lodging resistance of the basal stem increased. The higher activities of sucrose phosphate synthase and sucrose synthetase in the stem were associated with shade tolerance and lodging resistance. Thus, we concluded that the high physical strength and high cellulose contents of the stem of shade tolerant soybean reduced the rate of lodging in the maize soybean intercropping system.

Impact of no tillage and mulching practices on cotton production in North Cameroon: A multi-locational on-farm assessment	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH			English	Article						"Sorghum; Maize; Cover crops; Conservation agriculture; Africa"	"CONSERVATION TILLAGE; CROPPING SYSTEMS; SOIL-EROSION; COVER CROPS; AGRICULTURE; AFRICA; YIELD; CONSTRAINTS; MANAGEMENT; REVOLUTION"	The applicability of conservation agriculture (CA) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is poorly documented. In the Nord and Extreme-Nord provinces of Cameroon, in a 2-year rotation between a cereal (maize or sorghum) and cotton, conventional techniques were compared with CA. The study was conducted from 2001 to 2006 in 662 plots in 243 farmers' fields. Cereal treatments compared were conventional management techniques and CA consisting in the production of mulch using cover crops (Brachiaria ruziziensis, Crotalaria retusa, Dolichos lablab, Mucuna pruriens, Vigna unguiculata) intercropped within the cereal. In the Extreme-Nord province up to 9.7 t ha(-1) of vegetative biomass was produced in the CA plots with sorghum and cover crops against up to 4.8 t ha(-1) for sorghum alone in conventional plots. In the Nord province maize + cover crops produced up to 5.2 t ha(-1) of biomass against up to 2.5 t ha(-1) for maize alone. In both provinces, the cereal grain yields were equivalent or higher in CA compared to conventional plots. In 18 fields of the Extreme-Nord province the mulch remaining the year after sorghum + B. ruziziensis is mainly comprised between 3 t ha(-1) and 5 t ha(-1). Cotton treatments compared were T (tillage), NT (no tillage), and NTM (no tillage with mulch). In both provinces these treatments differed in soil cover, number of localized herbicide sprays used, ridging, and amount of nitrogen fertilizer used. In the Extreme-Nord province treatments differed also for the number of weeding and the date of the first weeding. In the Extreme-Nord province cotton yields were 12% lower for T and 24% lower for NT than for NTM. Cotton yields were regressed on crop husbandry indicators and used inputs. After a manual backward removal in a multiple linear regression respectively no parameters were found to significantly influence yield for T, only one parameter for NT, the number of herbicide sprays used at sowing, and three parameters for NTM: difference between heavy clay and silty loam, application of NPK fertilizer, sowing date. In the Nord province no difference in cotton yield was observed between T, NT and NTM. The flowering period was longer for NTM vs NT in the Extreme-Nord and the Nord provinces and NTM vs Tin the Nord province, respectively 13, 9 and 8 days. Although we show that CA techniques can have benefits at field level, further studies are needed to assess their suitability at farm and village levels. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By stimulating indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), cover cropping enhances soil health and promotes agroecosystem sustainability. Still, the legacy effects of cover crops (CCs) and the major factors driving the AM fungal community are not well known; neither is the influence of the specific CC. This work describes a field experiment established in Central Spain to test the effect of replacing winter fallow by barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) or vetch (Vicia sativa L.) during the intercropping of maize (Zea mays L.). We examined the community composition of the AMF in the roots and rhizosphere soil associated with the subsequent cash crop after 10 years of cover cropping, using Illumina technology. The multivariate analysis showed that the AMF communities under the barley treatment differed significantly from those under fallow, whereas no legacy effect of the vetch CC was detected. Soil organic carbon, electrical conductivity, pH, Ca and microbial biomass carbon were identified as major factors shaping soil AMF communities. Specific AMF taxa were found to play a role in plant uptake of P, Fe, Zn, Mn, and Cd, which may shed light on the functionality of these taxa. In our conditions, the use of barley as a winter CC appears to be an appropriate choice with respect to promotion of AMF populations and biological activity in agricultural soils with intercropping systems. However, more research on CC species and their legacy effect on themicrobial community composition and functionality are needed to guide decisions in knowledge-based agriculture.

Such knowledge is especially important for small-scale farmers in West Africa who spend a greater percentage of family labour in controlling weeds. This study assessed the composition, pattern and magnitude of seedling emergence of weed communities of a maize/cassava association in three types of fallow and four landuse intensities (continuous cropping or zero-fallow, 1 year of cropping followed by 1, 2, and 3 years fallow) over a 6-year period in Ibadan, Nigeria, West Africa. The study was carried out on a sandy loam (oxic paleustaff and psammentic ustorthent), <2% organic matter, and pH 6.2. Rainfall pattern at the study site is bimodal with average annual precipitation of 1250 mm. Weed seedling composition in the bush fallow treatment differed with year (e.g. seedling composition increased from 30 species in 1990 to 41 species in 1995) and was different from Leucaena leucocephala and Pueraria phaseoloides fallow treatments where volunteer seedlings of the respective fallow types were also present. At the initiation of the study, 1990, the seedling community was dominated by perennial weeds (60%). After 6 years, 84% of the weed seedlings were broadleaf (53% annuals and 31% perennials). Weed seedling emergence differed with type of fallow, landuse intensity and year (P<0.01). Weed seedlings emerged throughout the sampling period of 3-15 weeks after planting (WAP) crops. The highest number of weed seedlings emerged early in the season (3-5 WAP) followed by a second but smaller peak flush at 8-9 WAP and a decline over the rest of the sampling period in all types of fallow, landuse intensity, and years except in 1994. Natural bush and L leucocephala fallow had more weed seedlings than R phaseoloides fallow in all years except 1993 and 1995. Continuously cropped plots and plots cropped every other year had more emerged weed seedlings than plots that were cropped once followed by 2-3 years of uncropped fallow. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Recovery of N-15 labeled urea by the alley cropping system	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						"anion exchange capacity; cowpea; maize; N balance; particulate organic matter"	"LEUCAENA; DYNAMICS; ULTISOL"	Improved cropping systems with in-situ production of organic matter require the input of additional inorganic N to maintain crop production in a sustainable way. For proper management of this fertilizer-N, it is necessary to quantify how the applied fertilizer N is used by the various components of the system and by the system as a whole. The fate of a single application of N-15 labeled urea-N through the different components (crop, hedgerow, surface litter, soil profile up to 150 cm) of a Senna siamea alley cropping system, intercropped with maize in the first and cowpea in the second season, was followed for a period of 1.5 years (1994-1995), equivalent to 2 maize and 1 cowpea crop. Special attention was given to the role of the particulate organic matter (POM) in the cycling of urea-N through the soil organic matter (SOM). The maize crop recovered 26.5 and 1.7% of the applied urea-N at harvest in 1994 and 1995, respectively. The cowpea pods recovered only 0.7% of the applied urea-N at harvest. The highest proportion of applied urea-N recovered by the hedgerow occurred at 38 days after 1994 maize planting (DAP) (3.8%), while at later dates, recoveries of applied urea-N were always below 1%. This indicates that the Senna hedge is not a strong competitor for the applied urea-N during crop growth, i.e. while the Senna canopy is pruned at regular intervals. At 21 DAP, 12.7% of the applied urea-N was recovered in the surface litter and this value dropped significantly to 1.6% at 107 DAP and remained below 1% up to 480 DAP. The top 10 cm of soil contained 21% of the applied urea-N at 21 DAP and this value dropped to 9% at 480 DAP. Significantly more urea-N was recovered in the top 10 cm of soil than in the deeper soil layers at all sampling times. At 21 DAP, 11% of the applied urea-N was recovered in the 120-150 cm layer. This fast movement of urea-derived N to deep soil layers must have happened by preferential flow in macropores as the rainfall between urea application and the first sampling (74.2 mm) was not high enough to explain downward movement of N with the mobile water. Significant linear relationships between the proportion of urea-N in the different soil layers (excluding 0-10 cm) and the anion exchange capacity (AEC) and silt+clay content of the respective layers were found at 67, 107, 347 and 480 DAP. The total N content of the POM fraction increased significantly between 0 and 101 DAP from 127 to 171 mg N kg(-1) and decreased to 92 mg N kg(-1) at 480 DAP. The highest recovery of applied urea-N in the POM pool was measured at 101 DAP (3.6%) and this value decreased to 1.8% at 480 DAP. The total recovery of applied urea-N was 81% at 21 DAP, and decreased to values varying between 53 and 60% up from 38 to 347 DAP. At 480 DAP, the recovery decreased further to 47%. The fast movement of a substantial amount of urea-N may be responsible for this incomplete recovery, already at 21 DAP. Although the soil N status in the fertilized alley cropping system appears to be favourable for plant growth, this may be short-lived in the absence of further urea additions, as the soil-derived maize uptake in 1995 was already significantly lower than in 1994, and as the labile POM pool decreased significantly between the maize harvest in 1994 and 1995.

J	"Tsubo, M; Walker, S; Ogindo, HO"				"Tsubo, M; Walker, S; Ogindo, HO"			A simulation model of cereal-legume intercropping systems for semi-arid regions II. Model application	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"crop simulation; intercropping; Phaseolus vulgaris; risk analysis; Zea mays"	"MAIZE YIELD; RADIATION; PRODUCTIVITY; TEMPERATURE"	Smallholder farmers in Africa practice traditional cropping techniques such as intercropping. Intercropping is thought to offer higher productivity and resource milisation than sole cropping. In this study, risk associated with maize-bean intercropping was evaluated by quantifying long-term yield in both intercropping and sole cropping in a semi-arid region of South Africa (Bloemfontein, Free State) with reference to rainfall variability. The crop simulation model was run with different cultural practices (planting date and plant density) for 52 summer crop growing seasons (1950/1951-2001/2002). Eighty-one scenarios, consisted of three levels of initial soil water, planting date, maize population, and bean population, were simulated. From the simulation outputs, the total land equivalent ratio (LER) was greater than one. The intercrop (equivalent to sole maize) had greater energy value (EV) than sole beans, and the intercrop (equivalent to sole beans) had greater monetary value (MV) than sole maize. From these results, it can be concluded that maize-bean intercropping is advantageous for this semi-arid region. Soil water at planting was the most important factor of all scenario factors, followed by planting date. Irrigation application at planting, November/December planting and high plant density of maize for EV and beans for MV can be one of the most effective cultural practices in the study region. With regard to rainfall variability, seasonal (October-April) rainfall positively affected EV and MV, but not LER. There was more intercrop production in La Nina years than in El Nino years. Thus, better cultural practices may be selected to maximize maize-bean intercrop yields for specific seasons in the semi-arid region based on the global seasonal outlook. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

However, these systems are becoming less efficient and sustainable. This study therefore evaluated the profitability of soybean production systems as a function of the degree of diversification of crops grown in the winter period. We conducted an experiment in Parana state, Brazil, over 6 yr, under no-tillage. The crop rotation systems included soybean, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and combinations of tropical forage crops, either planted independently or intercropped with maize (Zea mays L.) in the winter. We evaluated the crop yields, gross revenue, total operating cost, gross margin, and profit of each production model. Diversified crop rotation systems increase crop yields and profit compared with the maize-soybean system. The most interesting crop rotations with respect to yield and profit proved to be those that substituted second crop maize for brachiaria ruziziensis (Urochloa ruziziensis) grass as a cover crop every 3 yr or intercropped second crop maize with brachiaria ruziziensis.

Energetics, Productivity and Profitability of Soybean (Glycine max)-Based Intercropping Systems under Different Planting Patterns	LEGUME RESEARCH			English	Article						"Economics; Energetics; Intercropping; Production efficiency; Soybean equivalent yield"	"CROPPING SYSTEMS; LEGUME; RATIO"	Background: Intercropping is an effective tool to enhance productivity, biodiversity and stability of the fragile agro-ecosystem. In the era of shrinking resources, intercropping based on pulse crops like soybean can play an important role in crop diversification as well as agricultural sustainability. But, the information on soybean based intercropping systems is limited and needs to be explored for north-west India. Methods: A field experiment was conducted during kharif seasons of 2015 and 2016 to evaluate the effect of different soybean based intercropping systems under different planting patterns on productivity, profitability and energetics. Soybean crop was planted as sole as well as in intercropping systems viz., soybean (45 cm) + mung bean (1:1), soybean (45 cm) + cowpea fodder (1:1), soybean (45 cm) + groundnut (1:1), soybean (45 cm) + maize fodder (1:1) , soybean (60 cm) + mash (1:1), soybean (60 cm) + mung bean (1:2), soybean (60 cm) + cowpea fodder (1:2), soybean (60 cm) + groundnut (1:2), soybean (60 cm) + maize fodder (1:2) and soybean (60 cm) + maize (grain) (1:1). Result: The pooled results over two years elucidated that soybean equivalent yield was affected significantly by different intercropping systems. Soybean (45 cm) + groundnut (1:1) produced the highest soybean equivalent yield and it was significantly better than all other systems except soybean (60 cm) + groundnut in 1:2 row ratio. Similar trend was followed by production efficiency. Both, soybean (45 cm) + groundnut (1:1) and soybean (60cm) + groundnut (1:2) systems produced significantly higher energy productivity as compared to sole soybean. The highest gross (Rs. 98185 /ha) and net returns (Rs. 56122/ha) were obtained in soybean (45 cm) + groundnut (1:1) intercropping system whereas the highest benefit cost ratio was obtained in soybean (60 cm) + maize fodder (1:2) system.

Straw and plastic management regulate air-soil temperature amplitude and wetting-drying alternation in soil to promote intercrop productivity in arid regions	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Intercropping; Straw and plastic management; Soil temperature; Soil moisture; Arid regions"	"WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; CROP PRODUCTIVITY; MAIZE YIELD; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LOESS PLATEAU; RIDGE-FURROW; GRAIN-YIELD; BARE SOIL; GROWTH; WHEAT"	Soil coverage with straw and plastic mulch is a valuable and useful strategy for enhancing crop production in arid regions. However, a better understanding of the mechanism by which this innovative practice drives spatial and temporal variation in soil temperature and water content and improves crop production could guide cropping system optimization. A three-year field experiment was performed with four wheat-maize strip-intercropping treatments: 1) no-tillage with 25 - 30 cm tall wheat straw standing in wheat strips and residual plastic mulching in maize strips (NTS), 2) no-tillage with 25 - 30 cm tall wheat straw mulching in wheat strips and residual plastic mulching in maize strips (NTM), 3) conventional tillage with 25 - 30 cm tall wheat straw incorporation in wheat strips and annual new plastic mulching in maize strips (CTS), and 4) conventional tillage without wheat straw retention in wheat strips and annual new plastic mulching in maize strips (CT). The temporal and spatial variation in soil temperature and soil water content was assessed. NTM had the greatest soil water retention, and increased soil water content in the 0-120 cm soil depth by 6.4, 5.2, and 5.4 % at the wheat independent growing period, intercrops co-growing period, and maize independent growing period, respectively, compared with CT. In the 0-15 cm soil depth, compared with CT, NTS decreased soil temperature by 0.73, 1.18, and 0.85 degrees C, NTM decreased it by 1.35, 1.95, and 1.38 degrees C, during the three aforementioned crop growing periods. With the intercropping treatment, soil temperature in the 0 -15 cm soil depth of maize strips was higher than that of wheat strips with NTS by 1.13, 3.67, and 1.44 degrees C, and with NTM higher by 1.32, 2.97, and 1.75 degrees C, especially higher as 1.38, 4.00,and 1.68 degrees C with CT, during the three aforementioned crop growing periods. According to the value of difference between air and soil temperatures, NTM maintained soil heat in the low temperature season and reduced soil temperature in the high temperature season. These allowed the intercrops to grow in a collaborative state with the NTM treatment during their growing period, it is an important regulation mechanism for growth and development of intercropped wheat and maize. NTM improved total grain yield of wheat plus maize by 14.9 % in comparison to CT. The optimized soil temperature and increased soil moisture for the intercrops' strips with NTM indicates that the integrated set of practices in this treatment can be used as a superior technique to overcome simultaneous water shortage and heat stress in arid irrigated areas of northwestern China.

Effect of nitrogen fertilization on yield, intercropping indices and produce quality of different soybean (Glycine max) plus cereal intercropping systems	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article								A field experiment was carried out during the rainy (kharit) seasons of 2009 and 2010 at New Delhi, to study the effect of nitrogen levels on yield, competition and produce quality of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and intercrops. The sole crop of soybean recorded higher seed yield as compared to intercropping. Among the inter cropping systems, soybean + maize (Zea mays L.) recorded the highest yield of soybean. Incremental N levels to cereal crops showed negative impact on the yield of soybean. While the yield of intercropped maize significantly increased with up to 100% recommended dose of nitrogen (RDN), the yield of intercropped sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.] and pearlmillet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R.Br. Stuntz] increased only up to 75 and 50% RDN respectively. Soybean + maize intercropping supplied with 100% RDN gave the highest net returns and soybean equivalent yield. The aggressivity and competitive ratio were higher for pearlmillet and sorghum than maize. The protein and nitrogen content in seed, N content in stover and total N uptake in intercropped maize were higher with 75-100% RDN, while these parameters increased only up to 75% RDN in intercropped sorghum. In pearlmillet, protein and N content in seed were significantly higher with 75% RDN, while total uptake of N was higher with 50% RDN than lower N levels. The optimum doses of N for intercrops were 66.6 and 70.7 kg/ha for maize, 54.0 and 56.7 kg/ha for sorghum and 35.5 and 31.6 kg/ha for pearlmillet, in 2009 and 2010 respectively.

That these practices' effects on crop population genetics have not been quantified bespeaks lack of an appropriate analytical framework. We use a model that construes seed-management practices as part of a crop's demography to describe the dynamics of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) in Cauca, Colombia. We quantify several management practices for cassava-the first estimates of their kind for a vegetatively-propagated crop-describe their demographic repercussions, and compare them to those of maize, a sexually-reproduced grain crop. We discuss the implications for gene flow, the conservation of cassava diversity, and the biosafety of vegetatively-propagated crops in centers of diversity. Cassava populations are surprisingly open and dynamic: farmers exchange germplasm across localities, particularly improved varieties, and distribute it among neighbors at extremely high rates vis-a-vis maize. This implies that a large portion of cassava populations consists of non-local germplasm, often grown in mixed stands with local varieties. Gene flow from this germplasm into local seed banks and gene pools via pollen has been documented, but its extent remains uncertain. In sum, cassava's biology and vegetative propagation might facilitate pre-release confinement of genetically-modified varieties, as expected, but simultaneously contribute to their diffusion across traditional agroecosystems if released. Genetically-modified cassava is unlikely to displace landraces or compromise their diversity; but rapid diffusion of improved germplasm and subsequent incorporation into cassava landraces, seed banks or wild populations could obstruct the tracking and eradication of deleterious transgenes. Attempts to regulate traditional farming practices to reduce the risks could compromise cassava populations' adaptive potential and ultimately prove ineffectual."

J	"Laloy, E; Bielders, CL"				"Laloy, E.; Bielders, C. L."			Modelling intercrop management impact on runoff and erosion in a continuous maize cropping system: Part I. Model description, global sensitivity analysis and Bayesian estimation of parameter identifiability	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article							"SOIL SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; EUROSEM; SIMULATION; GENERATION; VARIABILITY; ERODIBILITY; FLOW"	In order to evaluate the long-term impact of intercrop management on runoff and erosion in a continuous maize cropping system a new model was developed, based on the continuous plot-scale runoff model of Laloy & Bielders (2008). This model is called the Continuous Runoff and Erosion Hillslope model with DYnamic soil Surface properties (CREHDYS). This paper details the erosion and crop growth and decay model components and presents a thorough global variance-based sensitivity analysis (GSA) with regard to the erosion prediction, followed by a Bayesian parameter identifiability assessment. As compared with the classical local univariate sensitivity analysis, a GSA is able to deal with the typical non-linearity of process-based hydrological and erosion models. The most influential parameters were the Manning's roughness coefficient followed by the saturated hydraulic conductivity of wheel track cells and the median particle size of the material. The soil aggregate stability and soil-cohesion parameters were found to be almost non-influential. Most of the results of the parameter identifiability procedure were in close agreement with the GSA. Indeed, the parameter uncertainty seemed to be proportional to the degree of influence, with Manning's coefficient being the most precisely identified, whereas soil and wheel track cohesion parameters showed the largest uncertainty. Exceptions were the soil aggregate stability and the Green-Ampt soil matric potential. The uncertainty associated with the former was surprisingly low given its low level of influence whereas the uncertainty associated with the latter is partially explained by its negative correlation with the soil saturated hydraulic conductivities of overland flow and wheel track cells.

Root litter is an important source of soil organic matter, but its link with soil nutritional status in forage mixtures is not clear. This study was aimed to uncover whether the relationship of carbon (C) and nutrients between root and soil would change with mixing ratio. Changes in organic C, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) of root and soil were studied in a 2-year experiment with sole common vetch (Vicia sativa), sole oat (Avena sativa), and their mixtures of different mixing ratios under N, P, and N + P fertilization. Root C, N, and P concentrations decreased with decreasing proportion of common vetch in the grasslands. Nitrogen fertilization significantly improved root N concentration (by 4.5-10.1%), while P fertilization decreased root N concentration (by 10.1-18.4%). The effect of mixing ratio on soil C and nutrients was stimulated by fertilization, although soil C, N, and P contents barely changed with mixing ratio. Mixing and fertilization significantly affected C, N, and P stoichiometric ratios of root and soil (besides soil C:N). Soil C, N, and P contents were strongly positively correlated with root C concentration. The results indicated that increasing legume proportion in the mixture may improve root C and nutrients, which can be stimulated by fertilization.

J	"Jannasch, RW; Martin, RC"				"Jannasch, RW; Martin, RC"			The potential for capturing the forage yield of white lupin by intercropping with cereals	BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE & HORTICULTURE			English	Article							"ALBUS L; PHOSPHORUS; SYSTEMS; ROOT"	The usefulness of sweet white lupin (Lupinus albus L.) as a grain legume in Atlantic Canada is limited by excessive vegetative growth and late and uneven seed maturity. Lupins were intercropped for silage with oat (Avena sativa L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) or maize (Zea mays L.) at Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada, to evaluate dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) yields and forage percent DM. Oat and wheat were intercropped with lupin at either 100% of the regular monocrop lupin population plus 50% of the monocrop cereal population (L-MED) or at 75% of the monocrop populations of both crops (L-LOW). Lupin and cereal were sown either simultaneously (S-sown) or with cereal planting delayed 4 weeks (D-sown) in a complete two x two x two factorial. Lupin and maize were intercropped in a separate two x two factorial at two row spacings (in alternate 38-cm rows or in the same 76-cm rows) and at the same two population densities as the small grain cereal intercrops. Biomass and CP yields of lupin monocrops and D-sown intercrops were not different, but D-sown cereal yields were substantially reduced from their monocrops. Total biomass yields of S-sown oat and wheat intercrops ranged from 6030-6790 kg ha(-1) in 1991 and 8710-9940 kg ha(-1) in 1992 compared with lupin monocrop yields of 5910-8120 kg ha-(1.) Percent dry matter (DM) of S-planted intercrops was within the acceptable range for ensiling. Population and cereal species had significant main effects on DM and CP yields of component species only. Yields of maize intercrops ranged from 7410 to 9980 kg ha(-1) while the maize monocrop averaged 14500 kg ha(-1). Land Equivalent Ratios (LERs) for DM of the S-sown, L-MED intercrop were 1.27 and 1.16 in 1991 and 1992, respectively, while the corresponding LERs for CP were 1.53 and 1.40. Dry matter LERs for S-planted oat intercrops ranged from 1.00-1.08, but maize LERs were less than one in 1991. Increased land use efficiency and acceptable forage DM levels indicate lupin/wheat intercrops have promise as a silage crop.

In order to contribute to controlling B. tabaci by non-chemical methods, we examined the possibility of using a combination of trap/barrier crops and a parasitoid natural enemy in cotton. We performed field experiments using cantaloupe (Cucumis melo) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus) as trap crops and maize (Zea mays) as a barrier crop combined with periodic releases of the parasitoid Eretmocerus hayati in Hebei Province, Northern China. All treatments significantly reduced immature whitefly densities. Parasitism rate was significantly higher in cotton plots intercropped with sunflower and with perimeter-planted cantaloupe. Adult whitefly density was negatively related to parasitoid abundance and was significantly lower in cotton plots intercropped with maize than in the control plots. Intercropping was more effective than perimeter-planting at reducing B. tabaci densities and increasing yield. Parasitoid dispersal was not hampered by barrier crops, indicating that the two methods of control are compatible. These results contribute to the development of integrated pest management methods against this important pest.

A random block design with four replications was used. The highest yield was found in maize (P < 0.001) followed by dolichos. The greatest amounts of total forage was with the brachiaria + maize systems (19.07 t DM/ha) and brachiaria + dolichos (18.95 t DM/ha) which were superior t(P < 0.01) to the remaining treatments. The control treatment had the lowest yield (12.91 t DM/ha). The percentage of pasture at the end of the experiment was good in all treatment, although where maize was sown this lower than the control (P < 0.01). Oats, soybean and dolichos presented higher protein and phosphorus contents than brachiaria and maize. It is concluded that intercropping of dolichos in brachiaria produced the best performance and as an option maize, oats and soybean are considered in this system.

To this aim, we investigate the effects of different fertilizers on various P fractions in relation to the rhizosphere-microbial processes in a cowpea/maize intercropping system. Field experiments were conducted during two consecutive years (2016-2017) in a split-plot design by establishing cowpea/maize alone or intercropped onto the main plot, while the sub-plot was treated with four types of fertilization, i.e. no fertilizer addition (control), organic amendment (compost), mineral fertilizers (NPK) and multi-nutrient enriched compost (NPKEC). Our results showed that NPKEC fertilizer increased NaHCO3-P-i by 69% in maize, 62% in cowpea and 93% in intercropped plots compared to control plots. Similarly, a significant increase in the NaHCO3-P-o fraction was also recorded with NPKEC treatment in all cropping systems. In case of moderately labile P, NPKEC fertilizer caused the highest increase of NaOH-P-o (12.87 +/- 0.50 mg P kg(-1) soil) and NaOH-P-i (22.29 +/- 0.83 mg P kg(-1) soil) fractions in intercropped plots. Except for intercropping, NPK application caused an increase in the non-available P fraction (HCl-P-i), while the use of NPKEC decreased the HCl-P-i concentration in all cropping systems, suggesting stronger merits both for intercropping and NPKEC. Surprisingly, maize exhibited substantially higher phosphatases activity compared to cowpea in monoculture amended with compost, implying distinct crop strategies for adaptation under low P conditions. Based on the multi-factor analysis, the close association of NaHCO3-P with P solubilizing bacteria, root carboxylates and pH indicated that rhizosphere processes are the strongest predictors of immediately available P. Since alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a P-degrading enzyme of microbial origin, rhizosphere related ALP association may have originated from root-associated microflora promoting P mobilization. Furthermore, the strong association of microbial biomass P (MBP) and acid phosphates (ACP) with NaOH-P fraction indicated moderately available P cycle in soil was mainly driven by microbial-related processes. Factor analysis map and two-way ANOVA confirmed that fertilization regime had a stronger effect on all tested variables compared to cropping system. Altogether, our results suggest that a combination of microbial-rhizosphere processes controls the dynamics of P fertility in semi-arid soils. In the broader context of improving soil P fertility, it is highly recommended the use of environmentally sustainable sources of fertilizer, such as NPKEC, which can enhance the competitive performance of legume-cereal intercropping under semi-arid agroecosystems.

These mixtures are limited by drought, which is frequent in Morocco due to lack of and poor distribution of rain. However, annual Medicago species are very important to forage production, and they have a tolerance to water stress. The effect of water stress on N-2 fixation and N transfer by Medicago truncatula cv. Jemalong (medic), when mixed with wheat (Triticum durum cv. Karim), was investigated in three greenhouse experiments. Annual medic and wheat were seeded in 20-L pots in pure and mixed stands. Three watering treatments were used: -0.9, -1.5, and -2.5 MPa in the first experiment; and -0.9, -2.5, and -3.5 MPa in the second and third experiments. Competition between medic and wheat was affected by hydric treatments; the medic was more competitive for soil water than the wheat, especially under severe water stress. Shoot dry weight of wheat grown with medic was higher than that of wheat grown in pure stands. Medic alone took up more soil N than wheat alone, while in the mixture, medic took up less soil N than wheat, indicating that the mixed medic was not competing for soil mineral N. Using the N-15 dilution technique, it was found that medic N-15 concentration was lower than that of the wheat in all treatments, suggesting active N-2 fixation. Apparently, the medic obtained from 20% to 73% of its N from the atmosphere, depending on the water regime. The atoms-percent excess N-15 in medic decreased significantly in the mixture, showing higher N-2 fixation (N-15 dilution method) than in pure medic. Mixed medic derived 82% of its N from fixation at severe water stress (T-2) and 92% at the control (T-0), showing that N-2 fixation by medic was less affected by water stress in the mixed stand than in the pure stand. In the first experiment, N transfer was detected only in the control treatment, but in the second and third experiments, transfer of N was significant (p = 0.05)."

Assessing the value of diverse cropping systems under a new agricultural policy environment in Rwanda	FOOD SECURITY			English	Article						"Agriculture-nutrition; Agrobiodiversity; Intercrop; Resilience; Traditional knowledge"	"DIETARY DIVERSITY; NUTRITIONAL QUALITY; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; FOOD SECURITY; BIODIVERSITY; RESILIENCE; PRODUCTIVITY; AGROBIODIVERSITY; SUSTAINABILITY; MANAGEMENT"	In Rwanda, farmers' traditional farming systems based on intercropping and varietal mixtures are designed to meet a variety of livelihood objectives and withstand risks associated with fluctuation in market and agro-climatic conditions. However, these mixed systems have been disappearing since 2008 when government mandated intensification strategies. In this paper we use a mixed methods approach to evaluate intercropping and sole cropping systems against farmers' criteria for success: yield, market value, contribution to nutritional quality, and land-use efficiency. We used qualitative interviews to understand the criteria by which farmers evaluate cropping systems, and data from crop trials to assess common bean ((Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and maize (Zea mays L.)) sole crops and intercrops against those criteria. We found that an improved intercropping system tends to outperform the government-mandated system of alternating sole-cropped bean and maize season-by-season, on all four of the criteria tested. Although Rwanda's agricultural intensification strategy aims to improve rural livelihoods through agricultural modernization, it fails to acknowledge the multiple and currently non-replaceable benefits that diverse cropping systems provide, particularly food security and risk management. Agricultural policies need to be based on a better understanding of smallholders' objectives and constraints. Efforts to improve farming systems require innovative and inclusive approaches that enable adaptation to the socio-ecological context.

'Alfred') and barley (cv. 'Baronesse') with different seed densities and different proportions of both species were tested in Wulfsdorf for their agronomic practicability. Leaf diseases like powdery mildew on oars and barley, respectively, and rust of barley (Puccinia hordei) were reduced distinctly in mixed stands. Furthermore, it was measured that mixtures of oats and barley with appropriate seed densities of 350 n/m(2) and seed proportions, which favour barley, can suppress weed infestations to an extend that exceed significantly the yield expected from the results of the pure stands measurements.

FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY			English	Article						"density; intraspecific competition; land equivalent ratio; row configuration; yield"	"YIELD ADVANTAGE; MAIZE HYBRIDS; ASYMMETRIC COMPETITION; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; PLANT-POPULATION; USE EFFICIENCY; NITROGEN; WATER; PRODUCTIVITY; DEPENDENCE"	Dominant species in intercropping experience less resource competition compared with its monoculture. This reduced competition for resources may allow cultivating the dominant species at an increased density in intercropping to obtain greater yield. However, experimental results are inconclusive when the optimal within row density in the sole crop is not well established. Here, we conducted a two-year experiment to test the hypothesis that optimal within row plant density of dominant species in intercropping would be higher in the intercrop than in the sole crop. We tested three maize densities (3, 4.5, and 6 plants m(-1)) in both sole maize and two replacement designed intercrops. The row configurations of two intercrops are two rows maize intercropped with four rows peanut (M2P4) and four rows maize intercropped with four rows peanut (M4P4). Peanut was grown at the same plant density of 12 plants m(-1) row in both sole crop and intercrops. The results indicated that increasing maize density from the optimal density in monoculture is not worthy of promotion to improve yield in intercropping, which denied our hypothesis. The land equivalent ratios (LER) in the dry year (2017) were higher than the wet year (2016). Maize yields per unit area of the whole intercropping system were highest with densities of 4.5 and 6 plants m(-1) row, with no significant difference between these two densities. Maximum maize yields in sole cropping were obtained with maize densities of 6 plants m(-1) row. Intercropping provided higher yields at low and intermediate sole crop maize densities, but not at high sole crop maize density. Average land equivalent ratios at 3, 4.5, and 6 plants m(-1) of maize were 1.09, 1.04, and 0.95 in 2016, and 1.07, 1.10, and 1.02 in 2017. Our results suggest that intercropping performs better at conditions with less resources than adequate resources.

Sorghum-soybean intercropping is a way to increase productivity but reduction in the yield of component crops owing to severe competition continues to remains a biggest challenge. A multi-year field trial was executed to assess the productivity of sorghum-soybean intercropping systems sown at varied times (sorghum and soybean sown simultaneously, sorghum sown 18 days prior to soybean and vice versa) and spatial arrangements (sorghum-soybean sown in 4:1, 4:4, 2:1 and 2:2 row proportions). Factorial arrangement of randomized complete block design was used to conduct the field trials with four replicates. Agronomic variables of forage sorghum (plant height, stem diameter, number of leaves, plant leaf area, fresh and dry weights per plant) were positively affected when it was sown 18 days earlier to soybean in 2: 1 row proportion. The same intercropping system gave significantly (p<0.01) higher green forage yield, dry biomass of sorghum along with mixed (sorghum+ soybean) green forage yield and dry biomass yield. However, soybean green and dry biomass yields remained unmatched when it was sown 18 days earlier to sorghum in 2:1 row proportion. Thus, delayed sowing of one of the intercrops for 18 days has the potential to yield higher forage of component crops and this type of intercropping might be suggested depending upon the availability of irrigation water and its fitness into the prevailing cropping system.

A field experiment conducted in northwest China in 2013 and 2014 examined four intercropping systems (oilseed rape/maize, oilseed rape/soybean, potato/maize, and soybean/potato) and the corresponding monocultures. Total dry matter data collected every 20 d after maize emergence were fitted to logistic models to investigate the temporal dynamics of crop growth and interspecific interactions. All four intercropping systems showed significant yield advantages. Temporal niche complementarity between intercropped species was due to differences in sowing and harvesting dates or the time taken to reach maximum daily growth rate or both. Interspecific interactions between intercropped species amplified temporal niche differentiation as indicated by postponement of the time taken to reach maximum daily growth rate of late-maturing crops (i.e. 21 to 41 days in maize associated with oilseed rape or potato). Growth trajectories of intercropped maize or soybean recovered after the oilseed rape harvest to the same values as in their monoculture on a per plant basis. Amplified niche differentiation between crop species depends on the identity of neighboring species whose relative growth rate is crucial in determining the differentiation.

The relative control efficacies of the intercropping between wheat and maize were 16.7%-45.7% for stripe rust and 14.7%-37.0% for powdery mildew compared to the pure stands of wheat. The yield increased by 52.4%-140.0%. The relative control efficacies of intercropping between wheat and sunflower were 5.9%-28.9% for stripe rust and 11.7%-18.4% for powdery mildew. The yield increased by -1.4%-24.8%. The differences were statistically significant for control efficacy. Therefore, intercropping systems could be used extensively in South Gansu, where machinery is seldom-used due to the mountainous landscape, to reduce damage caused by the two major diseases. The intercropping system of wheat with potato or chili did not result in significant differences in disease reduction compared to the pure wheat stands. However, the two crop combinations increased the yield by 150.0% or more. Other intercropping combinations did not result in a significant disease reduction or yield increase.

However, only few studies have explored it from the perspective of organic nitrogen (N) uptake, especially under the rapid development of organic and no-tillage farming worldwide. In this study, two cereals (Triticum aestivum and Zea mays) and two legumes (Glycine max and Pisum sativum) were mono-and intercropped using microcosm experiments in a greenhouse, with a total of 10 combinations. The uptake pattern of in situ N-15-labelled glycine by plants in each combination was investigated. The total biomass of wheat increased 1.6 times when intercropped with soybean, compared to its monoculture, but not at the expense of reduced soybean growth. Root:shoot ratios of maize increased 1.3 times when intercropped with pea compared with its monoculture. Intercropping with soybean decreased the uptake rates of N-15-labelled glycine by wheat compared to its monoculture. Although intercropping with other species increased the root:shoot in maize, it did not increase the glycine-derived 15N uptake rates. We conclude that interactions between agricultural plants are species-specific and can alter the uptake of N-derived from organic forms.

Effect of silage from ryegrass intercropped with winter or common vetch for grazing dairy cows in small-scale dairy systems in Mexico	TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION			English	Article						"Small-scale dairy systems; Annual ryegrass-vetch silage; Maize silage; Grazing; Highlands; Mexico"	"LOLIUM-MULTIFLORUM; FEEDING STRATEGIES; MILK-PRODUCTION; MAIZE SILAGE; HIGHLANDS; PERFORMANCE; MIXTURES; PASTURE; LEGUME"	"The objective was to determine the effect of including silages of annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) intercropped with winter vetch (Vicia villosa) (ARG-VV) or with common vetch (Vicia sativa) (ARG-VS) compared with maize silage (MS) on milk yield and milk composition of dairy cows grazing cultivated perennial ryegrass-white clover pastures with supplemented concentrate during the dry season. Six Holstein dairy cows with a mean yield of 19.0 kg/cow/day at the beginning of the experiment were randomly assigned to a 3 x 3 repeated Latin square. Treatments were: 8 h/day intensive grazing, 3.6 kg of dry matter (DM) per cow per day of concentrate plus MS, and ARG-VV or ARG-VS ad libitum at a stocking rate of 3.0 cows/ha for three experimental periods of 3 weeks each. Milk yield (MY) and milk composition, live weight and body condition score as well as silage and concentrate intakes were recorded during the third week of each experimental period, and pasture intake was estimated indirectly from utilised metabolisable energy. Economic analysis was obtained by preparing partial budgets. There were no statistical differences (P > 0.10) in MY, milk fat or protein content nor for live weight, but there was significant difference (P < 0.10) in body condition score. There were non-statistical differences in silage DM intake (P < 0.11); however, significant differences (P < 0.10) were obtained for estimated grazed herbage intake whilst no differences for total DM intake. Slightly higher economic returns (10%) were obtained with ARG-VS over MS, and this was 7% higher than ARG-VV. It is concluded that ARG-VS could be an option for complementing grazing for small-scale dairy production systems in the dry season as it is comparable to MS in animal performance and slightly better in economic terms."

The insufficient light accordingly causes slow growth and development of vines and leaves of sweet potato in its early stage. The planting density and row direction of maize, the width of the intercropping strip, and the lodging type of sweet potato may form various photo conditions that influence sweet potato. The objective of this experiment was to research the effects of different ridging types on sweet potato and to elucidate the mechanisms of ecological conditions, photosynthetic physiology and intercropping benefits. The results indicated that, contrast to the one wide-ridge with planting two rows of sweet potato and two narrow ridges with planting two rows, mound planting was more superior in many aspects. Through mound planting sweet potato showed a larger range of temperature in air and soil, higher net photosynthetic rate, more active enzymes related with photosynthesis, and more benefits of relay intercropping.

Soil physical and chemical properties under continuous maize cultivation as influenced by hedgerow trees species on an alfisol in South Western Nigeria	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						"Hedgerow; alley cropping; hydraulic conductivity; Pterocarpus; Gliricidia; Leucaena; Enterolobium; cone penetrometer resistance; field capacity"	"ALLEY; LEUCAENA; SYSTEMS"	In the sub-humid tropical Africa, the pressure of diminishing land resources resulting from the rapidly increasing population has made the traditional fallow systems used for the replenishing soil fertility impossible. Alley cropping has been suggested as an alternative to bush fallowing. This study evaluated the effects of 20 years of different species of hedgerow crops on the physical and chemical properties of soil. Soil physical and chemical properties were studied under Pterocarpus santalinoides, Gliricidia sepium, Enterolobium cyclocarpum and Leucaena and leucocephala intercropped with maize (Zea mays L.) at a 20 years old Leventis Foundation Farm, at Ilesa in the south western part of Nigeria. Soil bulk density was significantly reduced under the hedgerow species from a maximum of 1.52 g cm(-3) under control to 1.33 g cm(-3) under Pterocarpus and Enterolobium hedgerows. While the soil cone penetrometer resistance index followed a similar trend, the soil field capacity was lowest under Pterocarpus and highest under Leucaena hedgerows. Soil porosity increased significantly (p < 0.05) from 0.38 under control to a maximum of 0.47 under Pterocarpus, while the hydraulic conductivity at a suction of -0.5 cm was significantly highest Gliricidia hedgerow. Soil pH and other chemical properties were consistently highest under Leucaena and consistently Gliricidia hedgerow. Overall among the screened hedgerow species, G. sepium showed the best promise in terms of improvement in both soil physical and chemical properties.	"[Awotoye, O.

A field experiment was conducted during two consecutive seasons of rabi 2011-13 at Dr. Norman E. Borlaug Crop Research Centre of G.B. Pant University ofAgriculture and Technology, Pantnagar to find out the effect of planting pattern and weed management practices on growth, development and yield of field pea and baby corn in field pea (Pant P-13) + baby corn (Surya) intercropping system. The experiment was laid out in split plot design keeping four planting patterns as main plot and four weed management practices as sub plot with three replications. Most of the growth parameters viz, number of branches per plant, dry matter accumulation (g/plant), crop growth rate and relative growth rate of field pea were comparatively higher under sole planting of field pea as compared to intercropping systems. Sole planting of field pea recorded significantly higher grain (2264 and 1434 kg ha(-1)) and straw yields (3263 and 2540 kg ha-1) during 2011-12 and 2012-2013 than yield obtained as a component crop in paired planting of maize (30/60 cm) + field pea (2:2) and planting of maize + field pea (1:1). Baby corn yield was similar in sole, paired (2:2) and 1:1 planting but significantly higher stover yield of baby corn (3576 kg ha-land 3533 kg ha(-1), during 2011-12 and 2012-2013 respectively) was obtained from sole crop than other planting methods during both the years. Hand weeding at 30 days after sowing, pre emergence application of pendimethalin 1 kg ha(-1) and post emergence application of imazethapyr 50 g ha(-1) 30 days after sowing improved all the growth and yield parameters of field pea and baby corn than weedy check.

J	Ghosh, PK				Ghosh, PK			Growth, yield, competition and economics of groundnut/cereal fodder intercropping systems in the semi-arid tropics of India	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Zea mays; Sorghum bicolor; Pennisetum glaucum; Arachis hypogaea; cereal fodder; fodder yield; intensity of cutting; intercrops; competition indices"	"PEARL-MILLET-GROUNDNUT; MAIZE; PEANUT; OHASHI; OHWI"	Intercropping legumes with non-legume crops during the rainy season (wet season) is a common practice in the semi-arid tropics of India. Of late, the concept of intercropping has also been utilized in irrigated (dry season) situations. In a 2-year field study during the dry season (February-May), we assessed yield, competition and economics in a groundnut/cereal fodder intercropping system compared with monocropped groundnut. Maize (Zea mays L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.) were grown for fodder. One cutting for all and two cuttings (first at 50 days after sowing and second at 95 days after sowing) for sorghum and pearl millet were made. In intercrops one row of cereal fodder was sown between every three rows of groundnut (1:3). The green fodder yields and pod yield of groundnut were lower in intercropped than in monoculture plots. The highest green fodder yield in intercrops was recorded in pearl millet with two cuts (16.5 t ha(-1)) followed by pearl millet with one cut (11.8 t ha(-1)) and sorghum with two cuts (10.7 t ha(-1)). In intercrops the growth and yield of groundnut were affected by cereal fodder and intensity of cutting. A significant (*P < 0.05) reduction in leaf area index (LAI) and crop growth rate (CGR) was observed in the groundnut-pearl millet system over sole groundnut. Decrease in nodule mass at pod filling stages in groundnut ranged from 3.5 to 11.0% when intercropped with cereal fodders compared to sole groundnut crop. Groundnut yield was reduced more due to pearl millet and sorghum with two cuts. However, maize as the associated crop produced 9.0 t green fodder ha(-1) and affected the groundnut less with respect to pod yield (5.76% reduction), yield attributes, CGR, LAI and nodule dry mass. Of the two Cutting situations under intercropping, one cut gave 9.9% higher yield of groundnut as compared to two cuts. A higher land equivalent ratio (LER) and relative crowding coefficient (RCC) value leads to a crop yield advantage. Accordingly, yield advantage was greater in case of the groundnut/maize association. The competition ratio (CR) is a better indication of performance than RCC. The CRs of pearl millet and sorghum with two cuts were greater than maize but the corresponding CRs of groundnut were less. Thus, pearl millet and sorghum were more competitive, and groundnut under these two crops was affected more. The maximum monetary advantage was also recorded for the groundnut/maize intercropping system. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Cropping intensities and crop yields are low and unstable in these areas due to unpredictable patterns of rainfall, a host of biotic and abiotic stresses and adherence to traditional farm practices. This precarious food security situation is especially dangerous in the central Indian tribal belt (also known as the poverty belt) which is a typical rainfed area dominated by tribal communities. More than 90% of the tribal people are totally dependent on agriculture and produce much of what they eat. Small land holdings and their low productivity, along with uncertainties in rainfall patterns, increases economic and social risks for these farmers. With degraded soils and unreliable weather patterns, return on investment is uncertain and likely to be much lower overall than under irrigated conditions with better soils. Under such conditions, one approach to achieve improved crop production is to minimize soil and other natural resource degradation by adopting a set of crop-nutrient-water-land system management practices, such as conservation agriculture (CA). To assess the effect of introduced technology under local ecological and socio-economic conditions, the study focused on two ecosystem services: a) provisional, and b) regulatory through five treatments consisting of farmers' traditional practice (FP) which was conventional tillage with broadcast of local variety maize (Zea mays L); and four CA treatments viz., conventional tillage with sole cropped maize using line sowing of the improved maize cultivar 'Nilesh' (CT-M); conventional tillage with maize intercropped with the improved cowpea (Vig na unguiculata L cultivar 'Hariyalli Bush') (CT-M + C); reduced tillage with sole cropped maize (MT-M); and reduced tillage with maize + cowpea (MT-M + C). After harvest of maize and cowpea, mustard was planted as a post rainy season crop and all the mustard plant residues were returned to their respective plots as residue cover except FP. Under provisional ecosystem services, performance of CA on crop yield, and profitability was assessed through maize equivalent yield and partial budget analysis, respectively. Results showed that reduced tillage combined with maize-cowpea intercropping (MT-M + C) followed by mustard residue retention had higher system productivity and net benefits, an increase of 200% and 230%, respectively over FP. Under regulatory ecosystem services, the soil quality was assessed through calculation of soil quality index (SQI) which was highest under MT-M + C followed by mustard residue retention and lowest under farmers' practices. In terms of CA treatment preference, 35% of the farmers indicated a strong preference for MT-M + C compared to 14% for FP. Combined, these results clearly demonstrate the potential of CA to simultaneously increase yield, diversify crop production and improve soil quality which should support a move towards sustainable intensification of crop production to improve future household income and food security. Additionally, using a transdisciplinary approach fully engaged all stakeholders in co-designing the CA treatments appropriate for the farmers and local environmental conditions leading to significant impacts on economic livelihoods, environmental sustainability and food security.

COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE			English	Article						"adoption; complementarity; substitutability; AFRINT II; sustainable agricultural practices; multivariate probit; Ghana"	"CONSERVATION TILLAGE; ADOPTION; IMPACTS; CROP"	Sustainable Agricultural Practices (SAPs) have been promoted over the years as a means of ensuring sustainable development in the agricultural sector. However, adoption has generally been low across countries. This paper explores the linkages among SAPs and adoption decisions of SAPs among smallholder maize farm households in Ghana. The study used a household-level data on 394 farmers collected by the second round of the intensification of food crops agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa (AFRINT II) in Ghana. We employed a multivariate regression model to investigate the complementarity and the substitutability among the selected elements of SAPs as well as the simultaneous determinants of the SAPs components. We found out that some elements of the SAPs are complementary, while others are substitutes. The results also suggest that access to input credit, membership of farmer-based organizations, extension contact, and formal education, as well as intercropping, lead to the adoption of SAPs. The study recommends that SAP programmes that support the application of one technology (e.g., inorganic fertilizer) must provide simultaneous support for intercropping with nitrogen-fixing plants. Also, investment in public education is crucial in boosting farmers' knowledge of agricultural practices. Lastly, the positive and significant policy variables such as FBO suggest that focusing on strengthening community social network institutions is one other way of improving adoption decisions of SAPs.

Rainfall, temperature and wind are identified as key weather components in virus pathosystems involving maize (cereal), okra (vegetable) and cassava (tuber crop), and are therefore important in determining the most suitable period in which to undertake crop protection measures. The intricate interrelationships among cropping seasons, intercrop periods and virus incidence in West Africa must be thoroughly understood in order to develop ecologically-based and sustainable management practices. This calls for a greater cooperation between agrometeorologists and those involved in crop protection.

A field experiment was conducted on maize (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] relay intercropping and corresponding monocultures in Southwest China in 2012 to 2013. Differences were observed in crop productivity, weed diversity, and weed biomass. Grain yield and aboveground biomass for maize did not differ between intercropped and monocultured maize; however, they were lower for soybean in intercropping compared to soybean in monoculture (SM). Greater decreases were evident for the intercropping of one row of soybean alternated with one row of maize (MSRI1) (-46% for yield and -55% for biomass) than the intercropping of two rows of soybean alternated with two rows of maize (MSRI2) (-10% for yield and -27% for biomass). The total grain yield and aboveground biomass in MSRI2 were higher than those in MSRI1 (5.9% for yield and 6.4% for biomass), monoculture maize (MM, 16% for yield and 24% for biomass), and SM (394% for yield and 227% for biomass). Weed diversity and biomass in the intercropped phase were lower in MSRI1 and MSRI2 than in MM and SM, and the total weed biomass during the entire growing season also decreased in intercropping as compared with monocultures and fallow, with decreases of 28, 40, and 60% in MSRI1 and 29, 41, and 61% in MSRI2 compared with MM, SM, and fallow, respectively. In addition, more light was also captured by intercrops than by those in monoculture and fallow. Correlation analysis suggested that crop diversity suppressed weed growth by increasing the interception of light by crops."

However, the optimal sowing time for forage species in these cropping systems is unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of two sowing times of palisade and guinea grass on forage production and quality, soybean yield and soil chemical properties. Palisade and guinea grasses were sown for intercropping with maize or after maize silage harvest (hereafter succession) in an experiment carried out over three crop seasons. We evaluated forage dry matter production, pasture nutritive values, straw nutrient content, soybean leaf nutrients, yield, and soil fertility. The highest dry matter production was 8.1 Mg ha(-1)for guinea grass in the intercropping system (sum of 3 cuts). Sowing forage after maize silage harvest provided 4% more crude protein compared with intercropping, regardless of grass species. Soybean yield was over 1.0 Mg ha(-1)higher when soybean was cropped in succession compared with intercropping; however, the effects of the two forage grasses on soybean production were similar. Soil pH, calcium and magnesium content, cation exchange capacity, and base saturation were higher in the intercropping systems than in the succession systems, particularly when guinea grass was cultivated. Sowing guinea grass after maize harvest provided better forage quality, nutrient cycling, soybean yields, and soil chemical properties in tropical conditions."

Here we show that strip-intercropping enhances the spatial distributions of soil water across the 0-110 cm rooting zones, improves the coordination of soil water sharing during the co-growth period, and provides compensatory effect for available soil water. In a three-year (2009-2011) experiment, shorter-season pea (Pisum sativum L.) was sown in alternate strips with longer-season maize (Zea mays L.) without or with an artificially-inserted root barrier (a solid plastic sheet) between the strips. The intercropped pea used soil water mostly in the top 20-cm layers, whereas maize plants were able to absorb water from deeper-layers of the neighboring pea strips. After pea harvest, the intercropped maize obtained compensatory soil water from the pea strips. The pea-maize intercropping without the root barrier increased grain yield by 25% and enhanced water use efficiency by 24% compared with the intercropping with the root barrier. The improvement in crop yield and water use efficiency was partly attributable to the coordinated soil water sharing between the inter-strips and the compensatory effect from the early-maturing pea to the late-maturing maize.

It was used a complete block experimental design with split plots and three replicates. Periods of water deficit were placed in the plots and types of cultivation were placed in the subplots. Irrigation was stopped at germination and initial tillering of palisadegrass and at V4 and V15 stages of corn and returned when soil moisture was 40% of available water capacity. Tiller density and palisadegrass height were evaluated weekly. Dry matter (DM) of fractions of herbage mass as well as leaf area of the plants were evaluated at corn tasseling and when grains reached physiological maturity. Components of corn production were determined in the second sampling. In palisadegrass, water influenced only tillering, which was reduced in the plots in which water defict was forced at the moment of germination or at the beginning of tilering, in both cultivation systems. Plant height and DM production were affected only by cultivation, reducing when intercropped with corn. Evaluated production components did not influence corn grain productivity, which was similar in all treatments (average of 10,145 kg/ha). Palisadegrass plants produce more DM in single cultivation than intercropped with corn. Water deficit during germination and initial tillering reduces tillering of palisadegrass during establishment phase. Water deficit, applied in this trial, does not reduce DM yield in palisadegrass or corn.

However, soil N is also readily affected by land management practices, influencing N2O emissions. This study assessed N dynamics in soil from different crop systems including a 1:2 (one row of maize and two rows soybean) and 2:3 (two rows of maize and three rows of soybean) intercrop and a maize and soybean sole crop as a result of residue addition from maize or soybeans. This was achieved through a 140-day incubation study using delta N-15 natural abundance. The effect of residue addition on soil TN was greater than its influence on crop systems when compared to treatments with no residue addition (Cont). The influence of residue addition on intercrops was most readily observed in the fractionated soil. Light fraction N (LF-N) and soil microbial bio-mass N (SMB-N) were significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the intercrops than in the sole crops. Residue amended treatments were significantly (p < 0.05) depleted in delta N-15-TN, delta N-15-LF and delta N-15-SMB compared to Cont treatments. The delta N-15-SMB was significantly enriched (p < 0.05) compared to that of the residue, TN and LF-N. Residue amended treatments had significantly lower (p < 0.05) N2O emissions than Cont treatments. However, N2O emissions were not significantly different (p < 0.05) between soybean and maize amended treatments, nor between intercrops and sole crops. Our results demonstrate that the addition of contrasting residue types influenced short-term N dynamics in intercrops differently than sole crops. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It contributes significantly to the sustainability of traditional cropping systems because of the predominance of small-scale farmers who cultivate beans in those areas. The objectives of this work were to evaluate bush bean varieties under common agronomic cropping systems and to evaluate breeding lines under low N-fertility sole cropping and intercropping systems. The purpose of the study was to characterize the genotype and cropping system's variability in symbiotic and plant characters and to identify the most suitable genotypes to establish an effective symbiosis with indigenous strains of Rhizobium. No significant differences among the bush bean varieties evaluated under typical fertilization practices were observed for N-2-fixation and plant traits except for seed nitrogen. Significant differences among the bean lines studied under low N-fertilization conditions were detected for plant growth, plant component and N-2-fixation traits. A significant interaction of bean genotype x cropping system was found for number of nodules per plant and nodule moisture on the bush bean varieties studied, and for days to emergence, days to flowering, end of flowering, shoot length, root dry weight and shoot nitrogen on the bean lines evaluated. Nodulation parameters were correlated positively with the yield components, shoot and root parts and duration of flowering, and correlated negatively with seed crude protein, pod and seed dimensions and seed dry weight. These observations indicate that it may be possible to increase both the symbiotic N-2-fixation and seed yield through plant breeding.

Intercropping is useful for low-input/resource-limited agricultural systems. Iron (Fe) deficiency is a worldwide agricultural problem owing to the low solubility and bioavailability of Fe in alkaline and calcareous soils. Here, we summarize the effects of intercropping systems on Fe nutrition. Several cases showed that intercropping with graminaceous plants could be used to correct Fe nutrition of Leguminosae such as peanut and soybean or fruits such as Psidium guajava L., Citrus, grape and pear in calcareous soils. Intercropping systems have strong positive effects on the physicochemical and biochemical characteristics of soil and the microbial community due to interspecific differences and interactions in the rhizosphere. Rhizosphere interactions can increase the bioavailability of Fe with the help of phytosiderophores. Enriched microorganisms may also facilitate the Fe nutrition of crops. A peanut/maize intercropping system could help us understand the dynamics in rhizosphere and molecular mechanism. However, the role of microbiome in regulating Fe acquisition of root and the mechanisms underlying these phenomena in other intercropping system except peanut/maize need further work, which will help better utilize intercropping to increase the efficiency of Fe foraging.

Mapping Smallholder Yield Heterogeneity at Multiple Scales in Eastern Africa	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						"smallholder farms; yield; Africa; remote sensing; maize; agriculture"	"UNITED-STATES; MAIZE; TEMPERATURE; VEGETATION; NITROGEN; INDEX; LEAF"	Accurate measurements of crop production in smallholder farming systems are critical to the understanding of yield constraints and, thus, setting the appropriate agronomic investments and policies for improving food security and reducing poverty. Nevertheless, mapping the yields of smallholder farms is challenging because of factors such as small field sizes and heterogeneous landscapes. Recent advances in fine-resolution satellite sensors offer promise for monitoring and characterizing the production of smallholder farms. In this study, we investigated the utility of different sensors, including the commercial Skysat and RapidEye satellites and the publicly accessible Sentinel-2, for tracking smallholder maize yield variation throughout a similar to 40,000 km(2) western Kenya region. We tested the potential of two types of multiple regression models for predicting yield: (i) a calibrated model, which required ground-measured yield and weather data for calibration, and (ii) an uncalibrated model, which used a process-based crop model to generate daily vegetation index and end-of-season biomass and/or yield as pseudo training samples. Model performance was evaluated at the field, division, and district scales using a combination of farmer surveys and crop cuts across thousands of smallholder plots in western Kenya. Results show that the calibrated approach captured a significant fraction (R-2 between 0.3 and 0.6) of yield variations at aggregated administrative units (e.g., districts and divisions), while the uncalibrated approach performed only slightly worse. For both approaches, we found that predictions using the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI), which included the red edge band available in RapidEye and Sentinel-2, were superior to those made using other commonly used vegetation indices. We also found that multiple refinements to the crop simulation procedures led to improvements in the uncalibrated approach. We identified the prevalence of small field sizes, intercropping management, and cloudy satellite images as major challenges to improve the model performance. Overall, this study suggested that high-resolution satellite imagery can be used to map yields of smallholder farming systems, and the methodology presented in this study could serve as a good foundation for other smallholder farming systems in the world.

After clearing different subplots of the fallowed plots in 1993 and 1995, intercropping of cassava + maize was practiced with level (minimum) and mound tillage. Nitrogen fertilizer, between 0 and 60 kg ha(-1), was also applied to subplots of natural regrowth where planted fallows did not survive. Although a maize grain yield of 2.3 t ha(-1) and a cassava root yield of 18.3 t ha(-1) were obtained with level tillage in 1995, grain yield was increased to 2.6 t ha(-1) and cassava yields to about 22 t ha(-1) by mounding and 60 kg N ha(-1) application. Effects of mounding and N application were pronounced in the second and third consecutive years of cropping. Planted tree fallows like S. siamea, A. leptocarpa and L. leucocephala were highly suitable for soil rehabilitation. For sustainable crop production in the second consecutive year of cropping after a 6-year fallow period, mound tillage was recommended while in the third year, mound tillage with 60 kg N ha(-1) was recommended.

(Walp.)] genotypes was conducted at Nietvoorbij (33A degrees 54S, 18A degrees 14E), Stellenbosch, South Africa, to select cowpea material with superior growth and water-use efficiency (WUE). The results showed significantly higher photosynthetic rates, stomatal conductance and transpiration in leaves of plants at low density and in monoculture due to greater chlorophyll (Chl) levels relative to those at high density and in mixed culture. As a result, C concentration in leaves and the amount of C, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, and B accumulated in shoots at low density and under monoculture were also much higher. Even though no marked differences in photosynthetic rates were found between and among the five cowpea genotypes, leaf C concentration and shoot C, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, and B contents differed considerably, with Sanzie exhibiting the highest C concentration and C, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, and B contents in shoots, followed by Bensogla and Omondaw, while ITH98-46 and TVu1509 had the lowest shoot concentration and contents of C, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, and B. WUE (calculated as photosynthate produced per unit water molecule transpired) was significantly greater in plants at low density and monoculture relative to those at high density and in mixed culture. Isotopic analysis revealed significant differences in delta C-13 values of sorghum [Sorghum bicolor L. (Moench.)] and cowpea, with higher delta C-13 values being obtained for plants at low density and in monoculture relative to those at high density or in mixed culture. The five cowpea genotypes also showed significant differences in delta C-13 values, with Sanzie exhibiting the most negative value (i.e. low WUE) and ITH98-46, the least negative delta C-13 value (i.e. high WUE). Whether measured isotopically or from gas-exchange studies, sorghum (a C-4 species) exhibited much higher WUE relative to cowpea (a C-3 species). Both correlation and regression analyses revealed a positive relationship between WUE from gas-exchange studies and delta C-13 values from isotopic analysis of cowpea and sorghum shoots.	"[Dakora, F.

The plots consisted of four maize cultivars (BA 8512, BA 9012, EX 400 1, EX 6004) and the split-plots consisted of the following treatments: no-weeding; twice hand-weeding (20 and 40 days after sowing); and intercropping with cowpea ('Sempre Verde' cultivar), both maize and cowpea sown at the same time. The variables evaluated were: maize fresh green ears and grain yield; characteristics of internodes, leaves, tassels, ears, grains; plant height and ear insertion height: number of weed plants and species; fresh and dry biomass of weed species and cowpea. Ten weed species were outstanding during the experiment, many of them from the Poaceae family. No interactions were found between weed control method and maize cultivars for most variables evaluated; and plants from hand-weeded split-plots showed superior mean values compared to plants from non-weeded and intercropped split-plots, both not differing from each other. The cowpea was inefficient in controlling weed, reducing the maize yields and not producing any grain. The maize cultivars 'BA 8512' and 'BA 9012 showed the highest mean green ear yield, and the highest grain yield in hand-weeded, no-weeded and intercropped split-plots.

The aim of this study is to characterize the possible mechanisms in the stem of shade-induced promotion of seedling soybean lodging in intercropping systems at the proteome level. We found that the soybean stem became slender and prone to lodging when it was planted with maize in an intercropping system. The inhibition of lignin biosynthesis and lack of photosynthate (soluble sugar) for the biosynthesis of the cell wall led to the lower internode breaking strength. A total of 317 proteins were found to be affected in the soybean stem in response to shade. Under the shade stress, the down-expression of key enzymes involving the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway inhibited lignin biosynthesis. The up-regulation of expansin and XTHs protein expression relaxed the cell wall and promoted the elongation of internodes. Although the expression of the enzymes involving sucrose synthesis increased in the soybean stem, the lack of a carbon source prevented rapid stem growth. This metabolic deficit is the principal cause of the lower cellulose content in the stem of intercropped soybean, which leads to weakened stems and a propensity for lodging.

A sole crop of wheat planted at 120 kg seed ha(-1) was compared with sole crops of tori and of pea planted at 8 kg ha(-1) and 60 kg seed ha(-1), respectively, wheat + tori mixed-intercropped at 120:6, 120:4 and 120:2 kg seed ha(-1) and wheat + pea at 120:45, 120:30 and 120:15 kg seed ha(-1). Results over the two seasons showed that the intercropping of wheat + pea was profitable in terms of overall grain yield, land advantage, monetary advantage, economic return and meeting the dietary requirements of the subsistence farmers, although the sole crop of pea gave the highest net return. Mixing pea with wheat did not reduce wheat yields in either year except when pea was sown at 45 kg seed ha(-1), which reduced wheat yield significantly in the first season. For wheat + pea intercropping, sowing pea at 30-45 kg ha(-1) was the most profitable. The wheat + tori intercrop did not perform as well and was not as profitable as either sole crop. Intercropping of tori had a negative effect on wheat yield at all seed rates in the first year.

Silage fermentation profile, chemical composition and economic evaluation of millet and soya bean grown in monocultures and as intercrops	GRASS AND FORAGE SCIENCE			English	Article						"intercropping; millet; molasses; nutritive value; soya bean; silage"	"SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; ENERGY INPUTS; FORMIC-ACID; COVER-CROP; MOLASSES; FORAGE; QUALITY; ADDITIVES; INOCULANT; MOISTURE"	In recent years, dairy farmers in semi-arid regions have shifted from maize (Zea mays L.) as their primary source of feed to drought-tolerant crops, such as millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.), due to lack of water for irrigation. However, milletalone may not provide feed of sufficient quality and crude protein content for dairy cows. A field experiment was conducted in 2years to evaluate (i) whether intercropping millet with a relatively drought-tolerant soya bean cultivar (Glycine max Merr, cv. Williams) could improve silage quality with minimum yield penalty, and (ii) if the application of molasses could further enhance the nutritive value of silage of millet-soya bean intercrops. There were three intercropping ratios (60% millet with 40% soya bean, 50% millet with 50% soya bean, 40% millet with 60% soya bean) and monocultures of millet and soya bean. Mixed forages were treated with three levels of molasses: M-0 (without molasses), M-1, and M-2 (25 and 5% fresh matter respectively). Inclusion of soya bean in millet crops resulted in decreased silage yield compared with milletalone. The highest yield was obtained from the ratio of 60% millet with 40% soya bean. Molasses-treated silage had higher lactic acid, lower pH, and lower acid detergent fibre (ADF) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF). Silage produced from millet-soya bean intercrops exhibited enhanced fermentation, indicated by lower pH (364) and higher lactic acid (1663gkg(-1) DM) than silage from monocultures. Intercropping ratios had lower water-soluble carbohydrate, ADF and NDF than millet monoculture. Overall, an intercropping ratio of 60% millet with 40% soya bean was advantageous over other ratios in terms of higher yield, nutritive value and economic value.

Conservation agriculture (CA) is widely promoted across SSA but the impacts on key soil physical properties and functions such as soil structure and hydraulic properties that govern water storage and transmission are not well understood. The aim of this study was to assess the impacts of long term (10-12 years) maize-based CA on soil hydraulic conductivity, water retention and pore size distribution. Root zone (0-30 cm depth) soil total porosity, pore size distribution, saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) and plant available water capacity (PAWC) of conventional maize monocrop farming systems (CP) are compared with those of adjacent CA trials with either sole maize or maize intercrop/rotation with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L.) or velvet bean (Mucuna pruriens L.) in trial locations across central and southern Malawi. Results show that maize-based CA systems result in significant changes to soil hydraulic properties that correlate with improved soil structure. Results demonstrate increases of 5-15 % in total porosity, 0.06 - 0.22 cm/min in K-sat, 3-7 % in fine pores for water storage and 3-6 % in PAWC. Maize monocrop CA had similar effect on the hydraulic properties as the maize-legume associations. The values of K sat for CA systems were within optimum levels (0.03-0.3 cm/min) whereas PAWC was below optimum (< 20 %). There was no significant build-up in soil organic matter (OM) in the CA systems. The results lead to a recommendation that crop residue management should be more pro-actively pursued in CA guidance from agricultural extension staff to increase soil OM levels, increase yields and enhance climate resilience of sub-Saharan African farming systems.

However, studies about how biochar affects crop productivity so far have mainly focused on single cropping systems. Few have examined the effects of biochar additions on intercrops. We conducted a field experiment that investigated the effects of biochar amendments on yield and nutrient uptake in an intercropping system where maize (Zea mays L.) was intercropped with either soybean (Glycine max L) or peanut (Arachis hypogaea L). The relative advantages of both yield and total nutrient content were calculated as land equivalent ratios (LER). Biochar amendments significantly increased the yield advantage in both maize/soybean and maize/peanut systems over the single crops. Similarly, they significantly enhanced the relative N and P uptake advantage. Using the N-15 isotope dilution method, we examined the effect of biochar amendments on peanut N-2-fixation and subsequent N transfer from peanut to maize in a root-box experiment. Biochar amendments of 10 and 20 g kg(-1) soil increased peanut N fixation by 15.52% and 14.11%, and increased N transfer from peanut to maize by 32.66% and 36.07%, respectively. These results indicate that amending soil with biochar can amplify the benefits of legume-based intercropping by enhancing legume N fixation and facilitating N transfer from legume plants to co-existing cereal crops.

Building and evaluation of a dynamic model for assessing impact of smallholder endowments on food security in agricultural systems in highland areas of central America (SASHACA)	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						"Bean; Intercropping; Maize; Modelling, nutrition; Sustainable development"	"SIMULATION-MODELS; SENEGAL RIVER; CROP; MANAGEMENT; POVERTY; SOILS; KENYA"	Smallholder agricultural systems have an important role in world food production. Agricultural smallholders in highland areas of the Mesoamerican dry-corridor are central to improve farming systems. The key issue is that the subsistence smallholders are joint producer-consumers, with insufficient food production due to extreme environmental and weather conditions or incomes to supplement their own production from market sources. Modelling offers an approach for testing and improving knowledge about complex systems. The aim of this paper is to describe and assess a biophysical and socio-economic model of the smallholder agricultural systems based on maize-bean intercropping in highland areas of Central America. A Vensim (R) DSS system dynamics model was developed for assessing the impact of Smallholder endowments on food security and to identify critical points to achieve sustainable food security and poverty alleviation in Agricultural Systems in Highland Areas of Central America (SASHACA). The SASHACA model integrates scientific and practical knowledge of crop management, labour, soil water content, soil nitrogen, food consumption and economic components of the system. Model evaluation was conducted through a wide set of tests for assessment of dynamic models and statistical comparison of simulated versus observed data derived from surveys. The model simulates realistic outputs and presents logical behavioural representation. The maximum relative uncertainty of output variables ranged from 30% to 53% for univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses respectively. The model proved to be adequate for assessing food security under scenarios in low data availability areas. The SASHACA model could be adapted to simulate a wide range of smallholder agricultural systems in highland areas of Central America, and potentially in other locations.

Additionally, low use efficiency of P in agriculture due to its low immobility in soil and rapid precipitation with soil minerals, which caused low bioavailable P content in soil. Therefore, a sustainable P use and management mode for cleaner agricultural production is an urgent issue to solve. Here we evaluated an alternative strategy to facilitate plant P nutrient availability with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Rhizophagus irregularis) and their associated bacteria in cereal-legume intercropping based on a pot experiment. Plants were grown with or without Rhizophagus irregularis (AM) in pots against three different phosphorus levels and were inoculated with two bacteria strains (B). AMF root colonization and the influence of intercropping and microbial inoculation on plant growth and nutrient absorption were investigated. The findings showed that inoculated plants under the intercropping system produce the greatest plant growth responses and highest P uptake. The highest plant growth performance, soil P availability, and uptake were observed under the intercropping system with 30 kg P ha(-1) (50% of the regular recommended P fertilizer rate) application. Further, we evaluated the influence of the microbial inoculation on mobilization of sparingly soluble phosphate. The results demonstrated a significant decreased in Al-P, Fe-P and Ca-P under the 30 kg P ha(-1) fertilizer rate. Specifically, comparing with the control (Ctrl) there was 30.32% (AM) and 36.35% (AMB) reduction in Al-P, 44.53% (AM) and 45.11% (AMB) reduction in Fe-P, and 39.68% (AM) and 43.61% (AMB) decrease in Ca-P. These findings extend our knowledge regarding the significant role of plant-microbes symbiosis under intercropping system on sustainable crop production and nutrient (P) use efficiency.

Field experiments were conducted in the Polo Regional Extremo Oeste-APTA, in Andradina -Sao Paulo State, in 2005 and 2006. The objective was to evaluate the performance of green corn cultivars grown in single crop and intercropped with common bean. The randomized blocks design with 8 treatments constituted by the combination of two corn (CATIVERDE 02 and XB 7012) and three common bean cultivars of different growth habits: IPR Colibri (I), IPR Juriti (II) and IAC Carioca (III), with four repetitions was used. The influence of the intercropping on the performance of corn was not significant. The hybrid XB 7012 was more productive in intercropping and in single crop. The hybrid production more 8000 commercials ears and lengt ears when compared with the variety. The intercropping with the IPR Juriti or IPR Colibri cultivars were the most profitable for the producer.

Cowpea-cereal intercrop alone does not effectively manage the pest. Use of pesticides in intercrop leads to health and environmental risks. Fungal-based biopesticides offer a better option because they are environment- and consumer-friendly. This study assessed the combined effect ofMetarhizium anisopliaeICIPE 62 and cowpea-maize intercrop againstA. craccivoraunder six treatments: (1) untreated cowpea monocrop, (2) untreated cowpea-maize intercrop, (3) cowpea monocrop + ICIPE 62, (4) cowpea-maize intercrop + ICIPE 62, (5) cowpea monocrop + Duduthrin insecticide, and (6) cowpea-maize intercrop + Duduthrin during three seasons (long rainy/cold and dry/short rainy). In the cold and dry season, cowpea-maize intercrop treated with ICIPE 62 recorded the lowest infestation/cowpea damage, whereas the leaf yield was comparable to cowpea monocrop treated with ICIPE 62. In the short rainy season, the cowpea-maize intercrop treated with ICIPE 62 recorded the lowest infestation/damage, whereas leaf yield was similar to cowpea-maize intercrop treated with ICIPE 62 in the cold and dry season. Duduthrin in monocrop and intercrop did not reduce aphid infestation/cowpea damage levels in all the seasons. Although the efficacy ofM. anisopliaeICIPE 62-based biopesticide could be affected by seasons, it successfully controlled aphid population in cowpea-maize intercrop under field conditions without affecting aphid-associated natural enemies.

The focus of this review is to explore the potential of intercropping as a non-chemical weed management technique in IWM in selected tropical root and tuber crops namely, sweet potato, yam, and cocoyam. Fast-growing and short-duration crops are suggested to be intercropped with root and tuber crops cautiously to achieve high intercrop productivity in such systems. Yam-pumpkin intercrop has reduced weed growth by 70% and increased the yield of component crops by 30-50% whereas sweet potato-maize-cocoyam intercrop has reported a 50-90% of yield depression in component crops in the absence of weed control measures. This signifies the importance of selecting a spatially and temporally compatible intercrop combination for weed control and higher yields of component crops in an intercrop. Sweet potato-maize-soybean system, sweet potato-peanut system, yam-fluted pumpkin/melon-okra/maize system and sun hemp taro system have shown evidence to be compatible within each system and resulted in better weed control and higher crop yields. It is recommended to plant sweet potato at a density of 33,333 plants ha(-1) with peanut at a density of 66,667 plants ha-1 for the lowest weed density and the highest yield advantage whereas ideal density levels of selected intercrops are yet to be researched in most of the intercropping systems with root and tuber crops. A limited number of researches have been successfully conducted to find out compatibility levels of intercrops focusing on the degree of weed management and yield advantage of sweet potato-, yam-, and cocoyam-based intercrops. Hence, further research is mandatory prior to endorsing intercropping as an effective weed management technique in root and tuber crops. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	"[Weerarathne, L.

While several studies have shown that intercrop performance depends on the genotypes used, the available evidence has not been synthesized in an overarching analysis. Here, we review the effects of genotypes in cereal/legume intercropping systems, showing how genotype choice affects mixture performance. Furthermore, we discuss the mechanisms underlying the interactions between genotype and cropping system (i.e., sole cropping vs. intercropping). Data from 69 articles fulfilling inclusion criteria were analyzed, out of which 35 articles reported land equivalent ratio (LER), yielding 262 LER data points to be extracted. The mean and median LER were 1.26 and 1.24, respectively. The extracted genotype x cropping system interaction effects on yield were reported in 71% out of 69 publications. Out of this, genotype x cropping system interaction effects were significant in 75%, of the studies, whereas 25% reported non-significant interactions. The remaining studies did not report the effects of genotype x cropping system. Phenological and morphological traits, such as differences in days to maturity, plant height, or growth habit, explained variations in the performance of mixtures with different genotypes. However, the relevant genotype traits were not described sufficiently in most of the studies to allow for a detailed analysis. A tendency toward higher intercropping performance with short cereal genotypes was observed. The results show the importance of genotype selection for better in cereal/legume intercropping. This study highlights the hitherto unrevealed aspects of genotype evaluation for intercropping systems that need to be tackled. Future research on genotype effects in intercropping should consider phenology, root growth, and soil nutrient and water acquisition timing, as well as the effects of weeds and diseases, to improve our understanding of how genotype combination and breeding may help to optimize intercropping systems.

The experiment was performed under greenhouse conditions at Embrapa Agrobiologia, in Seropedica, RJ. The experimental design was completely randomized with three repetitions, in a 2x6 factorial arrangement, with two substrates (non sterile and sterile) derivative of a Fragiudult (Planosol) and six treatments of inoculation (Acaulospora morrowiae, Entrophospora Colombiana, Gigaspora margarita, Glomus clarum, Scutellospora heterogama, and a noninoculated control); besides a monoculture of each forage as a reference control. Three cuts were made during the experimental period, at different intervals, until the competition and substrate depletion made the permanence of the leguminous unviable in the consortium. Benefits were observed for AMF inoculation to the production of A. pintoi dry matter, being G. clarum the more efficient species. The use of seedlings efficiently colonized by AMF facilitates the establishment and initial growth of forage peanuts plants, increasing their competitive capacity with Brachiaria."

Cassava is dominated in combination with maize while it is the dominating species in combination with low-growing species. Combinations with maize or legumes show a real biological advantage over the sole crops reflected in (modified) Area x Time Equivalency ratio (ATER) values above unity. This is not the case with sweet potatoes. Success of maize+cassava mixtures depends on time and rate of recovery of cassava after maize harvest. Biological advantage tends to disappear when maize yield exceeds about 3.5 t ha-1. Undergrowing conditions or practices which result in high maize yield, intercropping cassava with maize is not biologically advantageous. Biological advantage of intercropping with legumes decreases with the legumes' growth duration, which should not exceed 90 days. Physiological traits of cassava for successful intercropping with maize or with legumes are probably not the same, but their nature is not clear. Moderate early vigour and a high partitioning of dry matter to the storage roots after harvest of the associated crops seem important in both cases. Cassava breeding for sole cropping has resulted in varieties with good performance in intercropping. Whether varieties can be selected with better adaptation to intercropping cannot be concluded from the literature. Dry-matter distribution, in particular after harvest of the associated crop, seems important but more growth analytical studies are required. Usefulness of currently available crop models in the study of intercropping is doubtful.

Insecticides are the first option that farmers choose to minimize the damage caused by the defoliators, and the result is not only the emergence of resistance to insecticides in the pests but also environmental pollution. A field experiment carried out at the University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad, India, in 2013 and 2014 in the kharif season (June to September) tested nine intercrops in soybean - all grown as rain-fed crops - for their ability to reduce the damage caused by defoliators to soybean leaves and the effect on grain yield of soybean. Of the three species of defoliators, namely Spodoptera litura, Hedylepta indicata, and Diachrysia orichalcea, S. litura was the most severe. Maize and pigeonpea proved the most effective intercrops because of their phenology, repellent chemicals, and physical barriers and also because they were not the natural hosts of the defoliators and did not compete with soybean. In these two crops, the incidence of the defoliators and the extent of damage to soybean leaves were the lowest and the yields were the highest (3.56 t ha(-1) in soybean-maize and 3.25 t ha(-1) in soybean-pigeonpea).

Growing two or more crops simultaneously is one of the mechanisms to reduce this problem. A field experiment was conducted in northwestern Ethiopia during 2017 and 2018 cropping seasons. Two legume crops [haricot bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and lupine (Lupinus angustifolius)] were intercropped with finger millet (Eleusine coracana) using two intercrop planting methods (row and mixture) and three finger millet-legume planting ratios (100.0%:75.0%, 100.0%:50.0% and 100.0%:25.0% of the respective recommended seed rate of sole crops). Two sole crop finger millets (planted in rows and broadcast) and two sole legume crops (haricot bean and lupine) were included as checks. The experiment comprised a randomized complete block design with three replications. Results indicated intercropped finger millet and total land output yield from finger millet-haricot bean row intercropping at a 100:50 planting ratio and sole finger millet planted in a row improved better yield stability. Finger millet-haricot bean row intercropping at a 100:50 planting ratio also resulted in higher grain yields of the component crops, area time equivalent ratio (1.34), relative production (38.1%) and economic (314.0%) efficiencies with a relatively lower component crop competitive ratio. Thus, this cropping system offered increased productivity and economic return and is a viable option for increasing household food security.

A split plot experimental design trial was set up to investigate the effects of 4 levels of nitrogen (N) fertilizer (0, 30, 60, and 120 kg N ha(-1)) on the growth of leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit in an intercrop with maize. Maize (Ekona 83TZ SR Y) was planted at 0, 25, 50, and 75 cm from Leucaena hedgerows planted on the same day. Leucaena plants were harvested at 3, 6, and 12 months after planting for biomass yield, N uptake, nodulation and mycorrhization. Results showed that at 0, 25, and 50 cm Leucaena/maize intercrop, there was no effect of N on Leucaena biomass. Leucaena biomass yield at 75-cm spacing compared favorably with the biomass of Leucaena sole cropped that had received 0, 30, and 60 kg N ha(-1). Application of 120 kg N ha(-1) to sole Leucaena increased biomass yield significantly above all the intercrop spacings. Measurement of the solar radiation in the system showed that there was a close relationship between the amount of solar radiation received by Leucaena and its biomass yield; Maize intercropped closer than 75 cm from Leucaena hedges reduced radiation received by Leucaena by 72% at 25 cm compared with 29% at 75 cm. This effect reduced Leucaena biomass yield at 25-cm spacing by 50%. This study showed that Leucaena can be established in intercrop with maize, but it requires about 75-cm intercrop spacing with crop and about 120 kg N ha(-1) for good establishment. Leucaena/maize intercrop at 75-cm spacing enables Leucaena to receive about 72% solar radiation and larger area to forage for plant nutrients."

To elucidate the mechanisms involved in nodule adaption to low P availability under legume/cereal intercropping systems, two experiments consisting of three cropping patterns (monocropped soybean, monocropped maize, soybean/maize intercropping) were studied under both sufficient- and deficient-P levels. Our results demonstrated that intercropped soybean with maize showed a higher nodulation and N-2 fixation efficiency under low P availability than monocropped soybean as evidenced by improvement in the number, dry weight and nitrogenase activity of nodules. These differences might be attributed to increase in P level in intercropping-induced nodules under low P supply, which was caused by the elevated activities of phytase and acid phosphatases in intercropping-induced nodules. Additionally, the enhanced expression of phytase gene in nodules supplied with deficient P level coincided with an increase in phytase and acid phosphatase activities. Our results revealed a mechanism for how intercropped maize stimulated nodulation and N-2 fixation of soybean under P deficient environments, where enhanced synthesis of phytase and acid phosphatases in intercropping-induced nodules, and stimulated nodulation and N-2 fixation.

Conservation Farming and Changing Climate: More Beneficial than Conventional Methods for Degraded Ugandan Soils	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						"land degradation; land management; conservation farming"	"STRIP INTERCROPPING SYSTEM; YIELD; WATER; CORN"	"The extent of land affected by degradation in Uganda ranges from 20% in relatively flat and vegetation-covered areas to 90% in the eastern and southwestern highlands. Land degradation has adversely affected smallholder agro-ecosystems including direct damage and loss of critical ecosystem services such as agricultural land/soil and biodiversity. This study evaluated the extent of bare grounds in Nakasongola, one of the districts in the Cattle Corridor of Uganda and the yield responses of maize (Zea mays) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) to different tillage methods in the district. Bare ground was determined by a supervised multi-band satellite image classification using the Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC). Field trials on maize and bean grain yield responses to tillage practices used a randomized complete block design with three replications, evaluating conventional farmer practice (CFP); permanent planting basins (PPB); and rip lines, with or without fertilizer in maize and bean rotations. Bare ground coverage in the Nakasongola District was 187 km(2) (11%) of the 1741 km(2) of arable land due to extreme cases of soil compaction. All practices, whether conventional or the newly introduced conservation farming practices in combination with fertilizer increased bean and maize grain yields, albeit with minimal statistical significance in some cases. The newly introduced conservation farming tillage practices increased the bean grain yield relative to conventional practices by 41% in PPBs and 43% in rip lines. In maize, the newly introduced conservation farming tillage practices increased the grain yield by 78% on average, relative to conventional practices. Apparently, conservation farming tillage methods proved beneficial relative to conventional methods on degraded soils, with the short-term benefit of increasing land productivity leading to better harvests and food security."

Productive efficiencies in corn, bean and squash (Cucurbita pepo L.) associations, intercropped with rows of fruit trees	PHYTON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY			Spanish	Article						"Land equivalent ratio (LER); Milpa system; Polycrops; Monoculture"	"CROPPING SYSTEMS; YIELD ADVANTAGE; MAIZE; RESILIENCE; CULTIVARS; STABILITY"	Mesoamerican agrosystem 'milpa' is the association of maize, beans (Phaseolus sp.) and squash (Cucurbits sp.) in the same space and time. It is characterized by the production of a large diversity of species in small areas, but currently its use tends to decrease because of technological introductions of monocultures. In this work, the yield and productive efficiency of the association maize, beans and squash, intercropped with fruit tree rows were evaluated in two locations from Puebla, Mexico, through 32 experimental treatments clustered in three agrosystems. They were: triple associations of maize-beans-squash intercropped with fruit trees, double associations maize-beans without fruit trees, and monocultures with and without intercropped fruit trees, all distributed under a randomized complete block design with three replications. Significant differences (P<0.05) were detected in the analysis of variance for locations of evaluation, agrosystems and experimental treatments based on associations and monocultures, for grain yields and land equivalent ratio. For the comparative index of area yield, there were just significant differences among agrosystems. In these cases, the agrosystems with triple and double associations differed significantly from the monocultures. These agroecosystems surpassed the yields per unit area by two or three times, and had greater productive efficiencies, in comparison to the monocultures. In relation with the performance of genotype-agrosystems, the triple interactions in alternate rows of 'Tropical' or 'Niebla'(R) maize, 'Negro' or 'Amarillo' beans and 'Huejotzingo' or 'Moxolahuac' squash, presented the highest yields (7.13 to 10.1 kg/8 m(2)) and productive efficiencies (>2.0). The intercropped row of fruit trees conferred a particular microenvironment, and complemented the agrosystem productivity. This was because the production of the fruit trees was significantly and positively associated (r>0.3) with the production of the most efficient and productive triple associations, both in San Andres Calpan with apple trees and in San Lorenzo Chiautzingo with peach trees.

Soil erosion on these lands is one of the most significant ecological restrictions to sustainable agriculture. A study was conducted during 2006-2008 to test the agronomic management practices for mitigating the adverse effects of soil erosion on arable soil. The experiment was designed in RCB with split plot arrangements. Cropping patterns, i e maize (Zea mays L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-maize (C1), maize-lentil (Lens culinaris Medic.)-maize (C2) and maize-wheat+lentil intercrop-maize (C3) were kept in main plots while fertilizer treatments; the control (T1), 50% NP also called farmers' practice (T2), 100% NPK or the recommended dose (T3) and 20 tonnes/ha farmyard manure integrated with 50% mineral N and 100% P and K (T4) were kept in sub-plots. Fertilizer treatments significantly improved soil physical properties in both depths. T4 showed the maximum improvement (13, 12, 22 and 31%) in bulk density, porosity, saturation and available water over the control and 3, 3, 8 and 7% over the T3 in surface soil. Cereal-legume rotation showed the maximum improvement while significant improvement in soil physical properties was noted with time, i e from kharif 2006 to rabi 2007. Highly significant negative correlation was observed between bulk density and saturation percentage (r(2)=0.97) and bulk density and AWHC (r(2)=0.93). It was concluded that NPK fertilizer alone cannot restore the physical environment of eroded soil to its maximum limit, but this objective could, rather, be achieved through mixed application of farmyard manure and mineral fertilizers. For this purpose, being an unstable nutrient element, recommended dose of mineral N must be reduced by 50% to avoid its over-application. In addition to other benefits of legumes in rotation, its improvement of physical properties further assert their importance in farming on such eroded lands."

Intercropping is a strategy for increasing agricultural productivity per unit land that is based on ecological mechanisms for improved resource capture. No quantitative synthesis has been made on the effect of intercrop system properties and species trait combinations on intercrop productivity. Here we use meta-analysis of the intercropping literature to study how the productivity of mixed systems is affected by intercrop system design and species traits. We focus on the effects of temporal niche differentiation between species, intercropping pattern, relative densities, the use of C3 and C4 species and the rate of nitrogen fertilizer. Land equivalent ratio (LER) is used as index for assessing the relative productivity of a mixed system as compared to sole crops. Average LER was 1.22 +/- 0.02, and no differences in LER were found between the 50 most highly cited studies and a random sample from the literature, indicating that high LERs in highly cited papers are representative of the entire literature. Temporal niche differentiation contributed substantially to high LER in systems combining a C3 and C4 species, but not in systems based on C3 species mixtures. The amount of N fertilizer interacted positively with the effect of temporal niche differentiation on LER. The intercropping literature is dominated by studies on cereal/legume mixtures. However, the few studies on C3 cereal/C4 cereal mixtures indicate these mixtures have high LER. Substantial improvements in land use efficiency in agriculture may be obtained by using mixtures, particularly C3/C4 mixtures. Thus, enhanced within-field crop diversity can make an important contribution to sustainable increases in food production. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the rhizospheric mechanisms driving trade-offs that occur along phosphorus (P) and water availability gradients have not yet been systematically clarified. We established three types of root isolation conditions (no barrier, nylon barrier and solid barrier) at different P and water addition levels to address the above issue in a maize-grass pea intercropping system. Results The total yield and biomass net effect (NE) and the relative interaction index (RII) were significantly higher than 0 under all environmental conditions, demonstrating that plant-plant interactions generated positive effects in the intercropping system. The maize yield and biomass RII were 0.029-0.095 and 0.018-0.066, respectively, which indicated that maize growth was constantly facilitated. However, the RII for grass pea yield and biomass exhibited a different trend in comparison with maize. It was higher than 0 (as the facilitated species) under low soil P and moisture conditions and transitioned to values lower than 0 (facilitator species) under high P and moisture conditions, which showed that the type and intensity of plant-plant interactions steadily shifted with the applied stressors. Direct interactions decreased the maize rhizospheric soil pH by 1.5% and 1.9% under Low-P conditions. Notably, the rhizospheric soil acid and alkaline phosphatase secretions of maize and grass pea increased by 17.4-27.4% and 15.3-27.7%, respectively, in P-deficient soils. These results show that plant-plant interactions can effectively relieve P stress by mineralizing organophosphorus in P-deficient soils. Furthermore, the above tendency became more pronounced under drought-stressed conditions. The nylon barrier partially restricted the exchange and utilization of available nutrients and decreased the total yield and biomass by 1.8-7.8% and 1.1-7.8%, respectively. The presence of a solid barrier completely restricted interspecific rhizospheric interactions and decreased the total yield and biomass by 2.1-13.8% and 1.6-15.7%, respectively. Phytate and KH2PO4 addition intensified asymmetric interspecific competition, and grass pea was consistently subjected to competitive pressures. Conclusion Briefly, the tradeoff between facilitation and competition was driven by rhizospheric interactions, and the transition in the intensity and type of interaction was highly dependent on resource availability in a biologically diverse system.

Estimating demand for perennial pigeon pea in Malawi using choice experiments	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						"Pigeon pea; Malawi; Perennial; Choice experiment; Farmer preferences; Soil fertility"	"WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; FARMER PREFERENCES; FOOD SECURITY; SMALLHOLDER; DIVERSITY; SYSTEMS; CROPS; WHEAT; SOIL; VALUATION"	Perennial crops have numerous ecological and agronomic advantages over their annual counterparts. We estimate discrete choice models to evaluate farmers' preferences for perennial attributes of pigeon pea intercropped with maize in central and southern Malawi. Pigeon pea is a nitrogen-fixing leguminous crop, which has the potential to ameliorate soil fertility problems related to continuous maize cultivation, which are common in Southern Africa. Adoption of annual pigeon pea is relatively low but perennial production of pigeon pea may be more appealing to farmers due to some of the ancillary benefits associated with perenniality. We model perennial production of pigeon pea as a function of the attributes that differ between annual and perennial production: lower labor and seed requirements resulting from a single planting with multiple harvests, enhanced soil fertility and higher levels of biomass production. The primary tradeoff associated with perennial pigeon pea intercropped with maize is competition with maize in subsequent years of production. While maize yield is approximately twice as valuable to farmers as pigeon pea yield, we find positive yet heterogeneous demand for perenniality driven by soil fertility improvements and pigeon pea grain yield.

A fixed plot field experiment was conducted with three cropping patterns (maize monocropping, potato monocropping, and maize-potato intercropping) under four (nitrogen) N levels in Kunming, China during 2014-2017. Based on crop N uptake and soil nitrate transformation, the underlying mechanism of potential nitrate-N (NO3--N) leaching (NO3--N accumulation below the root layer) and N regulation was explored under intercropping and monocropping. The results showed that the area-scaled potential NO3--N leaching under intercropping was mitigated by 3.4-37.4%, with a mean of 15.8% relative to the weighted mean of maize- and potato-monocropping. Intercropping-related mitigation of potential NO3--N leaching was enhanced with increasing N level. Intercropping increased the ammonia-oxidizing archaea population and soil nitrification potential but had no significant impact on the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and narG. Redundancy analysis and structural equation modeling indicated that soil water played a crucial role in regulating the intercropping-related mitigation of potential NO3--N leaching, while the improvement in N uptake by intercropped maize reduced the potential NO3--N leaching at low and medium N levels. The results highlight the intercropping advantage over monocropping in mitigating the risk of NO3--N leaching.

Influence of poultry manure and NPK fertilizer on yield and yield components of crops under different cropping systems in south west Nigeria	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						"poultry manure; NPK; cropping system; intercrop"	"GROWTH; MAIZE"	"Field experiments were conducted in two villages (Oniyo and Moloko Ashipa) representing two agro ecologies in the south west area of Nigeria during 2000 and 2001 cropping seasons. The objective was to determine the effects of NPK fertilizer and poultry manure on the yield and yield components in cassava/maize/melon systems. The factors were (1) cropping systems: cassava/maize/melon, sole cassava, sole maize and sole melon; and (2) fertilizers: no fertilizer, NPK 15-15-15 (400 kg/ha), poultry manure (5 t/ha), 2.5 t/ha poultry manure +200 kg/ha NPK 15-15-15 and mineral fertilizer (NPK 15-15-15). Intercropping had no significant effect on cassava root yield but it reduced maize and melon seed yield compared to sole cropping. Land equivalent ratio (LER) values were however higher under intercropping than sole cropping. Crop yields were statistically the same under NPK alone and NPK + poultry manure but significantly higher than both poultry manure alone and control in both locations."

Forage legumes for soil productivity enhancement and quality fodder production	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"Fodder legumes; soil productivity enhancement; crop/livestock interaction; enhancement of farmer income and living standard; soil fertility restoration and conservation."	SYSTEMS	Ruminant performance in the tropics, as in the Northern Guinea Savanna of Nigeria, is affected by seasonal variation in the availability and quality of pasture, and supplementation of animal feeds in these systems is constrained by the high price of imported inputs. Also, for farming systems in the subhumid zone of West Africa, nitrogen is generally the most limiting nutrient for crop production, and this problem has been compounded in recent decades by the difficulties faced by farmers in obtaining N fertilizers. The integration of forage legumes into the cropping cycles in the NGS of Nigeria could have the potential to enhance yields of subsequent crops through the increase in plant available N and organic carbon in the soil, as well as quality fodder for feeding livestock in the zone. Following the investigation of this, results obtained show that that Macrotyloma uniflorum and Centrosema pascuorum treatments resulted in lower bulk density than the other legume treatments for the two years. Also following one year cropping, Aeschynomena histrix/maize intercrop showed 64% increase in soil organic carbon, and was followed by Stylosanthes hamata/maize (30%), and sole A. histrix (20 %). Planting of Lablab (black seed), intercrop of Chaemacrista rotundifolia, M. uniflorum, Lablab and A. histrix with maize could result in over 100% soil N improvement within one year. The intercrop of M. uniflorum with maize resulted in higher maize grain yield than the sole maize, over the period 2000 to 2002. As much as 2.50 t ha(-1) of maize stover could be obtained after planting forage legumes/maize for two years and this could be mixed with as much as 15 t ha(-1) of legume residues to produce quality fodder for supplemental feeding of livestock especially in the dry seasons when livestock feed is scarce. Both maize and legume grains, and quality fodder could be sold for cash returns to the farmer, thus improving the farmers' income from farming.	"[Odunze, A. C.; Bawa, G.

In Texas, glyphosate at 0.77 kg a.e./ha in combination with azoxystrobin, tebuconazole, pyraclostrobin, and tetraconazole applied at the V3 or RI soybean growth stage controlled Amaranthus palmeri and Panicum texanum at least 97% control while glyphosate alone controlled both weeds 100%. In Georgia, glyphosate applied alone to a mixed stand of annual grasses [P. texanum L., Digitaria ciliaris (Retz.) Koel., and Dactyloctenium aegyptium (L.) Willd.] at the V3 stage of soybean development provided only 68% control and at the RI stage provided 94% control. When rated approximately four weeks after treatment application, increased control of the mixed stand of annual grasses was obtained with glyphosate Plus azoxystrobin or pyraclostrobin applied at the R1 stage rather than the V3 growth stage. No yield results Were obtained at the Georgia location: however, at the Texas location, soybean yields were higher when glyphosate plus azoxystrobin or tetraconazole was applied at V3 compared with the RI stage. In conclusion, tank mixing of glyphosate with a fungicide is a good option and can be used to reduce production costs. If glyphosate applications are delayed too long, yield reductions can occur due to early season weed competition. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	"[Grichar, W.

Effective reduction of mycotoxins in grain is crucial in order to improve food and feed safety. To reduce Fusarium mycotoxins in high-risk maize-wheat rotations under reduced or no tillage practices, we investigated three innovative cropping systems: (i) cut-and-carry biofumigation, (ii) maize intercropping and (iii) cover cropping. We demonstrated that the use of white mustard and Indian mustard as cut-and-carry biofumigant crops, intercrops with grain maize and interval cover crops after silage maize substantially reduced mycotoxins (32-76 %) in subsequent wheat. Berseem clover as a cut-and-carry biofumigant crop and winter pea as an interval cover crop also greatly decreased mycotoxins (53-87 %) in wheat. Cut-and-carry biofumigation and cover crops improved the yield of winter wheat by up to 15 % and spring wheat by up to 25 %, respectively. Based on these findings, we provide a synthesis of alternative cropping systems that effectively reduce Fusarium mycotoxins in wheat, thus improving food and feed safety. Nevertheless, the proposed cropping systems may increase production costs, and thus, any economic trade-offs should be further assessed to weigh potential conflicts between food/feed safety goals and economic viability.

With some 95% of the Province classed as mountainous and the valleys and plains already fully utilised for agriculture, industry and urban growth, pressure on remaining land resources is high. Cultivation has steadily encroached onto increasingly steep and marginal land, which further accelerates erosion rates. Little published work is available of soil erosion rates or potential soil conservation measures in Yunnan. A collaborative research programme was initiated between Yunnan Agricultural University (YAU) and The University of Wolverhampton to study several potential soil conservation measures. Thirty runoff plots on the experimental farm of YAU were used to investigate the effectiveness of five treatments: conventional tillage (control), no-tillage, straw mulch, polythene mulch and intercropping. Plots were cropped with maize (Zea mays) sown either along the contour or downslope, on 3, 10 and 27 slopes. Data on erosion rates and crop productivity were collected during four growing seasons (May-October), 1993-1996 inclusive. Seasonal rainfall totals were 576.3, 768.3, 876.3 and 619.7 mm in 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively. Respective seasonal mean erosion rates equalled 0.73, 4.00, 7.56 and 0.05 tha(-1). Straw mulch was very effective in decreasing erosion rates. In 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996, soil loss was 18, 66, 86 and 78% less than the conventionally tilled plots, respectively. Straw mulch maintained topsoil structure and encouraged infiltration, thus decreasing runoff and erosion rates. Conversely, erosion rates under conventional tillage were high. Erosion rates from the polythene mulch plots were similar to conventional tillage, as infiltration was effectively decreased, thereby concentrating runoff and channelling it towards exposed, inter-mulch areas. However, maize development and grain yields were consistently higher under the polythene mulch than the other treatments. Mean contour cultivation erosion rates were 31% less than downslope planting rates. The collaborative research on soil conservation is continuing, with a catchment-based research programme underway in Wang Jia catchment in Kedu Township, in northeast Yunnan. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

An intercropping system combining wheat and grain legumes may help maintain SOC, soil mineral N and WUE while also providing an opportunity to sequester carbon (C) in low input organic systems. We grew wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. 'Scarlet') as a monoculture and intercropped with either common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris cv. 'Red Kidney', or cv. 'Black Turtle'), or fava bean (Vicia faba cv. 'Bell') in rows of 1:1, 2 wheat: 1 bean or broadcast arrangement without fertilizers for 2 years to assess the effects of genotype and spatial arrangement on biological nitrogen fixation and seasonal transfer, WUE, gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP), and net ecosystem productivity (NEP). Stable isotope methods (C-13 and N-15 natural abundance) were used to quantify C and N within the plant and soil system. Field CO2 exchange measurements used a dynamic closed transparent chamber connected to a portable CO2 analyzer. Intercropped plots had higher percent N derived from symbiotic N-2 fixation, and increased C and N accumulation compared to monocultured wheat. The fava bean cv. Bell intercrops showed increased nodulation (60-80 % more nodules) and percent N derived from symbiotic N-2 fixation (10-12 % higher) compared to common beans resulting in the fixation of 74 kg N ha(-1) biologically from the 1:1 arrangement. The highest rate of N-transfer (13 %) was observed in the wheat-fava bean cv. Bell combination when planted in the 1:1 arrangement. All intercrops accumulated more N in shoot biomass compared to monoculture wheat with wheat-fava bean cv. Bell (1:1 arrangement) accumulating the highest N (34 kg N ha(-1), i.e., 176 % higher) and C (214 g C m(-2) year(-1), i.e., 26 % higher). All plots fixed the most CO2 (i.e., greatest GEP) during mid-growth stage (50 days after seeding i.e., prior to flowering) however, wheat-fava bean cv. Bell in the 1:1 arrangement displayed the greatest NEP sequestering C at the seasonal daytime average rate of 208 mg C m(-2) h(-1) (i.e., 7 % higher than wheat monoculture plots). Intrinsic WUE of wheat, as indicated by delta C-13, was also improved when grown with fava bean cv. Bell or common bean cv. Red Kidney. This study demonstrated that intercropping wheat and fava bean is an effective strategy to achieve greater nitrogen fixation and transfer to the wheat counterparts, higher WUE, and ecosystem productivity than wheat monocultures in areas with low soil N and C. Furthermore, the wheat-fava bean cv. Bell (1:1 arrangement) was more productive than either the 2:1 or mixed planting arrangements.

The rice was seeded in 75 cm spaced 4-row strips (15/75 cm) while the intercrops as forage were seeded on the vacant spaces between the rice strips. The results revealed that rice grain yield decreased to a significant level by forage intercrops compared to monocropped rice which varied from 10.94 to 25.87%, with the maximum (25.87%) by sesbania followed by pigeonpea (16.67) against the minimum (10.94%) by maize intercrop. In terms of total rice grain yield equivalent (TRGYE), the highest TRGYE (6.45 ton ha(-1)) was recorded for rice + forage maize intercropping system followed by rice + cowpea (5.08 ton ha(-1)) and rice + sesbania (4.92 ton ha(-1)) against the minimum (4.02 ton ha(-1)) for monocropped rice clearly indicating yield advantages of intercropping over monocropping of rice. Similarly the net field benefits obtained from different intercropping systems were considerably higher than the sole cropping of rice. The maximum net benefit of Rs.42325 ha(-1) was recorded for rice + maize which is 37.32% more than sole rice followed by rice + cowpea (Rs.30885 ha(-1)) which is 14.03% higher than monocropping of rice (Rs.26526 ha(-1)). The results also revealed that residual soil nitrogen and organic matter was improved in all the intercropping systems except rice + maize intercropping system. However, the maximum increase in soil nitrogen (7.14%) was recorded for rice + sesbania intercropping system while the residual soil phosphorus and potassium were depleted in all the intercropping systems as compared to initial soil analysis.

Vetch and barley were the CCs with the highest N2O and CO2 losses (75 and 47% increase compared with the control, respectively) in the fallow period. In all cases, fluxes of N2O were increased through N fertilization and the incorporation of barley and rape residues (40 and 17% increase, respectively). The combination of a high C:N ratio with the addition of an external source of mineral N increased the fluxes of N2O compared with -Ba and -Rp. The direct emissions of N2O were lower than expected for a fertilized crop (0.10% emission factor, EF) compared with other studies and the IPCC EF. These results are believed to be associated with a decreased NO pool due to highly denitrifying conditions and increased drainage. The fluxes of CO2 were in the range of other fertilized crops (i.e., 1118.71-1736.52 kg CO2-C ha(-1)). The incorporation of CC residues enhanced soil respiration in the range of 21-28% for barley and rape although no significant differences between treatments were detected. Negative CH4 fluxes were measured and displayed an overall sink effect for all incorporated CC (mean values of -0.12 and -0.10 kg CH4-C ha(-1) for plots with and without incorporated CCs, respectively).

The study involved growing seven genotypes of the above legumes with maize in alternate rows in two separate experiments. A sole crop of maize was used as the reference crop to determine N2 fixation by the N-15 methodology. Significant genotypic differences in pod yield and stover N content were observed in intercropped mungbean and groundnut. The percentage N derived from the atmosphere showed a genotypic variation of 31 to 45% (7 to 10 kg N2 fixed ha-1) in mungbean and 47 to 69% (9 to 18 kg N2 fixed ha-1) in groundnut. Harvest index for N varied from 58 to 77% in mungbean and 55 to 75% in groundnut. In groundnut, the uptake of soil N was significantly affected by the genotype. Assuming that the N contribution to the soil by the below-ground plant parts was negligible, the removal of seeds at maturity resulted in a negative N balance in the soil in all the genotypes of mungbean. In groundnut, some genotypes produced a positive N balance in the soil. Owing to high N2 fixation capacity and low harvest index for N, groundnut showed a greater N supplementing ability than mungbean.

An intercropping experiment with oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq), soybean (Glycine max), maize (Zea mays) and cocoyam (Xanthosoma sagittifolium) was therefore conducted from 1992-1994 to evaluate changes in soil nutrient levels. The experimental design was a randomised complete block with three replicates. Treatments consisted of: (A) sole oil palm; (B) sole soybean; (C) sole maize; (D) sole cocoyam; (E) oil palm + soybean; (F) oil palm + maize; (G) oil palm + cocoyam; (H) oil palm + soybean + maize; (I) oil palm + soybean + cocoyam; (J) oil plam + soybean + maize + cocoyam. A pre-cropping composite soil sample was taken at a depth of 0-30 cm in 1992. Soil sampling for analysis was conducted on plot basis after harvesting for soil pH, organic matter, total nitrogen, available P and exchangeable K, Mg and Ca. There was no significant change in pH after 3 cropping years, but soil organic matter declined from 10-51% in treatments G and I. The decline in total N ranged from 50-70% in treatments A and J. At the end of the experiment the P level increased up to 71% in treatment E. Exchangeable K declined from 32 to 62% in treatment F and H, respectively. The observed decline in N and K could be due to crop removal and leaching. No significant changes were observed for Ca and Mg. Intercropping depressed the sex ratio in oil palm by between 6 and 17%. Soybean seed yield was highest (1.5 t ha(-1)) in the sole plot and lowest (0.7 t ha(-1)) in soybean + oil palm t maize t cocoyam. Grain yields from sole maize and maize intercropped with oil palm were superior to yields from the other intercropping treatments. A similar trend was observed for cocoyam corm yield. The significance of this finding for sustainable agriculture is that intercropping encourages the maximization of land use, stability in yield and profit. Furthermore, intercropping of cereal with grains provides balanced energy and protein diets for farm families."

Simulation of intercropped plants with integrated soil-plant-atmosphere models is a challenging procedure due to the requirement of a second spatial dimension for calculating the soil water lateral flux. Evaluations of more straightforward approaches for intercrop modeling are, therefore, mandatory. An adaptation of the 1D model Soil, Water, Atmosphere and Plant coupled to the World Food Studies (SWAP/WOFOST) to simulate intercropping (SWAP 2x1D) based on solar radiation and water partitioning between plant strips was developed and the outcomes are presented. An application of SWAP 2x1D to maize-soybean (MS) strip intercropping was evaluated against the monocropping maize (M) and soybean (S) simulated with the 1D model SWAP/WOFOST, and a sensitivity analysis of SWAP 2x1D was carried out for the intercropping MS. SWAP 2x1D was able to simulate the radiation interception by both crops in the intercropping MS and also to determine the effect of the radiation attenuation by maize on soybean plants. Intercropped plants presented higher transpiration and resulted in lower soil evaporation when compared to their equivalent monocropping cultivation. A numerical issue involving model instability caused by the simulated lateral water flux in the soil from one strip to the other was solved. The most sensitive plant parameters were those related to the taller plant strips in the intercropping, and soil retention curve parameters were overall all significantly sensitive for the water balance simulation. This implementation of the SWAP model presents an opportunity to simulate strip intercropping with a limited number of parameters, including the partitioning of radiation by a well-validated radiation sharing model and of soil water by simulating the lateral soil water fluxes between strips in the 2x1D environment.

Influence of the spatial distribution of maize and Brachiaria brizantha intercropping on the weed population under no-tillage	PLANTA DANINHA			Portuguese	Article						"spatial distribution; corn-grass intercropping; dry matter productivity; straw"		Intercropping corn with tropical forages under no-tillage can decrease weed incidence as a result of high phytomass production and allelopathy provided by the superficial deposition of straw in the soil. This work aimed to evaluate the influence of intercropping modalities of corn with Brachiaria brizantha in two sowing spacings under no-tillage system on the weed population. The experiment was carried out under field conditions in 2002-2003 and 2003-2004, at the College of Agricultural Science/UNESP in Botucatu-SP-Brazil. The experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design in a 2x4 factorial scheme with four replications. The treatments consisted of two spacings between the corn rows (E1 -0.45m and E2-0.90m) and four tillage modalities (MCS-single corn tillage. MBL-corn tillage with B. brizantha in the sowing row, MBE-corn tillage with B. brizantha in the spacing between two rows and MBLE-corn tillage with B. brizantha simultaneously in the row and interrow). Forage dry matter production. phyto-sociological characterization, and weed incidence and control were evaluated. Corn tillage with B.brizantha simultaneously in the row and interrow at 0.90m spacing provided highest straw production. In addition. the presence of B.brizantha in the intercropping decreased weed density. Corti intercropping with B. brizantha provided 95% weed control regardless of type of sowing.

The land equivalent ratio (LER) values (on an average of 1.20 and 1.07 for maize chickpea and maize soybean, respectively; and from 0.85 to 1.08 on average for maize wheat after P fertilization) indicated that the interspecific stimulation of P uptake may be a general phenomenon i.e. controlled by soil P availability rather than crop species or soil type. Rhizosphere soil pH increased compared to that of non-rhizosphere even following the addition of the acidic calcium superphosphate (on an average of 0.16-0.56 pH units), suggesting rhizosphere acidification due to intercropping could not be the cause of increased P uptake in acid soils, unlike in alkaline or calcareous soils. The microbial phospholipids fatty acid (PLFA) profiles varied with both intercropping species and soil P status, indicating a selective enrichment of competent species (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, gram-negative bacteria, actinomycetes, and probably P solubilizing microorganisms) that may be responsible for increased P uptake during intercropping. The results suggest that root contact modified the microbial communities and the dominant microbial species in the intercropped rhizosphere, thereby contributing to increased P uptake during intercropping in acidic soils.

The experiment was carried out in an experimental area and consisted of the evaluation of nine cover treatments and soil management in a randomized complete block design. The treatments were: NT fallow, CT fallow, Crotalaria spectabilis, Crotalaria breviflora, maize + Crotalaria spectabilis, Pennisetum glaucum, Urochloa ruziziensis, Cajanus cajan, sunflower+ Urochloa ruziziensis, Stylosanthes, Vigna unguiculata, Urochloa brizantha, maize + Urochloa ruziziensis. The evaluations were carried out before the desiccation for soybean sowing in the crops (10/23/2014) and (09/21/2015), before the post-emergence of soybean (09/12/2014) and (12/11/2015) and in the second season (12/06/2015). The useful area was 5 x 5 m and all weeds were counted and identified, but only the four species with the largest population were collected. The weeds evaluated were: Digitaria horizontalis, Digitaria insularis, Porophyllum ruderale and Tridax procumbens. Fallow treatments presented higher weed populations in relation to the others, in all periods of evaluation. Digitaria horizontalis presented the highest phytomass production in most seasons. The production systems with Urochloa ruziziensis, Pennisetum glaucum, Crotalaria spectabilis and intercropped with maize + Urochloa ruziziensis, sunflower + Urochloa ruziziensis and maize + Crotalaria spectabilis were the best alternatives for integrated weed management. reducing the incidence and increasing control of the main species that were detected during the conduction of the experiment.

Sites were selected according to their representativeness regarding soils and climate in agro-ecological units. The fertilizer trial programme included all major food crops typical for the respective area, both monocropped and intercropped in the case of cereals. Economic optimum fertilizer rates were calculated taking into account input/output price ratios and value-cost ratios. The majority of sites showed responses to N or P, only at one site response to both N and P with a significant interaction was found. Price elasticity of crops such as potatoes and cabbages was higher than that of maize or sorghum. Critical soil P levels were determined for maize at 13 ppm P for modified Olsen extract and 32 ppm P for Mehlich I extract. Variability of rainfall was found to greatly influence viability of fertilizer recommendations. First attempts to extrapolate fertilizer recommendations from areas of representativeness to areas with similar conditions by means of GIS and modelling approaches are discussed.

However, as the level of productivity increases due to technological improvements whether intercropping compared to sole cropping remains the most productive and resource efficient cropping system is not well understood. Here we hypothesize that inter-crops outperform sole crops at low levels of resource availability because of improved resource capture and resource use efficiency; and answered whether this advantage decreases with increasing levels of resource availability. The performance of three cropping systems i.e. maize intercropped with navy bean, sole maize and sole navy bean were evaluated at three levels of resource input i.e. a low water/nitrogen (low W/N), a medium water/nitrogen (medium WIN), and a high water/nitrogen (high W/N), in three independent experiments, conducted over two consecutive years. The performance of the cropping systems was evaluated in terms of land equivalent ratios (LER), total grain yield, protein and energy productions as well as resource (water, nitrogen, and solar radiation) capture and use efficiency. Our results indicate that maize productivity (grain yield, protein and energy productions) was not significantly affected by the intercrop at any level of resource availability. However, irrespective of the level of resource input, intercropping significantly reduced the productivity of navy bean. The advantage of the intercropping, in terms of LER, tended to decrease with increasing the level of water and nitrogen supply i.e. decreased from 28% to 6% for above ground biomass, from 40% to 7% for grain yield, from 41% to 0.3% for protein production and from 40% to 9.2% for energy production. Intercropping was therefore more efficient in terms of LER under low W/N than under high W/N conditions. The LER was directly related to improved capture of nitrogen and to higher water use efficiency. Here we conclude that in terms of LER, intercropping systems are more resource efficient and suitable for lower productivity environments. As more productive technologies are adopted by smallholder farmers, agricultural development projects and extension services need to consider under what conditions sole cropping become a more productive system.

J	Abebe, H				Abebe, Hunegnaw			A survey to assess the value of the legume chimero (Bouffordia dichotoma syn. Desmodium dichotomum) in mixed farming systems in North and South Wollo Zones, Amhara Region, Ethiopia	TROPICAL GRASSLANDS-FORRAJES TROPICALES			English	Article						"Community use; dry matter yield; nutritive value; tropical legumes"		This study was conducted to determine the yields and chemical composition of the legume, chimero (Bouffordia dichotoma syn. Desmodium dichotomum), at its niche in North and South Wollo Zones, Amhara Region, Ethiopia and how it is used by farmers in the region. Dry matter yields of chimero growing as spontaneous intercrop with sorghum in 3 Peasant Associations in each of the 5 sampled districts were determined as was the chemical composition of the forage, based on pooled samples. The average yield of chimero growing as a self-sown legume with sorghum was 4,400 kg DM/ha. Mean chemical composition was 15.4% ash, 22% CP, 31% NDF, 26% ADF and 5.8% ADL, while IVDMD was 61%. Mineral concentrations were: 0.6% Ca, 0.23% P, 1.5% K, 0.78% Mg, 0.01% Na, 0.27% S, 0.16% Fe, 4.4 mg/kg Cu, 45 mg/kg Mn and 12.3 mg/kg Zn. Chimero appears useful as a supplement for feeding to ruminant animals, provided no anti-nutritional factors are present. A self-sown legume that can produce at least 4 t DM/ha with 22% CP when growing with a sorghum crop seems worthy of further investigation. Further studies are needed to assess the impacts on grain and stover yields when chimero is sown with grain crops of sorghum and maize, as well as effects on soil N. The role of this legume in association with grasses warrants investigation. Multi-site evaluation of a range of ecotypes could identify more productive lines.

The experiment was as split plots based on randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. Planting method had three levels (row intercropping, mixed intercropping and intercropping on row) as the main factors. Planting proportions had four levels (sole-cropping of barley and vetch, 2 to I barley-vetch and 1 to 2 barley-vetch proportions) as the sub-factors. In order to make the mixtures, the replacement series technique was used. The results indicated that there were significant differences among planting methods, planting proportions and their interactions for dry forage yield. The highest-dry forage yield was obtained for 1 to 2 barley-vetch proportion in intercropping on row (18.35 t/ha), while the lowest yield was observed in sole cropping of vetch in row intercropping (7.73 t/ha). Calculated land equivalent ratio (LER) for dry forage yield indicated that 1 to 2 barley-vetch proportion in intercropping on row had highest LER equal to 1.63. Thus, proportion of 1 to 2 barley to vetch in intercropping on row showed its advantages in obtaining higher forage yield and better exploitation of sources, compared to other treatments. Interactions of planting method and planting proportions for crude protein (CP) and crude fiber (CF) were significantly different. Crude fiber percentage decreased, while crude protein percentage increased with decrease in barley proportion. Thus, barley and vetch intercropping showed its advantage as forage quality in comparison to sole cropping of barley.

The aim of the present study was to explore the effects of two pea cultivars (Zero4 and Nitouche) intercropped with triticale, with or without wheat (Triticum aestivum) residues incorporation, on soil C and N dynamics, on bacterial community structure and their link swith N2O emissions. Monocrops and bare soil (no plant) treatments were used as an additional control in order to account for the level of mineralisation between treatments. Changes in total C and N contents and in some functionally-related soil pools (microbial biomass C and N, basal respiration, KCl-exchangeable ammonium and nitrate, potentially mineralisable N, DOC, ecophysiological indexes) were followed throughout a 97-day microcosm experiment carried out on a loamy arable soil. ARISA community fingerprinting of soil extracted DNA and GHG emissions were carried out at two key stages (pea flowering and harvest). The addition of residues to the soil resulted in only small changes to the total C and N pools the Nitouche monocrop, which was found to have the highest potentially mineralisable N (13.4 mu g g(-1) 28 d(-1)) of the treatments with added residue. The different pea cultivar selectively affected N2O emissions, with highest emissions associated with the cultivar Nitouche in the absence of residues. The two intercropping treatments of triticale/pea were significantly different either with residues or without, especially the triticale/Zero4 which had the lowest values (356 g N2O-N ha(-1)). Similar patterns were also observed in below ground data. ARISA analysis showed that monocropped legumes and the Triticale-based treatment clearly grouped on separate clusters to the added residue treatment. We hypothesize that in pea-based intercrops variations in carbon supply from different cultivars may contribute to differences in N2O emissions and thus influence the choice of suitable cultivars, to optimize nutrient cycling and sustainable crop management.

J	LETOURNEAU, DK				LETOURNEAU, DK			ASSOCIATIONAL SUSCEPTIBILITY - EFFECTS OF CROPPING PATTERN AND FERTILIZER ON MALAWIAN BEAN FLY LEVELS	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						"AFRICAN FARMING; ASSOCIATIONAL RESISTANCE; HOST PLANT QUALITY; INTERCROPPING; NATURAL ENEMIES; RESOURCE CONCENTRATION; SUBSISTENCE AGRICULTURE; VARIETAL MIXTURES"	"VEGETATIONAL DIVERSITY; LEAF NITROGEN; HERBIVORE; MONOCULTURES; POLYCULTURES; AGROMYZIDAE; DENSITY; DIPTERA; ECOLOGY"	Subsistence farmers with little access to costly pesticides must rely on cultural practices to enhance biological control, reduce crop apparency or suitability to pests, or increase crop tolerance to pests. Farmers in Central Malawi traditionally plant beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) with the first rains and apply fertilizer to bean only when it is grown in dicultures with maize (Zea mays L.). I used a factorial experiment with a key pest of beans to assess the relative effects of fertilizer (predicted to increase pest levels) and intercropping (predicted to decrease pest densities). Stem-boring bean fly (Diptera: Agromyzidae) densities and their parasitism rates were compared with respect to cropping pattern, fertilizer application, sowing date, and varietal diversity of beans. Together these factors address the effects of current practices (intercropping, mixed varieties) on bean fly infestation rates and those now encouraged for increased production (relay cropping, fertilized monoculture). In addition, associational resistance in this system is tested in the context of actual farming practices. In contrast to many other studies of specialist herbivores, neither the densities of bean flies [Ophiomyia phaseoli (Tryon) and O. spencerella (Greathead)] nor their rates of parasitism were changed significantly by diversifying the field with non-host plants (bean-maize dicultures). However, the two fly species were differentially susceptible to plant quality and parasitism, with fertilized bean plants harboring more bean fly puparia than did unfertilized plants regardless of cropping pattern. Thus, the indirect effect of fertilizing intercrops resulted in elevated pest densities. Differential plant quality has not been included in most studies of intercropping and pest incidence, yet reflects actual farming practices. Bean fly densities tended to increase in plants sown later in the wet season, suggesting that relay cropping of beans will exacerbate bean fly damage.

Organic crop succession of maize and collard greens intercropped with legumes in no-tillage system	HORTICULTURA BRASILEIRA			Portuguese	Article						"Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala; Zea mays L.; Crotalaria spp.; Mucuna spp.; organic agriculture"	PERFORMANCE	"New farming practices have been developed to reduce the application of fertilizer and pesticides and minimize the aggression to the environment, producing healthy foods and environmentally correct. We evaluated the performance of the succession of collard greens (Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala) and corn (Zea mays L.) intercropped with green manure legumes under no-tillage organic system. The study was conducted in Seropedica, Rio de Janeiro State, during two years. We utilized dwarf velvet bean (Mucuna deeringiana) and showy crotalaria (Crotalaria spectabilis) as green manure intercropped with collard greens and in succession sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea) and velvet bean (Mucuna pruriens) intercropped with corn. As a control, there was a single crop system of corn and collard greens. The experimental design was of randomized complete blocks, a factorial 3 (crop system) x 2 (doses of poultry bed manure), with four replications, in plots of 20 m(2). For the collard greens we applied 0 and 5.4 t ha(-1) of poultry bed manure (2.7 t ha(-1) in two applications) in 2003; 0 (zero) and 2.7 t ha(-1) in 2004. In the monocrop system, the yield of collard greens was of 37.7 and 18.4 t ha(-1), intercropped with dwarf velvet bean the yield reached 40.3 and 38.8 t ha(-1) and, using showy crotalaria the yield was of 42.9 and 24.8 t ha(-1), in 2003 and 2004, respectively. The corn was benefited from the residual effect of fertilizer with poultry bed manure increasing the production of ears from 25,625 to 27,916 ha(-1). Crop succession of collard greens and corn, intercropped with annual legumes under organic fertilization as poultry bed manure, showed yield increase for collard greens and corn."

In this study, we tested if biofertilizers can not only enhance the yield of crops in monoculture as has previously been demonstrated but can also enhance the yield of intercropping systems. We hypothesized that because AMF can form common mycorrhizal networks (CMN) that can transfer nutrients and water between different plant species, biofertilization can balance belowground competition between crop species and promote thus overall yields in intercropping systems. In our study, we used a pigeon pea (PP)-finger millet (FM) intercropping system that we grew for two consecutive growing seasons (2016/17 and 2017/18) at two contrasting sites in Bengaluru and Kolli Hills, India. We also tested if the spatial arrangement (i.e., different arrangement of component plants with similar plant density in intercropping system) of intercropped plants, using either a row-wise or a mosaic design, influences the effect of biofertilizers on yield and water relations of the PP-FM intercropping system. Our results demonstrate that intercropping can improve the straw and grain yield of PP and FM compared to the respective monocultures and that intercropping effects vary depending on the site characteristic such as climate and soil type. The spatial arrangement of component plants affected the total, straw, and grain biomass in intercropping treatments, but this effect also varied across sites. Most importantly, the results from the 2017/18 growing season clearly demonstrated a positive effect of biofertilizer on biomass yield, and this effect was irrespective of site, spatial arrangement, mixed or monoculture. Our study therefore shows that yield increase in intercropping systems can further be improved through the application of biofertilizers.

J	"Rose, CW; Adiku, S"				"Rose, CW; Adiku, S"			Conceptual methodologies in agro-environmental systems	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH			English	Article						"simulation; models; Ghana; maize; cowpea"	"SIMULATION; MODEL"	When continuous measurement of relevant above- and below-ground environmental factors is made, and the dynamics of crop growth and phenology is followed, it is shown that small-plot agronomic experimentation can provide information vital to the development and testing of simulation models. Such models for crops of maize (Zen mays) and the legume cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), grown as sole crops and in an intercrop system, were used to simulate yield at two separate sites in the main savanna farming zones in Ghana, West Africa. Simulation was carried out for these three cropping systems using 20 years of historical rainfall data for the two sites, investigating the effect on yield of management options which included time of planting, rate of nitrogen fertilizer application, and crop planting density. The yield results of this series of simulations were then subject to two different types of analysis in order to assist the evaluation of agricultural options for the nation. The first analysis was an economic evaluation based on gross margins, but using the stochastic-dominance technique to rank the profitability of the alternative cropping and management systems. The second, more general methodology employed was multi-criteria analysis (MCA). This analysis covered economic returns and their variability, the amount and quality of residue returned to the soil, and the aerial cover provided by the crop. Other factors which could affect the sustainability of production in the long term, but which could only be evaluated qualitatively, were also included in the analysis, as allowed in MCA methodology. The MCA was then carried out for three scenarios in which different weightings were given to economic outcomes and to factors which are believed to encourage ecological sustainability. These scenarios allow recognition of different priorities which might be given by traditional subsistence farmers as compared to commercial producers. Outcomes of this broad analysis of development alternatives provided scientific support for the traditional Ghanaian practice of grain/legume intercropping which is also widespread in the tropics. The suite of methodologies illustrated by the case study appears to be suitable for the evaluation of alternative farming systems at the scale of a small nation such as Ghana.

The experimental design was a Randomised Complete Block Design (RCBD) replicated three times. Disease scores on tomato-maize differed significantly from tomato-kale and tomato-onion in both years of the study. Maize cropping system had a low significant thrips population from the other cropping systems. Tomato-maize intercrop produced the lowest fruit weights and marketable yield in 2004 and 2006, while yield of onion, kale and maize in intercrops were not significantly different from their monocrops. Land equivalent ratio was > 1 in all the cropping systems.	"[Ramkat, R. C.] Minist Agr, Extens Dept, Nakuru, Kenya; [Wangai, A.

That is my farm - An integrated co-learning approach for whole-farm sustainable intensification in smallholder farming	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						"Input vouchers; Subsidies; Extension services; Iterative cycles; Knowledge; Farming systems analysis"	"SOIL FERTILITY MANAGEMENT; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; WESTERN KENYA; EXPLORING DIVERSITY; DECISION-SUPPORT; YIELD GAPS; SYSTEMS; IMPLEMENTATION; PRODUCTIVITY; AGRICULTURE"	The use of options for sustainable intensification of smallholder farming in sub-Saharan Africa is often limited by knowledge and resource constraints. To address both constraints, we developed and tested an integrated co-learning approach to improve farm level productivity. The approach was tested by differentiating a group of co-learning farmers and a group of comparison farmers in two locations in western Kenya during five seasons. Both groups received a US$ 100 voucher each growing season and the co-learning group also took part in co-learning activities. The integrated co-learning approach was comprised of four complementary elements: input vouchers, an iterative learning process, common grounds for communication, and complementary knowledge. Central to the approach were co-learning workshops before each season. Workshop topics built on topics from previous seasons and on farmers' feedback and researchers' observations. Activities during each season included farm management monitoring, yield measurements and evaluation interviews. This resulted in multiple learning loops for both farmers and researchers. The voucher fostered learning through increased and diversified input use. For instance, intercropped legumes were smothered by the prolific growth of maize resulting from increased fertilizer use. After setting up joint demonstrations, farmers started to use alternative spacing options for intercropping. Building common ground on concepts and processes governing farm system functioning fostered a deeper understanding by farmers on the suitability of options to their farm and by researchers on locally relevant content. Soil fertility gradients was such a concept through which judicious use of fertilizers was discussed. After five seasons, co-learning farmers had a more diverse and cohesive knowledge of their farm than comparison farmers. Co-learning farmers highlighted farm level management options, management of the parasitic weed striga and options for integrated soil fertility management as the most important things they learned. A tangible learning outcome was the continued increase in groundnut and soybean area among co-learning farmers, which led to more diversified maize cropping systems. We attribute these differences to the co-learning process. Our results demonstrate how the integrated co-learning approach changed both knowledge and practices of participating farmers and researchers. The amplifying effects of the four key elements appeared to be important for enabling sustainable intensification of smallholder farming systems.	"[Marinus, Wytze; Descheemaeker, Katrien K.

Fewer ovipositing moths were attracted to (1) low density maize (< 20,000 plants/ha) and to (2) small patches (< 325 m2). (3) In small patches more females oviposited in monocropped than intercropped maize, when offered a choice. Companion crops may interfere with chemical or visual cues emanating from maize. (4) The companion crop may act as a barrier to silk-dispersing first-instar larvae. Plant density and patch size act independently of intercropping, although intercrops are often planted at low maize density. However, the degree of maize borer control from the combined mechanisms is low and intercropping cannot be recommended as a sole means of control. Although important, there was no evidence that intercropping affected natural enemy abundance or that there was any significance to diurnal microclimatic differences of an intercrop. Maize borer behavior in small patches has implications for experimental design of intercropping trials.

Together with most of the legume crops, the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) is a good host for the fungus which causes a range of symptoms, depending on environmental conditions and age of the plant. In addition to charcoal rot, which is a stem or stalk rot disease, the pathogen also causes damping-off and seedling blight in beans. Charcoal rot in the mature plant is associated with senescence which is accelerated by water stress. The disease is most damaging in areas of unreliable rainfall and high temperature. In Kenya, beans are usually grown in mixed stands with maize, sorghum or millet Population pressure has led to the cultivation of beans on land prone to drought. M. phaseolina is one of the most important pathogens affecting all the main crops of the farming systems in the semi-arid areas of eastern Kenya and resistance to charcoal rot is a priority if beans are to be increasingly grown in these areas. The paper reviews the literature on charcoal rot of beans and on other crops where similar work has not been reported specifically for beans.

Agricultural decisions considering the interconnections among water, energy, and food are critical. The consumption of large amounts groundwater and non-renewable energy by the predominant traditional wheat-maize cropping system has caused a serious water shortage in the North China Plain (NCP), which is a large food production region in China. This situation has strained the relationship between water/energy consumption and food production. It is important to seek synergy in the water-energy-food nexus. This paper proposed a relative index of water-energy-food (WEFRI) based on different values of resource consumption and use efficiency between treatment systems and control system to analyze the synergy between water utilization, energy consumption and food supply in different cropping systems at the field scale. The goal is to seek a sustainable cropping system to balance crop production while reducing energy consumption and water depletion. In this case, different systems including monocropped maize (Zea mays) (MM), intercropped maize and soybean (Glycine max) (MS), relay cropped of maize with pea (Pisum sativum) (MP) and potato (Solarium tuberosum) (MO), rotation of maize with spinach (Spinacia oleracea) (MI) and ryegrass (Secale cereale) (MR), and using traditional wheatmaize (Triticum aestivum) (MW) as a control. MM, MS, MP and MO were the best systems within a particular range of food supply reduction. The WEFRI of the MM/MS system was the highest (2.96/2.78). Compared to the MW system, the groundwater consumption of MM/MS was reduced by 73.84%/73.84%, and non-renewable energy inputs were reduced by 48.01%/48.30%; however, the food supply decreased by 48.05%/51.70%. The WEFRI of the MP system was 1.98. In comparison with the MW system, the groundwater consumption of the MP system was reduced by 28.46%, and the non-renewable energy inputs were reduced by 42.68%. However, the food supply decreased by 37.13%. The WEFRI of MO system was 1.92. Compared to the MW system, the groundwater consumption of MO was reduced by 11.47%, non-renewable energy inputs were reduced by 32.14%, and the food supply only decreased by 26.27%. In conclusion, we theoretically proposed the following references for cropping systems in the NCP: MM and MS are implemented when the areas has extreme water shortages, MO is implemented when a less than 30% reduction in the food supply capacity is acceptable, and MP is recommended if a 30%-40% reduction in the food supply is acceptable."

Merr.] + maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean + sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] intercropping systems. The treatments consisted of 4 levels of N (0, 50, 100, 150 kg N/ha) for each of intercropping systems of soybean + maize and soybean + sorghum in alternate rows of 60 cm and with and without recommended dose of N for each sole crop. Number of branches, number of pods, number of seeds/pod, 1,000-seed weight, seed and straw yields and protein yield of soybean decreased significantly when intercropped with maize or sorghum. The maximum branches/plant, pods/plant, seeds/pod and 1,000-seed weight of intercropped soybean system were recorded with 50 kg N/ha in either of intercropping systems. Soybean + maize system fertilized with 50 kg N/ha recorded the highest seed yield (1,088.3 and 767.6 kg/ha) of intercropped soybean, during both the years. Almost similar pattern of seed (796.6 and 770.6 kg/ha) and straw yields (1,633.0 and 1,781.0 kg/ha) of intercropped soybean were also observed in soybean + sorghum system. With increasing the dose of N above 50 kg/ha showed detrimental effect on yield attributes, seed and straw yields of intercropping soybean in both the intercropping system. Protein content of soybean seed was not significantly affected by N, although it improved with N, the highest protein yield of intercropped soybean was recorded under 50 kg N/ha.

However, there are limited studies exploiting biochar (BC) use under different cropping systems in the region. We evaluated nutrient uptake, grain and biomass yields, and economic viabilities of integrated use of BC under cereal- and legume-based cropping systems in Ghana. The two-factor field experiment was conducted in three consecutive cropping seasons and comprised soil amendments (BC, NPK fertilizers, 50% NPK + 50% BC, and control) and cropping systems (sole maize [Zea mays], maize intercropped with soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], sole soybean and cowpea [Vigna unguiculata L.]). Generally, sole application of mineral fertilizers increased (p < .05) maize grain yield more than the 50% NPK+50% BC. Conversely, the 50% NPK + 50% BC generally produced similar yields (p > .05) of cowpea and soybean as the sole application of the 100% recommended NPK rates. For maize biomass yield, 50% NPK + 50% BC generally outperformed the sole NPK and sole BC treatments. Nutrient uptake in maize was higher in sole NPK and the integrated plots under sole cropping than in intercropping system. Nitrogen uptake of maize in 50% NPK + 50% BC was 12-22% higher in sole cropping than in intercropping system. The value/cost ratio under NPK was above the economic threshold (>2.0) under cropping systems. For 50% NPK + 50% BC, the economic threshold was only exceeded under intercropping cropping system, indicating a considerable intercropping benefits in integrated biochar and mineral fertilizer application.

Changing light (CL) from maize shading is the most important environmental feature in MSI. We hypothesized that CL affects isoflavone accumulation in soybean pods, affecting their disease resistance. In the present study, shading treatments were applied to soybean plants during different developmental stages according to various CL environments under MSI. Chlorophyll fluorescence imaging (CFI) and classical evaluation methods confirmed that CL, especially vegetative stage shading (VS), enhanced pod resistance to mildew. Further metabolomic analyses and exogenous jasmonic acid (JA) and biosynthesis inhibitor experiments revealed the important relationship between JA and isoflavone biosynthesis, which had a synergistic effect on the enhanced resistance of CL-treated pods to mildew. VS promoted the biosynthesis and accumulation of constitutive isoflavones upstream of the isoflavone pathway, such as aglycones and glycosides, in soybean pods. When mildew infects pods, endogenous JA signalling stimulated the biosynthesis of downstream inducible malonyl isoflavone (MIF) and glyceollin to improve pod resistance."

In this study, a metabolomics method was applied to analyze fatty acid metabolism of soybeans grown under an intercrop shading condition. The results indicate that the fatty acid contents of the intercropped soybean were significantly higher than those of the sole-cropped soybeans. As the shading effect increased, the soybean fatty acids content showed a rise and fall tendency. Moreover, the partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), Pearson correlation, and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) multivariate analyses showed a similar result. The results suggested that shading can manipulate soybean fatty acid metabolism in a maizesoybean strip intercropping system. Further, the metabolite profiling combined with multivariate statistical analysis can be used as a useful tool for identifying the metabolic links between fatty acid metabolites.

The use of no-tillage, crop rotation, and cover crops can increase the sustainability of cropping systems under these conditions. Nitrogen (N) is important to improve carbon production and soil organic matter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of summer crop rotation (sorghum or soybean), tillage system (no-tillage and conventional), and intercropping (maize and palisade grass) on crop yield (soybean and maize grain, sorghum silage and palisade grass dry matter) and soil nitrogen stocks. No-tillage system (NT) resulted in yields 6% higher for soybean, 100 % higher for sorghum and 17 % higher for maize, when compared to conventional tillage, and had no effect on palisade yield. The high palisade grass yield after soybean in 2014 decreased soil inorganic N stocks in the 0-60 cm layer, but total soil N was higher when using soybean rotation under NT and after intercropped maize in 2015. Soybean increased maize yields by 25 % (0.86 Mg ha(-1)) and palisade yields by 46 % (1.5 Mg ha(-1)) when compared to silage sorghum. Palisade grass decreased maize yield by 30 % with intercropping. Soybean grown under NT after maize and palisade grass intercrop improves soil N stocks and crop yields. Despite palisade grass competition decreasing maize yields in years with rainfall above the historical mean, its use is important to improve soil organic matter over time.

Although rhizosphere microorganisms are important in nutrient cycling processes, the differences in rhizosphere microbial communities between intercropped soybean and corn and their monoculture are poorly known. Additionally, the effects of cadmium (Cd) pollution on these differences have not been examined. Therefore, a field experiment was conducted in Cd-polluted soil to determine the effects of monocultures and soybean-corn intercropping systems on Cd concentrations in plants, on rhizosphere bacterial communities, soil nutrients and Cd availability. Plants and soils were examined five times in the growing season, and Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes was used to analyze the rhizosphere bacterial communities. Results: Intercropping did not alter Cd concentrations in corn and soybean, but changed soil available Cd (ACd) concentrations and caused different effects in the rhizosphere soils of the two crop species. However, there was little difference in bacterial community diversity for the same crop species under the two planting modes. Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were the dominant phyla in the soybean and corn rhizospheres. In ecological networks of bacterial communities, intercropping soybean (IS) had more module hubs and connectors, whereas intercropped corn (IC) had fewer module hubs and connectors than those of corresponding monoculture crops. Soil organic matter (SOM) was the key factor affecting soybean rhizosphere bacterial communities, whereas available nutrients (N, P, K) were the key factors affecting those in corn rhizosphere. During the cropping season, the concentration of soil available phosphorus (AP) in the intercropped soybean-corn was significantly higher than that in corresponding monocultures. In addition, the soil available potassium (AK) concentration was higher in intercropped soybean than that in monocropped soybean. Conclusions: Intercropped soybean-corn lead to an increase in the AP concentration during the growing season, and although crop absorption of Cd was not affected in the Cd-contaminated soil, soil ACd concentration was affected. Intercropped soybean-corn also affected the soil physicochemical properties and rhizosphere bacterial community structure. Thus, intercropped soybean-corn was a key factor in determining changes in microbial community composition and networks. These results provide a basic ecological framework for soil microbial function in Cd-contaminated soil.

Intercropping increased DW compared with the sole species and the increase was higher for the cereals and lupin than for cereals and vetch intercropping systems. Above-ground competition for light reduced DW of cereals and lupin while it did not influence the DW of vetch. Processes involved in below-ground competition increased shoot growth of cereals and reduced shoot growth of legumes. N nutrition of cereals was enhanced by below-ground competition with legumes and N nutrition of vetch was enhanced by above-ground competition with cereals. Cereals had a higher competitive ability than legumes as a result of their below-ground competitive ability. The interaction between above- and below-competition is not predictable: negative, positive and no interaction (additivity) between different types of competition were found. In low-input intercropping systems, when a N-fixing species is present, the mixture of the roots of components is important for the utilization of the soil resources and, when a climbing species is also present, the mixture of shoots can result in an increased utilization of light.
