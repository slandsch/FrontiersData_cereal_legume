It is unknown whether improved water conservation practices can be developed to alleviate this issue while increasing crop productivity. In this study, we developed a double mulching system, i.e., plastic film coupled with straw mulch, integrated together with intensified strip intercropping. We determined (i) the responses of soil evaporation and moisture conservation to the integrated double mulching system and (ii) the change of soil temperature during key plant growth stages under the integrated systems. Experiments were carried out in northwest China in 2009 to 2011. Results show that wheat-maize strip intercropping in combination with plastic film and straw covering on the soil surface increased soil moisture (mm) by an average of 3.8 % before sowing, 5.3 % during the wheat and maize co-growth period, 4.4 % after wheat harvest, and 4.9 % after maize harvest, compared to conventional practice (control). The double mulching decreased total evapotranspiration of the two intercrops by an average of 4.6 % (P < 0.05), compared to control. An added feature was that the double mulching system decreased soil temperature in the top 10-cm depth by 1.26 to 1.31 degrees C in the strips of the cool-season wheat, and by 1.31 to 1.51 degrees C in the strips of the warm-season maize through the 2 years. Soil temperature of maize strips higher as 1.25 to 1.94 degrees C than that of wheat strips in the top 10-cm soil depth under intercropping with the double mulching system; especially higher as 1.58 to 2.11 degrees C under intercropping with the conventional tillage; this allows the two intercrops to grow in a well collaborative status under the double mulching system during their co-growth period. The improvement of soil moisture and the optimization of soil temperature for the two intercrops allow us to conclude that wheat-maize intensification with the double mulching system can be used as an effective farming model in alleviating water shortage issues experiencing in water shortage areas."

At New Mexico State University's Agricultural Science Center at Tucumcari, cereal forage monocultures and intercrops with legumes were subjected to two irrigation treatments during two growing seasons in a Canez fine sandy loam (fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Ustollic Haplargid). Dry matter (DM) yield of monocultures averaged 3.76, 3.90, 5.55, 5.59, and 3.17 Mg ha(-1) for rye (Secale cereale L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), triticale (X Triticosecale rimpaui Wittm.), and oat (Avena sativa L.), respectively. Cereal forages irrigated once in a growing season yielded equally to those watered twice with average precipitation (2000-2001, 408 mm), but not in a dry growing season (2001-2002,245 mm) (6.15,5.41,1.90, and 3.21 Mg ha(-1) for cereal forages irrigated once or twice in 2000-2001 or 2001-2002, respectively). Also, levels of forage nutritive components were greatest when irrigated once in 2001-2002. Intercropping with winter pea [Pisum sativum subsp. arvense (L.) Poir] or hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.) reduced yield of wheat and triticale compared with monocultures, but these yields were still greater than those of the other cereal forages and winter pea improved quality indicators when intercropped with wheat or triticale. Water can be conserved in the Southern High Plains by irrigating cereals only as needed for germination or to promote fall growth.

A randomized complete block design (RCB) with three replications was employed to compare the treatments, including cow pea sole crop (Cp), corn sole crop (C), alternate-row intercropping (M(1)), within-row intercropping (M(2)) and mixed intercropping (M(3)). The intercrop composition was based on replacement design, where one corn was replaced by three cow pea plants. Tic results indicated that PAR (photosyntheticaly active radiation) interception and nutrient uptake were improved by intercropping. Cow pea was more competitive than corn in absorbing divalent cations (Ca and Mg) for its high root cation exchange capacity. However, corn was more competitive than cow pea for phosphorus and potassium. Forage quality of cow pea in terms of crude protein was decreased in intercropping compared to its sole crop. It was related to reduction of biological nitrogen fixation induced by low PAR and phosphorus availability for cow pea in intercropping.

Field experiments have recommended annual winter fallowing (i.e., forgoing winter wheat production) as the most effective way to replenish groundwater. However, adopting the recommendation across the Hebei Plain would lead to a significant reduction in total wheat production. This research aims to find the most favorable water-sustainable cropping systems for different localities in the Hebei Plain, which at the regional aggregation level maintains the uppermost overall levels of wheat and grain production respectively. Our simulations indicate that in the Hebei Plain, an optimal allocation of a wheat-early maize relay intercropping system and an early maize-winter fallow cropping system across the Hebei Plain could lead to significant water savings while minimizing grain production losses to around 11%. Compared to the prevailing wheat and summer maize cropping system, to prevent a drop in the water table, 39% of the current wheat cropping land would need to be fallowed in winter, reducing irrigation water use by 2639 x 106 m(3). Replacing the prevailing wheat and summer maize cropping system with our optimized allocation system could lead to a 36% increase in total maize production and 39% decrease in total wheat production, resulting in total agricultural irrigation water savings of 2322 x 106 m3 and a total grain production reduction by 11%. The findings indicate the potential benefits of our cropping system adaptation method to meet the challenge of recovering local groundwater level with the least possible reduction of wheat and total grain production in the Hebei Plain.

Five cowpea genotypes (2 improved cvv. ITH98-46 and TVu1509, and 3 farmer-selected varieties, namely Bensogla, Sanzie, and Omondaw) were grown in the field at 2 planting densities (83 333 and 166 666 plants/ha) under monoculture and mixed culture with sorghum during 2005 and 2006. Fresh plant roots and rhizosphere soils were collected during the 2 years of experimentation, and assayed for acid and alkaline phosphatase activity. P concentrations in root tissue and rhizosphere soil were also determined using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The data for 2005 and 2006 were similar, and therefore pooled for statistical analysis. Our results showed that raising cowpea density from 83 333 to 166 666 plants/ha significantly increased both acid and alkaline phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere, just as mixed culture ( or intercropping) also increased the acid and alkaline phosphatase activity in cowpea rhizosphere soil. High plant density and mixed culture (or intercropping) also raised the acid phosphatase activity in fresh roots of cowpea plants. The increased enzyme activity in roots and rhizosphere soil resulted in significantly improved P nutrition in cowpea, greater plant growth, and higher grain yield in the farmer-selected varieties, especially cv. Sanzie. This suggests that field-grown legumes can be screened for high P acquisition efficiency by assaying for acid and alkaline phosphatase activities.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of succession cropping on the population of P. brachyurus in soybean. Two experiments were carried out in the greenhouse, using soil naturally-infested with nematodes and the following cropping sequence: soybean (90 d)-treatment (60 d)-soybean (60 d). The treatments were soybean (control), maize, brachiaria grass, intercropped maize-brachiaria, crotalaria, oilseed radish, stylosanthes, and fallow. In the first experiment, the nematode population under brachiaria and intercropped maize-brachiaria was lower that with maize and soybean, but in the second experiment, there was no statistical differences compared to maize. Crop succession with crotalaria, oilseed radish, stylosanthes and fallow promoted the greatest reductions in the population of P. brachyurus.

Intercropping organic field peas with barley, oats, and mustard improves weed control but has variable effects on grain yield and net returns	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						"pea intercropping; organic pea production; integrated weed management"	"COMPETITIVE ABILITY; SPRING CEREALS; PISUM-SATIVUM; GREEN FOXTAIL; SEEDING DATE; WINTER PEA; SOIL N; NITROGEN; WHEAT; PRODUCTIVITY"	Interest in intercropping semi-leafless field peas (Pisum sativum L.) is increasing as a means of weed control in organic production. We evaluated field pea (cv. CDC Amarillo) grown alone or intercropped with three seeding rates of either barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), mustard (Brassica juncea L.), or oat (Avena sativa L.). A full seeding rate of field pea was used in each instance, resulting in an additive intercropping design. Each crop combination was conducted in a separate experiment, three times over two years (2019 and 2020) in Carman, MB. Measurements included crop and weed biomass production, grain yield and quality, and net return. Intercrops reduced weed biomass at maturity from 17% to 44% with barley and oat being more suppressive than mustard. Intercrops also reduced field pea yield from 6% to 26%, but increased field pea seed mass. Barley at the high seeding rate provided the most weed suppression per unit of field pea yield loss (2.62 kg of weed suppression per kg of field pea yield loss) compared with oat (1.29) and mustard (0.87). Barley and mustard intercrops decreased net return compared with monoculture field pea. Under low weed pressure (1150 kg.ha(-1) weed biomass at maturity) and earlier seeding, oat intercrops reduced net return. However, under weedy conditions (2649 kg.ha(-1)) and later seeding, field pea-oat intercrops significantly increased net return. In conclusion, while all three intercrop mixtures reduced weed biomass, reductions in field pea yields were observed, and net return benefits were observed only in certain circumstances.

Salsify (Tragopogon porrifolius L.) of 'Mamut' cv. was the experimental species. The experimental design included three intercrop plants: common vetch, lace phacelia, and oats; two soil tillage ways: a) set of pre-sowing tillage operations, sowing the intercrop plants (mid of August), pre-winter ploughing, mixing the green matter with soil, b) set of pre-sowing tillage operations, sowing the intercrop plants (mid of August), spring ploughing, mixing the plant matter with soil; as well as two plant cultivation manners: on ridges and on flat soil. It was found that spring ploughing made to mix the intercrop biomass with the soil as well as cultivation of plants on ridges significantly increased the total salsify root yields. Significantly positive influence of intercrop plants on salsify root yields, inulin content, inulin yield, and dry matter content was also recorded. Considering the roots yield and their nutritional value, plants cultivated on ridges after spring ploughing and mulching with lace phacelia appeared to be the most beneficial salsify cultivation combination."

Forty eight multiparous (parity 2-4) cows approximately 60 days prepartum and mean live weight 445 S.D. +/- 57 kg at the beginning of the experiment were used in the study. The experiment lasted 200 days each cow, covering 60 days prepartum and 140 days postpartum. Lablab hay supplementation significantly (P < 0.05) increased total DM intake and DM digestibility as compared with the unsupplemented diets but there was no significant (P > 0.05) difference in total DM intake among the supplemented cows. Cows fed ML stover or OV hay supplemented with lablab hay had improved rumen environment as reflected in the rates of DM, OM, N and NDF degradation greater than 0.03 (i.e. 3%) per h. The degradation parameters; a, b, c and the effective degradability (ED) were higher (P < 0.001) for lablab hay supplemented diets than for ML stover or OV hay basal forages fed alone. ML stover fed alone resulted into significantly (P < 0.001) higher Ca, P, and Mg intake than OV hay fed alone while K intake was significantly (P < 0.05) higher with OV hay. Increasing levels of fablab hay supplementation significantly (P < 0.001) increased Ca, P and Mg intakes but did not significantly (P > 0.05) affect K intake in both ML stover and OV hay diets. OV hay and ML stover basal forages fed to unsupplemented crossbred cows resulted into average milk yields of 6.82 and 8.25 kg/cow per days respectively, over a lactation period of 140 days after calving. Supplementation with lablab hay significantly (P < 0.001) increased milk yield of crossbred cows fed OV hay but for ML stover based diets, supplementation was only significant (P < 0.05) at the lowest level (0.4% BW) of lablab offer. For ML stover based treatments, the highest daily milk yield (9.5 kg/head) was obtained at 0.4% of body weight (BW) lablab hay supplementation, while for OV hay treatments, the highest milk yield of 9.7 kg/head was obtained at 1.2% BW lablab hay supplementation. Mean concentrations of milk fat, protein and total solids were similar for both ML stover and OV hay diets fed alone but lablab hay supplementation did not significantly affect the concentration of milk components of cows fed both forages. It was concluded that for optimum milk production from crossbred cows fed ML stover and OV hay basal diets, supplementation should be at 0.52 and 0.85% of BW level of lablab hay, respectively. The lack of response to higher levels of lablab hay supplement despite the increased protein intake was interpreted as resulting from a deficit of dietary energy. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Australian-110) - alfalfa (Medicago sativa L. cv. Cuf 101 USA) forage production, quality and land and water use efficiencies to three irrigation water regimes and six intercropping mixing ratios. The main plots were 100, 80 and 60% of crop water requirement (WR). Under each water regime six intercropping ratios: IC1 (1 row alfalfa: 1 row blue panic), IC2 (2 alfalfa: 1 blue panic), IC3 (3 alfalfa: 1 blue panic), IC4 (4 alfalfa: 2 blue panic), IC5 (alfalfa sole crop) and IC6 (blue panic sole crop) were investigated. Results revealed that difference in fresh and dry forage yields between the 100% WR and 80% WR treatments were minimal in all cuts. The IC5 produced the least forage yield while IC6 produced the highest compared to all treatments. The IC1 produced the highest forage yield compared with IC2, IC3 and IC4. Irrigation water use efficiency of 80% WR was higher than in 100% WR but fewer than in 60% WR. The highest land equivalent ratio was obtained from IC1. Intercropping ratios increased protein content in forage compared to blue panic sole plantation. Applying 80% WR reduced dry matter yield by 10% while saving 20% of irrigation water. Applying 60% WR reduced dry matter yield by 20.7% while saving 40% of irrigation water.

In a field study, the growth, grain yield and economic traits were studied under different intercropping systems in direct seeded rice under strip plantation at the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad for two consecutive years. The intercropping systems comprised rice alone, rice + maize, rice + sesbania, rice + mungbean, rice + ricebean, rice + cowpea and rice + pigeonpea. Rice was seeded in 75 cm spaced 4-row strips (15/75 cm), while the intercrops as forage were seeded on the vacant spaces between the rice strips. The results revealed that dry matter of rice was decreased substantially due to intercropping of different forage legumes and non-legumes as compared to sole cropping of rice. Rice growth was more suppressed with a sesbania companion crop than with maize because of relatively thick shading effect of sesbania due to its vigorous vegetative growth rate. The results also revealed that rice grain yield was decreased to a significant level by forage intercrops compared to monocropped rice, which varied from 10.94 to 25.87%, with the maximum (25.87%) by sesbania against the minimum (10.94%) by maize intercrop. Among the intercrops, maize grown in association with rice produced significantly the highest forage yield (40.70 t ha(-1)). In terms of total rice grain yield equivalent (TRGYE), the highest TRGYE (6.45 t ha(-1)) was recorded for rice + forage maize intercropping system. Similarly the net field benefits obtained from different intercropping systems were considerably higher than the sole cropping of rice. The maximum net benefit of Rs. 42325 ha(-1) was recorded for rice + maize, which is 37.32% more than sole rice. The dominance analysis showed that rice + maize, rice + cowpea and rice+pigeonpea intercropping systems are more profitable than growing rice alone and other intercropping systems. According to marginal rate of return, the highest MMR (2244%) was realized from rice + forage maize intercropping system followed by rice+cowpea (158%) against rice alone. It was also inferred from all sensitivity analysis options that rice+maize and rice+cowpea intercropping systems were economical and viable against sole rice.

The mixed cultivation of crops may be an alternative to increase nutrient cycling and to improve productivity. To evaluate intercrops of green manure and corn, soil chemical characteristics, green manure dry matter production and its mineral composition and corn yield were determined in a field experiment carried out between 1995 and 1997 on an Aleudalf Soil in Piracicaba, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Corn was sown in rows spaced 90 cm apart to obtain approximately 50,000 plants per hectare. The treatments consisted of four green manure species: dwarf mucuna [Mucuna deeringiana (Bort.) Merr], dwarf pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L.), crotalaria (Crotalaria spectabilis Roth), jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis L.), plus a control without green manure. Green manure species were sown without fertilizer application in a single row in-between the rows simultaneously with corn or 30 days after corn sowing. The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks in split plots and four replicates. Jack bean produced most phytomass and accumulated the highest amounts of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and S. In the first year of cultivation, the corn yields were not affected by the intercropped cultivation with green manure, but in the second year the yield was highest when corn was intercropped with jack bean.

Rhizobium inoculation reduces P and K fertilization requirement in corn-soybean intercropping	RHIZOSPHERE			English	Article							"PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS L.; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; N-2 FIXATION; SOIL N; PHOSPHORUS; MOLYBDENUM; MAIZE; CROPS; YIELD; IRON"	"The field experiment was carried out at Tanzania Coffee Research Institute (TaCRI) for two consecutive years to assess the effects of Rhizobium inoculation, supplemented with phosphorus and potassium on nutrient uptake in soybean intercropped with maize. The experiment was laid out in split-split plot design with 2x4x7 factorial arrangement replicated thrice. The main plots had two rhizobial inoculation treatments, while the sub plots were comprised of four cropping systems: Maize (sole-crop), Soybean (sole-crop) and two intercropping at different soybean spacing (75 x 20 and 75 x 40 cm). The sub-subplots were assigned to fertilizer levels (kg ha(-1)): control; 20K; 40K; 26P; 52P; 26P + 20K; 52P + 40K. The statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA. The fisher's L.S.D. was used to compare treatment means at p=0.05 level of significance. The results indicated that soybean pure-stand significantly improved the uptake of Mg over the soybean under intercropping systems for the two cropping seasons. The uptake of Fe increased in intercropped soybean for the first cropping season relative to soybean pure stand. Rhizobium inoculation significantly improved the uptake of all other macro nutrients (N, K, P, and Mg) and micronutrients (Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn) in soybean shoots over un-inoculated soybean. Fertilization of soybean with P and K significantly increased the uptake of N, P and K for both cropping seasons. However, the uptake of macro nutrients such as calcium (Ca) and Magnesium (Mg) and micro nutrients such as Fe and Cu decreased with the increase of P and K fertilizers. P and K fertilization did not significantly affect the uptake of Mg and Mn for the two cropping seasons. Based on the findings of this study, Rhizobium inoculation and P and K fertilization at lower rates are recommended for improved uptake of macro and micro nutrients in legumes such as soybean."

Perennial legume intercrops provide multiple belowground ecosystem services in smallholder farming systems	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"Belowground ecosystem services; Perennial legumes; Intercropping; Sustainability; Push-pull; Sub-Saharan Africa; Soil organic matter; Particulate organic matter; Smallholder farming systems"	"PUSH-PULL TECHNOLOGY; SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER; STRIGA-HERMONTHICA; CROPPING SYSTEMS; DESMODIUM SPP.; SUSTAINABLE INTENSIFICATION; ECOLOGICAL INTENSIFICATION; AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY; INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT; ECONOMIC-PERFORMANCE"	Soil degradation is a major underlying cause of poverty and malnutrition in smallholder agrarian communities across the globe. Legume diversification, through polyculture or intercropping, is a strategy that increases yields and income while improving family nutrition. However, the potential for these legume-cereal intercrops to restore soil functions in smallholder fields remains uncertain, with many studies failing to detect increases in soil organic matter (SOM). In sub-Saharan Africa, smallholders typically grow maize either intercropped with shortlived annual food legumes or as a monoculture. Recently, a novel maize system which includes perennial legumes in the genus Desmodium as intercrops, known as push-pull (hereafter, PP) has been increasingly adopted by smallholders across the region. The yield, nutritional and economic benefits of the PP system are welldocumented. We investigated the effects of PP maize intercropping on soil fertility compared to the predominant maize culture systems (hereafter, NPP) using soils from long-term experiments and smallholder fields in western Kenya. Maize-desmodium intercrops promoted SOM accrual and increased plant available phosphorus. In the long-term research station experiments soil organic N was 20% greater and labile organic N reserves were five-fold greater in PP compared to NPP soils. Despite equal P fertilizer application rates, extractable soil P was two-fold greater in PP compared to NPP soils. Soils under maize-food legume intercrops did not show any detectable accrual of SOM compared to maize monocultures. Soil benefits in smallholder PP fields tended to mirror those found in the controlled experiments. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the perennial legumes in PP system restore soil function and fertility. Developing additional well-designed intercropping systems that include perennial legumes could play a significant role in reversing the trajectory of soil degradation in smallholder farming systems while enhancing human well-being.

We hypothesize that unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) would provide high-resolution spectral signatures for effectively discerning agronomic and crop conditions, management practices, and yields in smallholder farms for crop yield outlooks. The current study explores potential in using UAV-mounted sensor spectral signatures for monitoring crop conditions in smallholder agriculture. Images were collected using a 4-band multispectral camera mounted on a small fixed wing UAV, flown at 8-day interval over maize-pigeonpea experimental plots at Sokoine University of Agriculture and maize monocrop in farmers' fields nearby, during 2015/2016 growing season. Four spectral vegetation indices (VIs) namely; normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI), red edge chlorophyll index (CIred-edge), and the green chlorophyll index (CIgreen), were evaluated under maize monocrop, maize pigeonpea-intercrop, fertilizer and non-fertilizer and two maize varieties conditions. VIs were used also to detect differences in farm management practices of two farmers' maize fields. The response of the spectral VIs varied depending on phenological stage of the crop and imposed treatments or management practices. In experimental plots, NDVI was able to distinguish fertilized from non-fertilized plots at all times, distinguish between two maize varieties at 52days after sowing (DAS), and differentiate monocropped maize from maize-pigeonpea intercrop at 60 DAS. CIred-edge could detect effect of maize-pigeonpea intercrop and maize varieties at 44 DAS, whereas CIgreen could detect variety differences at 44 DAS, intercropping effect at all times and fertilizer effects at 60 and 68 DAS. WDRVI could only detect variety differences and maize-pigeonpea intercrop at 44 DAS. Moreover, NDVI was slightly associated with maize yield in non-fertilized plots (coefficient of determination - R-2=0.58) and CIgreen was associated with leaf area index (LAI) (R-2=0.62) in fertilized plots and in monocropped plots (R-2=0.61). CIgreen could also differentiate well managed from poorly managed farmer's fields. We conclude that UAV-derived spectral signatures can provide detailed information for characterizing agronomic and crop conditions under smallholder agricultural settings and aid food security monitoring efforts."

J	"Snapp, SS; Rohrbach, DD; Simtowe, F; Freeman, HA"				"Snapp, SS; Rohrbach, DD; Simtowe, F; Freeman, HA"			Sustainable soil management options for Malawi: can smallholder farmers grow more legumes?	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"soil fertility; southern Africa; Malawi; female-headed households; resource management; adoption constraints; pigeonpea; Tephrosia vogelii"	"MAIZE; YIELD"	Sole-cropped, unfertilized maize is the dominant cropping system throughout southern Africa. Yields have become stagnant and legumes are frequently advocated as an affordable option for resource poor farmers, to enhance productivity. Farmer participatory research was employed to test legume intensification as a means to improve maize-based systems in Malawi. A range of,options were evaluated, from grain/legume intercrops of. long-duration pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) rotated with maize (Zea mays), to a relay green manure system of maize with Tephrosia vogelii (Fishbean). Two years of on-farm experimentation indicated that under on-farm conditions legume-intensified systems produced residues that contained about 50 kg N/ha per year, two-fold higher than sole-cropped maize residues. Grain yields from legume-intensified systems were comparable to yields from continuous sole maize, even in a dry lakeshore ecology. These preliminary findings were linked to farmer assessment, where farmers participating in the trials expressed strong interest in the technologies. Yet the probability of adoption remains uncertain. Associated surveys outlined constraints and trade-offs underlying technology choice, information that is not usually considered in conjunction with on-farm trials. Although the legumes were highly productive, farmers expressed worries about the marginal loss of maize production. While the trial performance was similar across regions, differences in market condition, farm resources and household composition appears to stimulate different technology choices. Farmers weigh the benefits of weed suppression and potential cash earnings, against the costs of seed, problems of seed access, labor requirements and problems of grain market access and price. Surveyed farmers commonly manage residues by burning. Promotion and experimentation with more efficient use of legume residues may offer higher short-term impacts than efforts to promote adoption of another cash crop. Ultimately, adoption and soil fertility benefits may depend on market returns to legume production. This study documents the value of researchers and farmers partnering in evaluation of technologies, adoption constraints and competing technology choices. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Increasing the row spacing increased the seed yield of V. pannonica from 881.0 to 1248.0 kg ha(-1). On average, in a pure stand the seed yield of V. pannonica was 1141.0 kg ha(-1). In mixtures with barley and triticale, the seed yield of V. pannonica averaged 986.0 and 1143.0 kg ha(-1), respectively. In single mixed stands the seed yield of V. pannonica varied between 551.0 kg ha(-1) (60 % support plant barley) and 1603.0 kg ha(-1) (20 % support plant triticale). The yield advantage of V. pannonica in this triticale mixture was 40 % compared to the V. pannonica pure stand. With respect to the total yield in the mixture with 20 % triticale (1902.0 kg ha(-1)) the yield advantage over the V. pannonica pure stand was as high as 65.1 %. In the mixed stands the number of seeds per pod and the thousand-seed weight of V. pannonica were higher than in V. pannonica pure stands.

Maintaining regional grain production level and recovering local groundwater table by cropping system adaptation across the North China Plain	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Article						"Agricultural water saving; Cropping system adaptation; Relay intercropping; the North China pain"	"WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; WINTER-WHEAT; SPRING MAIZE; IRRIGATION MANAGEMENT; PRODUCTION POTENTIALS; SUSTAINABLE WATER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LOESS PLATEAU; YIELD; MODEL"	"Insufficient precipitation and continuous over-exploitation of groundwater for agricultural irrigation led to rapid drop of groundwater table in a large part of the North China Plain (NCP), the bread basket of China. It has become widely acknowledged that current practice of winter wheat-summer maize sequential cropping system (WM-S) in the NCP will have to come to an end as soon as possible. Great research efforts have been made at the local level via both field experiments and model simulations to construct groundwater neutral cropping systems but virtually all such constructs show a substantial penalty on total output per unit of land per year. In this research, we propose a strategy to meet the double challenge of maintaining regional grain production level and recovering local groundwater table: 1) Widely adopt winter fallow and early-sowing summer maize monocropping (E-M) in water scarce part of the region to enable groundwater recovery; 2) replace WM-S by wheat-maize relay intercropping system (WM-R) in the water richer part of the NCP to increase grain production so as to compensate yield losses in the water scarce part of the region. Our simulations using DSSAT 4.6 at the site level show that both yield and water productivity of E-M are 33.7% and 41.8% higher than those of existing summer maize, with less than 20% of increase in water requirement. In comparison with spring maize, E-M requires 62.4% less irrigation water, with a yield penalty of only 4.52%. At the regional scale, the simulations targeting at maximizing groundwater saving in water scarce area subject to maintaining the current level of regional total output indicate that about 20.45% of the wheat planting area can be put on fallow in winter, most of which is located in the driest regions of the NCP. This can result in a large amount of groundwater saving at 5.62 x 10(9) m(3) and a substitution of wheat by maize at 24.3% of the total wheat output. These findings provide new rooms for the relevant policy makers and stakeholders to address the urgent groundwater recovering issues in the northern NCP without compromising the level of food grain production of the region.

The model, therefore, considers root water extraction to be a minimization problem whose solution can be sought using a dynamic programming framework. We tested the model by simulating the variations of the soil water content using the time and depth of a maize-sorghum intercrop experiment reported for an 8-day drying cycle by Ozier-Lafontaine et al, (Plant and Soil 204:183-201, 1998), Simulated patterns follow the observed water content distribution quite well. Furthermore, results from numerical experiments show that the model is capable of simulating a range of water extraction patterns in a realistic manner. Patterns of water extraction from uniformly wet soil profiles follow those of the root distribution with depth. The extraction rate is highest in the section where the root length density is also highest. Once the soil profile dries out, water extraction patterns cease to bear any similarity to root distribution. Model simulations also show increased root activity at greater depths when the top sections of the soil dry out. Generally, the model avoids the need to make any prior assumptions about the pattern of the root water extraction.

Specifically, the sorghum rhizosphere soil bacterial community structures under different cropping patterns were characterized. Methods Plot-based experiments were conducted on coastal salt pans reclaimed in 2015. Five treatments were set, i.e., monocropped sorghum (S), monocropped wild soybean (WS), row-cropped sorghum each row with one row of wild soybean (S1WS1), row-cropped sorghum each row with two rows of wild soybean (S1WS2), and mixed intercropping of sorghum and wild soybean (SWS), to study the biomass, yield of the sorghum and wild soybean, and rhizosphere soil of the sorghum. High-throughput sequencing methods were used to analyze the changes in rhizosphere soil bacterial community under the different cropping patterns, and redundancy analysis was conducted to reveal the relationship between the bacterial community structure and soil environmental factors. Results Compared with S, the yield increase rates under S1WS1, S1WS2, and SWS patterns were 10.16%, 13.15%, and 40.68%, respectively. The land equivalent ratios (LER) above 1 reflected the superiority of intercropping. Under the S1WS1, S1WS2, and SWS patterns, soil organic matter content increased, soil nitrogen and phosphorus contents increased, soil enzyme activity improved, and soil pH and salinity decreased. The Ace, Chao, and Shannon indices peaked under the SWS pattern, reaching 1.12, 1.12, and 1.04 times as high as those under monocropping. Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Chloroflexi were the dominant bacterial phyla with an abundance above 10%. Soil nitrate nitrogen, alkaline phosphatase, and nitrogen to phosphorus ratio were the main environmental factors affecting bacterial community structure. Conclusion The crop yield increase rate, LER, soil organic matter, and nitrogen and phosphorus contents all increased under the S1WS1, S1WS2, and SWS patterns, and the above indexes peaked which appeared in the SWS pattern. The SWS pattern showed the best yield and land improvement advantages. Therefore, the SWS pattern was most conducive to achieve intercropping superiority and the best land improvement effect.

Using a structured questionnaire, 300 farmers were selected through multistage random sampling techniques. The data collected were subjected to descriptive analysis of simple proportions and percentages. Findings from the study revealed that 72% of the respondents engaged in both crop and livestock production. Intercropping was the dominant cropping system with cassava, yam, and maize as the principal arable crops, while cocoa, kolanut, oil palm, rubber, cashew, banana/ plantain and citrus were the main permanent crops. The dominant fallow period was found to be three to four years and most farm sizes were less than 2 hectares. The study also showed that 88% of the respondents knew of fertilizer, 61% knew of other agrochemicals, while 56% and 16% utilized them, respectively. Findings generally point to inefficiencies in some of the existing farming practices. Addressing the constraints identified in this study may improve the farming systems in the study area and thus increase agricultural production on a sustainable basis.

The paper is based on a comprehensive data set collected in 2013 from 1582 farm households located in three regions of Malawi (northern, central, and eastern). The study uses a bivariate probit model to examine the role of farm characteristics-including physical, human, social, and financial capital-in the household's decision to adapt to climatic shocks. The results revealed that farmers in the study area experienced droughts, floods, and crop pests and diseases as key climatic shocks. Additionally, some indirect climatic shocks reported by farmers include crop damages, increases in input and output prices, and reductions in farm profit. Farmers adopted more on-farm work, drought-tolerant varieties, early planting, and intercropping as key ex-ante adaptation strategies to reduce the adverse impacts of extreme climate events. Farmers adopted drought and disease-tolerant crops, diversified their crops, planted earlier, did more on-farm work, and changed their eating habits as key ex-post climatic shock coping strategies. Furthermore, social networks and capital were found to be important factors influencing farmers' adaptation decisions. The study suggests improving access to community resources, infrastructure, and information in order to improve household capacity to cope with climatic shocks.

J	"Nelson, RA; Cramb, RA"				"Nelson, RA; Cramb, RA"			Economic incentives for farmers in the Philippine uplands to adopt hedgerow intercropping	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						"hedgerows; soil erosion; adoption; sustainability; cost-benefit analysis; Philippines"	"MAIZE; GROWTH; MODEL"	"Land degradation in the Philippine uplands is severe and widespread. Most upland areas are steep, and intense rainfall on soils disturbed by intensive agriculture can produce high rates of soil loss. This has serious implications for the economic welfare of a growing upland population with few feasible livelihood alternatives. Hedgerow intercropping can greatly reduce soil loss from annual cropping systems and has been considered an appropriate technology for soil conservation research and extension in the Philippine uplands. However; adoption of hedgerow intercropping has been sporadic and transient, rarely continuing once external support has been withdrawn. The objective of this paper is to investigate the economic incentives for farmers in the Philippine uplands to adopt hedgerow intercropping relative to traditional open-field maize farming. Cost-benefit analysis is used to compare the economic viability of hedgerow intercropping, as it has been promoted to upland farmers, with the viability of traditional methods of open-field farming. The APSIM and SCUAF models were used to predict the effect of soil erosion on maize yields from open-field farming and hedgerow intercropping. The results indicate that there have been strong economic incentives for farmers with limited planning horizons to reject hedgerow intercropping because the benefits of sustained yields are not realized rapidly enough to compensate for high establishment costs. Alternative forms of hedgerow intercropping such as natural vegetation and grass strips reduce establishment and maintenance costs and are therefore more economically attractive to farmers than hedgerow intercropping with shrub legumes. The long-term economic viability of hedgerow intercropping depends on the economic setting and the potential for hedgerow intercropping to sustain maize production relative to traditional open-field farming.

J	Ghaffarzadeh, M				Ghaffarzadeh, M			Economic and biological benefits of intercropping berseem clover with oat in corn-soybean-oat rotations	JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE			English	Article							"LEGUME COVER CROPS; NO-TILLAGE CORN; NITROGEN-SOURCE; GRAIN-SORGHUM; YIELD"	Sustainability of Iowa agriculture may require change from predominantly a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.] rotation to more diverse cropping systems. Alternative crops are vital for providing temporal diversity. Reincorporating small grains into a three-crop rotation with corn and soybean can provide greater temporal diversity, especially if a forage legume is included as a companion crop, A field study was established in 1991 on a Kenyon (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludoll) soil to evaluate the economic and biological benefits of an oat (Avena sativa L.) crop underseeded with berseem clover (trifolium alexandrinum L.) in a three crop- rotation. Two rotation treatments were compared: (i) corn-soybean-oat and (ii) corn-soybean-oat intercropped with berseem clover. In 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995, oat grain yield was not significantly changed when berseem clover was underseeded with the oat crop. However, in 5 yr, oat underseeded with berseem clover produced up to 70% more biomass (harvested material without the grain) than sole-crop oat straw. The biomass (40% oat straw and 60% berseem clover forage) also had adequate digestible material (51%) to be considered as low quality forage. Berseem clover regrowth after oat grain harvest produced an average 1.2 tons/acre of forage, which could have been harvested for hay or left in the field as green manure. During this trial, berseem clover regrowth was left as groundcover and green manure, which contributed an average of 39 lb N/acre to the succeeding corn crop. Corn grain yields following berseem clover were 10% higher over the trial period. Soybean grain yields were the same for both treatments. Intercropping berseem clover with oat returned an average of $39/acre more than sole-crop oat. This study demonstrated both economic and biological advantages for more diverse cropping practices.

A. College of Agriculture, Anand Agricultural University, Anand during 2002-03 and 2003-04 to assess the impact of intercropping on natural enemies of insect-pests infesting cotton. Cotton (cultivar H-10) crop was intercropped alternately with maize, sesame and soybean. Experimental results of two years' study concluded that cotton intercropped with maize, sesame and soybean enhanced the population of various natural enemies of insect-pests attacking cotton. Cotton intercropped with maize registered relatively higher number of entomophagous insects followed by cotton + sesame and cotton + soybean. Population of natural enemies increased in all the intercropping treatments as evident from the relatively more numbers of biocontrol agents over cotton as sole crop. Plots treated with insecticides exhibited minimum number of natural enemies suggesting its detrimental effect on the beneficial fauna. The suppression of sucking pests and bollworms incidence, with an increase in seed cotton yield in the intercropping treatments, was attributed to an increase in arthropod natural enemies, which suppressed the insect-pests infesting cotton.

Many researchers are investigating these interactions among the plant species but knowledge about the effect of these interactions on the establishment and growth is limited. Therefore, the effect of plant-plant interactions on forage yield and quality were investigated in pea-cereal mixtures under Central Anatolia conditions during the 2018 and 2019 years. Forage pea were sown using different densities (80, 100, 120 plants m(-2)) and as binary mixtures with 50-75 % reduced seeding ratio of oat, silage maize, and Sudangrass as a mixture. The highest dry matter yield was 7224.7 kg ha(-1) and, obtained from 50 % reduced silage maize + 100 plants m(-2) forage pea mixture. All mixtures increased dry matter yield but decreased the crude protein content concerning forage pea monoculture. Sudangrass mixtures negatively affect the crude protein content in the mixture and decreased it down to 14.58 % but it was, nevertheless, considerably high. Forage NDF and ADF contents were generally higher in Sudangrass mixtures. Above-and below-ground relative neighbor effects (ARNE and BRNE respectively) were facilitative under stressful climate conditions of 2018 but they shifted into competition in 2019. The cereals used in the mixtures caused a competitive effect on forage pea in terms of BRNE.

Many researchers are investigating these interactions among the plant species but knowledge about the effect of these interactions on the establishment and growth is limited. Therefore, the effect of plant-plant interactions on forage yield and quality were investigated in pea-cereal mixtures under Central Anatolia conditions during the 2018 and 2019 years. Forage pea were sown using different densities (80, 100, 120 plants m(-2)) and as binary mixtures with 50-75 % reduced seeding ratio of oat, silage maize, and Sudangrass as a mixture. The highest dry matter yield was 7224.7 kg ha(-1) and, obtained from 50 % reduced silage maize + 100 plants m(-2) forage pea mixture. All mixtures increased dry matter yield but decreased the crude protein content concerning forage pea monoculture. Sudangrass mixtures negatively affect the crude protein content in the mixture and decreased it down to 14.58 % but it was, nevertheless, considerably high. Forage NDF and ADF contents were generally higher in Sudangrass mixtures. Above-and below-ground relative neighbor effects (ARNE and BRNE respectively) were facilitative under stressful climate conditions of 2018 but they shifted into competition in 2019. The cereals used in the mixtures caused a competitive effect on forage pea in terms of BRNE. The results indicated that plant-plant interactions could significantly affect the forage yield, quality, and competition. Forage pea (100 plants m(-2)) could be cultivated as a second crop when sown as a binary mixture using 50% reduced silage maize (5000 plants m(-2)).

So far, the population and pathogenicity of the seedborne fungi associated with intercropped soybean remain unexplored. In this study, seeds of 12 soybean cultivars screened for intercropping were collected from three growing regions in Sichuan Province of Southwest China, and the seedborne fungi were isolated from the surface-sterilized seeds. Based on sequence analysis of ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (rDNA ITS),148 isolates were identified into 13 fungal genera, among whichFusariumcovered 55.0% as the biggest population followed byColletotrichum. Furthermore,Fusariumisolates were classified into five distinct species comprisingF. fujikuroi,F. proliferatum,F. verticillioides,F. asiaticumandF. incarnatumthrough sequence analysis of translation elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) and DNA-directed RNA ploymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2). Among them,F. fujikuroiaccounted for 51.22% (42/82) and was isolated from 91.7% (11/12) soybean varieties. Pathogenicity assay showed that fiveFusariumspecies were able to infect the seeds of soybean cultivar Nandou12 and caused water-soaked or rot symptoms, whileF. fujikuroiandF. asiaticumhad much higher aggressiveness than other species with significant reductions of seed fresh weight and germination percentage. Accordingly, this study indicates thatFusariumspecies are the dominant seedborne fungi in the intercropped soybean in Sichuan, China, and this provides some useful references for the effective management of seedborne fungal diseases as well as soybean resistance breeding in maize/soybean relay strip intercropping."

Four doses of nitrogen (0, 60, 120 or 180 kg N ha(-1)) constituted the main plots and six cover crop treatments the sub-plots. The cover crop treatments were red clover (Trifolium pratense L). white clover (Trifolium repens L) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) in pure stands and in mixtures. The winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was harvested in August and the cover crops were ploughed under in November. The risk of N leaching was assessed in November by measuring the content of mineral N in the soil profile (0-30, 30-90 cm). In the following year, the residual effects of the cover crops were investigated in spring barley (Hordeum distichon L) without additional N. Under-sowing of cover crops did not influence wheat yield, while reduced N fertiliser dose decreased yield and increased the clover content of the cover crops. When N was applied, the mixed cover crops were as effective in depleting soil mineral nitrogen as a pure ryegrass cover crop, while pure clover was less efficient. The clover content at wheat harvest as well as the amount of N incorporated with the cover crops had a positive correlation with barley yield. Spring barley in the unfertilised treatments yielded, on average, 1.9-2.4 Mg DM ha(-1) more in treatments with clover cover crops than in the treatment without cover crops. However, this positive effect decreased as the N dose to the preceding wheat crop increased, particularly when the clover was mixed with grass. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

OIKOS			English	Article							"COMPETITIVE ABILITY; DENSITY; MIXTURES; INTERFERENCE; PROPORTION; INTERCROPS; ADVANTAGES; GRASSLAND; MODELS; MAIZE"	It has been conjectured that species mixtures ought to be more productive than corresponding pure stands, but experimental evidence for this has not been strong. Data extracted from 54 published experiments involving binary species associations are used to test the conjecture. Mixtures and pure stands are compared on the basis of relative land output: the ratio of yields generated by equivalent populations per species occupying the same total land area and growing under similar conditions. The comparison is made directly using observed biomass yields as well as with yields estimated from yield-density relationships. Mixtures prove to be significantly more productive than pure stands in 38 experiments, and are significantly loser in 8 experiments. On average, mixtures are 12% more productive than pure stands, based on 202 direct observations, or 13% more productive, based on 604 estimates using yield-density relationships.

However, insufficient knowledge on the performance of various options in the context of smallholder farm systems impedes local adaptation and adoption. Therefore, together with farmers in southern Mali we tested a range of options for sustainable intensification including intensification of cereal (maize and sorghum) and legume (groundnut, soyabean and cowpea) sole crops and cereal legume intercropping during three years on on -farm trials. There was huge variability among fields in crop yields of unamended control plots: maize yielded from 0.20 to 5.24t ha(-1), sorghum from 0 to 3.53 t ha(-1), groundnut from 0.10 to 1.16 t ha(-1), soyabean from 0 to 2.48 t ha(-1) and cowpea from 0 to 1.02 t ha(-1). This variability was partly explained by (i) soil type and water holding capacity, (ii) previous crop, its management and the nutrient carry-over and (iii) inter -annual weather variability. Farmers recognized three soil types: gravelly soils, sandy soils and black soils. Yields were very poor on gravelly soils and two to three times greater (depending on the crop) on black soils. Yields were also poor at the end of the typical crop rotation, i.e., after sorghum and millet, and 1.3-1.7 times greater (depending on the crop) after the fertilized crops maize and cotton. We diagnosed a number of cases of technology failure where no improvement in yield was observed with hybrid varieties of maize and sorghum and rhizobial inoculation of soyabean. Regardless of soil type and previous crop, mineral fertilizer improved yields by 34-126% depending on the crop. Targeting options to a given soil type and/or place in the rotation enhanced their agronomic performance: (i) the biomass production of the cowpea fodder variety was doubled on black soils compared with gravelly soils, (ii) the additive maize/cowpea intercropping option after cotton or maize resulted in an average overall LER of 1.47, no maize grain penalty, and 1.38 t ha -1 more cowpea fodder production compared with sole maize. Soil type and position in the rotation, two indicators easy to assess by farmers and extension workers, allowed the identification of specific niches for enhanced agronomic performance of legume sole cropping and/or intercropping.

This study is to evaluate the absorption characteristics of different plant species and planting patterns for heavy metals. Five plant species (tomato, maize, greengrocery, cabbage, and Japan clover herb) were cultivated in monoculture and in intercropping in soil contaminated with heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Cr, Cu, and Fe), to determine the absorption status. Tomato absorbs greater amounts of heavy metals (especially Cd). Furthermore, accumulation of heavy metals increased when tomato was intercropped with other plant species. Maize accumulates greater amounts of Cr, Cu, and Fe. The heavy metal concentrations were reduced when maize was intercropped. Cd and Pb accumulated more in roots of Japan Clover Herb, and the levels of all five heavy metals decreased when intercropped. Tomato intercropping is a feasible method for phytoremediation of heavy metal-contaminated soil, and maize intercropping is feasible for obtaining safe harvest which can be eaten securely.

Here, the intercropping of maize and pea in strips under various N managements was used as a means to alleviate the inhibitory effect of mineral N on pea nodulation and N-2 fixation and to improve system performance. Methods N natural abundance (delta N-15) analysis was employed to quantify N-2 fixation in the 3 years (2012 to 2014) of field experiment in Hexi Corridor of Northwestern China. Four N management systems with N rate of 0 kg N ha(-1) (the control), 90 + 45 kg N ha(-1) (base N plus topdressing N), 90 + 90 kg N ha(-1), and 90 + 135 kg N ha(-1) were implemented in the maize/pea strip intercropping to form different ratios of base N to top-dressing N. Results Intercropped pea improved nodule biomass per plant by 99 %, increased nitrogen derived from the atmosphere (Ndfa) by 35 %, and promoted above-ground plant tissue N accumulation by 35 % as compared with sole pea, averaged across the four N treatments. Compared to the highest N fertilizer treatment, a reduction of topdressing to 45 kg N ha(-1) increased the nodule biomass of intercropped pea by 116 %, Ndfa by 35 %, and grain yield by 6 %. Conclusions Adaptation of suitable N management in cereal/legume intercropping systems will allow an effective conversion of atmospheric N-2 into crop available N and thus maximizing the system productivity.

Okra was sown at the end of July, in mid-August and early September as a late-season crop in 1999 and at the end of May, in early June and at the end of June as an early-season crop in 2000. It was sown at seed rates sufficient to achieve final population densities of 33 000 and 40000 plants/ha in late-season crops (1999) and early-season crops (2000), respectively. The late-season crops had shorter growth duration, received less rainfall, and experienced cooler temperatures during establishment and the early vegetative stage, and warmer temperatures during the reproductive phase than the early-season crops. Intercropping had no significant effect on the growth and tuber yields of cassava, or on phenology (i.e. time to vegetative growth, flowering and fruiting) and pod yield of okra in both seasons. However, it reduced weed growth by 35-57%, and kept both the soil and canopy environments of cassava cooler by 2(.)3-5(.)8 degreesC and more moist by 15-30 g/kg, compared with monoculture. The phenology and pod yields of the early- and late-season okra in both cropping systems were dependent on sowing date, indicating that okra production is only suitable at particular sowing dates in both seasons. July-sown okra in the 1999 late-season and May-sown crop in the 2000 early-season took progressively the longest time (i.e. 3-10 and 2-5 days, respectively) to flower and fruit, but these crops controlled weeds and modified the cassava environment better than the rest, and gave the highest fresh pod yields and economic returns. It took okra pods longer to reach marketable size in the late season than early season (i.e. 5-9 v. 2-6 days). It is concluded that the optimal sowing date to attain maximum pod yield and economic returns from late-season okra is July or August and from early-season crop is May or early June. Bearing in mind financial constraints and production costs, the optimal season target for maximum edible pods is the early season and for maximum economic returns is the late season.

"Lodging is the most important constraint for soybean growth at seedling stage in maize-soybean relay strip intercropping system. In the field experiments, three soybean cultivars Nandou 032-4 (shade susceptible cultivar; B1), Jiuyuehuang (moderately shade tolerant cultivar; B2), and Nandou 12 (shade tolerant cultivar; B3) were used to evaluate the relationship between stem stress and lignin metabolism in the stem of soybean. Results showed that the intercropped soybean was in variable light condition throughout the day time and co-growth stage with maize. The xylem area and cross section ratio played a main role to form the stem stress. The B3 both in intercropping and monocropping expressed a high stem stress with higher xylem area, lignin content, and activity of enzymes (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL), cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), and peroxidase (POD)) than those of B1 and B2. Among the soybean cultivars and planting pattern, lignin content was positively correlated with stem stress. However, a negative correlation was found between lignin content and actual rate of lodging. In conclusion, the shade tolerant soybean cultivar had larger xylem area, higher lignin content and activities of CAD, 4CL, PAL, and POD than other soybean cultivars in intercropping. The lodging in maize-soybean intercropping can be minimized by planting shade tolerant and lodging resistant cultivar of soybean. The lignin content in stem could be a useful indicator for the evaluation of lodging resistance of soybean in intercropping and activities of enzymes were the key factors that influence the lignin biosynthesis."

This study assessed the influence of sowing ratio and N fertilization on nitrogen uptake, use and utilization efficiency of oat (Avena sativa L.) and pea (Pisum sativum L.) in intercrops. A two-year field study was carried out in eastern Austria with oat and pea sown in three substitutive sowing ratios and at different nitrogen levels. Oat was the dominant partner in the mixtures strongly outcompeting pea. Total grain yields were generally lower in intercrops than in pure stands. Consequently, nitrogen use and the partial factor nitrogen use efficiency for grain production were lower in intercrops. Nitrogen utilization efficiency was highest in pure oat stands and decreased with higher pea shares. Grain N concentration of oat and pea increased with N fertilization. In intercrops, grain N concentrations of oat increased with lower oat share whereas those of pea were not affected by cropping system. Due to higher grain N concentrations of oat in intercrops, intercrops could attain a higher grain N yield in unfertilized treatments. Thus, growing oat-pea intercrops can be reasonable for producing grain feed at low N input level. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Contour hedgerows have been used as a major soil and water conservation measure in this area. Accordingly, a two-year study was conducted to investigate the effects of contour hedgerow intercropping on nutrient loss from sloping farmland in this area. Four treatments were applied: (1) Maize + Soybean, (2) Maize, (3) Maize + Alfalfa, and (4) Maize + Hemerocallis citrina Baroni. Results indicated that nutrient loss in the control treatment (Maize) was serious, especially the average loss flux of total nitrogen (2245.8 mg) and total phosphate (2434.2 mg) in a typical rainfall event. However, the nutrient losses by runoff in the other three treatments with contour hedgerow intercropping showed significant reduction. Compared with the control treatment, the total nitrogen loss in the Alfalfa and Hemerocallis citrina Baroni decreased by 80.9% and 85.0%, respectively, and the total phosphorus loss in the two treatments decreased by 91.2% and 92.5%, respectively. Therefore, it is concluded that nutrient losses could be reduced by using contour hedgerows in the Three Gorges Region. Reducing runoff volume and sediment loss was the main mechanisms of contour hedgerow intercropping to reduce nutrient loss.

Soil respiration in a triple intercropping system under conservation tillage	PLANT SOIL AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"triple cropping in dryland; wheat-maize-soybean; soil hydrothermic factor; soil animals"	FLUXES	Drivers of soil respiration (R-s) in farmland ecosystem have already been widely studied. However, the relationship between R-s and soil fauna (F-s), hydrothermic factor in the triple intercropping system remains poorly known. An LI-6400 XT portable photosynthesis measurement system equipped with a soil respiratory chamber was adopted in the experimental field. Straw mulching treatment increased soil respiration rate but ridge tillage treatment did not have a consistent effect. A regression analysis of the relationship revealed that exponential equation fitted well the relationship between R-s and soil temperature at 10 cm soil depth. However, the relationship between R-s and soil moisture was best confirmed by a parabolic function. The common dominant groups of F-s in wheat, corn, and soybean farmland were Collembola and Acarina, while Diptera emerged in the two rear crops farmlands. Compared to the control, ridge tillage reduced the number of F-s, but straw mulching increased it and improved the index of soil fauna diversity. In conclusion, the higher was the amount of animals being active above soil surface, the stronger was the soil respiration.	"[Zhang, S.; Wang, L.

Conservation Agriculture Improves Soil Quality, Crop Yield, and Incomes of Smallholder Farmers in North Western Ghana	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						"conservation agriculture; no-tillage; crop rotation; intercropping; residue retention; soil quality; crop yield; profitability"	"ZEA-MAYS L.; ORGANIC-CARBON; NO-TILL; MANAGEMENT; NITROGEN; SYSTEMS; ROTATION; RESIDUE; STORAGE; SEQUESTRATION"	Conservation agriculture (CA) practices are being widely promoted in many areas in sub-Saharan Africa to recuperate degraded soils and improve ecosystem services. This study examined the effects of three tillage practices [conventional moldboard plowing (CT), hand hoeing (MT) and no-tillage (NT)], and three cropping systems (continuous maize, soybean-maize annual rotation, and soybean/maize intercropping) on soil quality, crop productivity, and profitability in researcher and farmer managed on-farm trials from 2010 to 2013 in northwestern Ghana. In the researcher managed mother trial, the CA practices of NT, residue retention and crop rotation/intercropping maintained higher soil organic carbon, and total soil N compared to conventional tillage practices after 4 years. Soil bulk density was higher under NT than under CT soils in the researcher managed mother trails or farmers managed baby trials after 4 years. In the researcher managed mother trial, there was no significant difference between tillage systems or cropping systems in maize or soybean yields in the first three seasons. In the fourth season, crop rotation had the greatest impact on maize yields with CT maize following soybean increasing yields by 41 and 49% compared to MT and NT maize, respectively. In the farmers' managed trials, maize yield ranged from 520 to 2700 kg ha(-1) and 300 to 2000 kg ha(-1) for CT and NT, respectively, reflecting differences in experience of farmers with NT. Averaged across farmers, CT cropping systems increased maize and soybean yield ranging from 23 to 39% compared with NT cropping systems. Partial budget analysis showed that the cost of producing maize or soybean is 20-29% cheaper with NT systems and gives higher returns to labor compared to CT practice. Benefit-to-cost ratios also show that NT cropping systems are more profitable than CT systems. We conclude that with time, implementation of CA practices involving NT, crop rotation, intercropping of maize and soybean along with crop residue retention presents a win-win scenario due to improved crop yield, increased economic return, and trends of increasing soil fertility. The biggest challenge, however, remains with producing enough biomass and retaining same on the field.

This study was conducted (i) to determine the effect of row position on leaf area of corn (Zea mays L.) strip-intercropped with soybean [Glycine max (L.)

Corn, soybean, and small grain were planted in north-south rows on a mixed, mesic Typic Endoaquoll in Nepean, ON. There was 55.1 rainfall from emergence of Leaf 5 to silking in 1991 and 210.6 mm in 1992. Total green leaf area at grain filling varied with row position each year. The corn row next to the small grain had less leaf area than the middle row in 1991 and more leaf area than the middle row in 1992. These variable results were due to differences in weather in the two years. Dry conditions in 1991 resulted in slow expansion of leaves and in small individual leaf area. As thermal time to full expansion of the largest leaf on the plant was similar in both years, the largest leaf in 1991 occurred at an earlier developmental stage than in 1992 (Leaf 10.5 vs. Leaf 12). An existing leaf area model was found to fit the data, provided that adjustments for row position and for the timing of the development of the largest leaf were included."

J	"Stefan, L; Engbersen, N; Schob, C"				"Stefan, Laura; Engbersen, Nadine; Schob, Christian"			Using spatially-explicit plant competition models to optimise crop productivity in intercropped systems	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						"Row spacing; Plant-plant interactions; Intercropping; Competition; Crop yield; Spatially-explicit model; Facilitation"	"SPRING WHEAT; MEDITERRANEAN CONDITIONS; SPECIES COEXISTENCE; LEGUME INTERCROPS; GRAIN-YIELD; WHITE LUPIN; DENSITY; FACILITATION; GROWTH; ROW"	Intercropping, by capitalizing on positive biodiversity-productivity relationships, represents a promising option to increase agricultural sustainability. However, the complexity and context-dependency of plant-plant interactions can make it challenging for farmers to find suitable crop combinations. Furthermore, intercropping is usually implemented with standard inter-row spacing and plant densities based on monoculture practices, which might not be the ideal configuration to maximize yield. Here we present a spatially-explicit yield analysis method based on plant ecological interaction models that allowed to optimize crop species combinations and spatial configurations for maximal yield in intercropped systems. We tested this method with three crop species, namely oat, lupine, and camelina. In a first step, field experiments in which crop density and adjacent crop type were varied provided us with indications on which species would compete more with each other. The results showed us that oat and camelina strongly competed with each other. In addition, the distance experiments allowed us to understand how the changes in yield associated with the presence of neighbors vary with distance. This allowed us to find the sets of parameters (identity of neighbors, sowing density, distances between individuals) that optimise intercrop yield (measured as Land Equivalent Ratio [LER]) for the three considered species. Specifically, we show that alternating rows of species led to higher LERs than a homogeneous species mixing, and that 3-species combinations are not necessarily more performant than the best 2-species combinations. In addition, we show that increasing the density of oat is generally beneficial for LER, while increasing the density of lupine is not. By modelling crop yield from simple and reproducible density and distance experiments, our results allow to optimize crop mixtures in terms of species combinations and spatial configurations, for maximal crop yield.

Nodule numbers per plant range from 8 to 147, nodule mass from 89 to 306 mg per plant and coloured nodules from 72 to 84%. Recent studies reveal that the nitrogen contribution of A. hypogaea on the growth of Zea mays in intercropping systems is equivalent to an application of 96 kg N fertilizer per ha at a ratio of plant population densities of one maize plant: four groundnut plants. In addition, crop N yield is higher with M. pruriens (340 kg/ha) compared to C. cajan (114 kg/ha), followed by C. juncea (72 kg/ha) and A. hypogaea (39 kg/ha). The values of N contribution of legume genotypes as green manure on the grain yield,in maize crop are equivalent tb an application of 97 kg N-fertilizer/ha, 91 kg N-fertilizer/ha, 89 kg N-fertilizer/ha and 78 kg N-fertilizer/ha for M. pruriens, C. juncea, C. cajan, and A. hypogaea, respectively. There is evidence of nitrogen contribution of nodulated legumes on the growth of maize crop.

These tests were performed in meso-phylic conditions (35 degrees C) on previously chopped and ensiled biomass. The three crops have been cultivated in Southern Italy (Puglia region), both as single-crops and intercropping between triticale or barley and field bean, in different mixture combinations, during the season 2009-2010. Emphasis was placed on the determination of the chemical composition of feedstock from the three single species and their different intercropping ratios, mowed at two subsequent stages (milk and dough development of grasses), also assessing their consequent biogas and methane potential yields after silage. Seven overall treatments have been compared: the three species in monoculture (triticale, barley and field bean, respectively); two mixtures between triticale and field bean (with triticale at 70 and 50%, respectively); two mixtures between barley and field bean (again with barley at 70 and 50%, respectively). Immediately after cutting and for the next 90 days, biomass samples were closed into plastic mini-silos, each having a 5-L capacity, in order to simulate the silage process. Thereafter, the batch testing was performed and biogas and methane production have been determined, with respect to the main chemical characteristics of the chopped and ensiled biomass samples, able to affect biogas and methane yield. Considering the single-crop treatments the highest biogas per hectare production has been found with respect to triticale (8737.1 nm(3) ha(-1)) and barley (8837.6 nm(3) ha(-1)), at the first and second harvesting stage, respectively. Concerning grass-legume intercropping, the highest biogas yield (8635.0 nm(3) ha(-1)) was observed with reference to the 70:30 mixing ratio, specifically on barley mowed at the milk development stage. The methane content in the biogas ranged from 61.1% (on a 50:50 mixing ratio of barley at the milk stage) to 53.7% (on a barley monoculture at the dough stage)."

The study consisted of two trials which were planted separately at two locations representing different environmental conditions for two consecutive seasons. The design employed was the randomized complete block with three replications. Two polymorphic loci, glume pubescence and awn condition were utilized as markers. The rate of outcrossing was based on the number of hybrids found in the recessive class of each marker. The overall level of outcrossing was higher in the pure stand trial than in the mixed stand trial. A higher rate of outcrossing occurred in the higher altitude area in the pure stand trial while the opposite was the case in the mixed stand trial. The average rate of outcrossing due to the marker loci was also different, with the long awn displaying more outbreeding tendency. Both locational and seasonal differences in the amount of outcrossing were observed. Generally, the study has revealed that there is a considerable amount of outbreeding in the landraces and that this genetic factor could play a role in preserving Variation in the landrace populations. The level of outcrossing detected in this study could have a bearing on the maintenance of the genetic purity of diverse breeding lines being handled together in a breeding nursery and varietal purity in seed multiplication.

However, information on how MT regulates soybean growth under low-temperature (LT) stress is lacking. To better understand how MT promotes plant growth and development under LT stress, we designed this study to evaluate the role of MT pretreatment on soybean seedlings exposed to LT stress. Our results showed that LT stress increased oxidative damage by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, which affected the growth and development of soybean seedlings. However, the application of 5 mu mol L-1MT significantly decreased the oxidative damage by increasing plant mineral element concentrations and the transcript abundance of antioxidant related genes, which enhanced the decrease in ROS accumulation. These results collectively suggest the involvement of MT in improving LT stress tolerance of soybean seedlings by mediating plant mineral elements and the expression of genes involved in the antioxidant pathway.

The experiment was conducted on a Kanhaplic Haplustalf soil. Soybean was planted in drills between cassava rows after harvesting maize and melon. Soybean stover was recycled into half of the soybean plots. Cassava yield was reduced by about 16% with soybean intercropping without the residue incorporation and by about 11% with incorporation of the crop residue. Soil pH was significantly reduced from an initial 6.0 to 5.7 with soybean intercropping. Organic matter was drastically reduced from an initial 31.0 g kg(-1) to 5.3 g kg(-1) with sole cassava cropping, and to 10.1 g kg(-1) with soybean intercropping and incorporation of crop residue. Total nitrogen (N) was also significantly reduced to about 0.4 g kg(-1) from an initial content of 1.8 g kg(-1) , while the available phosphorus (P) was increased from 1.8 to an average of 4.0 mg kg(-1) .

Increasing population pressure coupled with the scarcity of suitable land for cultivation, have led to the reduction of traditional fallow periods by most farmers, with consequent land deterioration. A study is underway in Zambia to validate and adapt soil management techniques in order to arrive at fanning systems that yield sustained food production with minimum depletion of renewable and non-renewable resources, and thus reducing the need for shifting cultivation. The comparative efficacy of 1 year improved fallow systems using 3 different leguminous tree species planted in pure stands to improve soil fertility and intercropped with maize to improve household food security by adding economic value to the fallow is being evaluated. Significant differences (P<0.05) were observed in the branches of Leucaena diversifolia, Cajanus cajan and Cassia siamea as influenced by maize, while the establishment and growth of maize were not significantly affected by any of the trees L. diversifolia proved to be a better Nitrogen fixer compared to pigeon pea (C. cajan) and C. siamea Lowest soil mineral Nitrogen concentrations were recorded in plots of Cassia both in sole and intercropped plots. Significantly higher (P<0.05) maize grain yields were obtained in plots where maize was intercropped with L. diversifolia (6.73 t/ha) compared to the control (sole maize) which yielded 4.22 t/ha, while maize grown in association with C. cajan yielded lowest (2.33 t/ha). The economic value of planted fallows was increased by intercropping trees with maize during the first year.

However, cultivation of soils results in emission of other greenhouse gases (GHGs), especially nitrous oxide (N2O). Previous studies on biofuel production systems showed that emissions of N2O may counterbalance a substantial part of the global warming reduction, which is achieved by fossil fuel displacement. In this study, we related measured field emissions of N2O to the reduction in fossil fuel-derived CO2, which was obtained when agricultural biomasses were used for biofuel production. The analysis included five organically managed feedstocks (viz. dried straw of sole cropped rye, sole cropped vetch and intercropped ryevetch, as well as fresh grassclover and whole crop maize) and three scenarios for conversion of biomass into biofuel. The scenarios were (i) bioethanol, (ii) biogas and (iii) coproduction of bioethanol and biogas. In the last scenario, the biomass was first used for bioethanol fermentation and subsequently the effluent from this process was utilized for biogas production. The net GHG reduction was calculated as the avoided fossil fuel-derived CO2, where the N2O emission was subtracted. This value did not account for fossil fuel-derived CO2 emissions from farm machinery and during conversion processes that turn biomass into biofuel. The greatest net GHG reduction, corresponding to 700800 g CO2 m(-2), was obtained by biogas production or coproduction of bioethanol and biogas on either fresh grassclover or whole crop maize. In contrast, biofuel production based on lignocellulosic crop residues (i.e. rye and vetch straw) provided considerably lower net GHG reductions (=215 g CO2 m(-2)), and even negative numbers sometimes. No GHG benefit was achieved by fertilizing the maize crop because the extra crop yield, and thereby increased biofuel production, was offset by enhanced N2O emissions.

The objective of the study was to assess the effect of intercropping maize, Zea mays L., and leek on abundance of thrips and production and morphology of both crops, but emphasizing effects on leek. The experiment was done during spring 2016 in northwestern Mexico, under extreme climatic conditions characteristic of desert environments and high soil salinity. Two maize varieties (sweet and field) at zero, three, five, and 10 plants per square meter were intercropped with a fixed number of 10 leek plants per square meter. The response variables were thrips abundance and plant yields and morphology characteristics. Maize reduced abundance of thrips on leek, with 5.6, 2.6, 2.2, and 1.5 thrips for 0, 3, 5, and 10 maize plants m-2, respectively; i.e., the closer together the maize plants, the less abundant were thrips on leek, but leek yields were less with more maize plants (plant competition) per meter, with 12,075, 4,875, 4,581, and 4,159 kg ha(-1), respectively. Leeks intercropped showed morphological adjustments compared with a leek monoculture, indicating negative effects of competition with maize, instead of benefiting from the microenvironment (cooler leek canopy temperatures) created by maize. Maize was effective at reducing abundance of thrips but severely out-competed leeks. Further testing is needed on less competitive secondary crop species in main crops in a region to reduce pest abundance naturally without decreasing yield potential of associated crops."

The potential of intercroppingmaize (Zea mays) or sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) with watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) was tested in two on-farm trials in southern Mozambique under semi-arid conditions in an area with low and unpredictable rainfall. In the first experiment, plant density, yield and monetary value of sole and intercropping plots of maize with watermelon were determined in 17 farmers' fields in an area where all crops developed to maturity and harvest. There was a significant reduction in yield of both maize (28.8%) and watermelon (57.8%) in the intercrop compared with the sole crop yields. However, the mean land equivalent ratio of 1.13 for yield showed that intercropping had advantages as, on average, an area planted with sole crops would require 13% more land than an intercrop production to generate the same outcome. In the second experiment, carried out in another area with 16 farmers' fields, drought was more pronounced and only watermelon developed to maturity. Intercroppings with maize and sorghum resulted in 70% and 69% yield reduction, respectively. In conclusion, watermelon is a good companion crop for intercropping with cereals to mitigate the risk of total crop failure due to drought.	"[Jensen, B. D.; Andersen, S. B.; Christiansen, J.

The leaf's hormone concentrations, main-stem and branch yield response to the combination of shade and drought were studied in a greenhouse experiment during 2009 and 2010 seasons. Pot experiments were conducted under shade of maize (LI) and normal irradiance (HI). Shade stress was removed once maize was harvested. Manipulative progressive soil drying period at branching stages under good soil conditions (HW) and water stress treatment (LW) were applied in 2010, while well-watered (WW) and moderate drought (MD) were applied in 2009. Under shade stress, seedling height and first internode length increased, stem diameter decreased, abscisic acid (ABA) and zeatin (ZT) concentration decreased, while indole acetic acid (IAA) and gibberellins 3 (GA3) concentration increased. More also, branch numbers, pod number of branches and seed number of branches increased. Branch yield did not reduce significantly under shade stress, which was related to the decrease of ABA and IAA. Based on the results, soybean yield decreased under shade and drought stresses was mainly due to the yield reduction of the main-stem.

Few studies based on multiview photography have been conducted in a field environment, particularly studies that link 3-D plant architecture with a radiation model to quantify the dynamic canopy light interception. In this study, we combined realistic 3-D plant architecture with a radiation model to quantify and evaluate the effect of differences in planting patterns and row orientations on canopy light interception. Methods The 3-D architectures of maize and soybean plants were reconstructed for sole crops and intercrops based on multi-view images obtained at five growth dates in the field. We evaluated the accuracy of the calculated leaf length, maximum leaf width, plant height and leaf area according to the measured data. The light distribution within the 3-D plant canopy was calculated with a 3-D radiation model. Finally, we evaluated canopy light interception in different row orientations. Key Results There was good agreement between the measured and calculated phenotypic traits, with an R-2 >0.97. The light distribution was more uniform for intercropped maize and more concentrated for sole maize. At the maize silking stage, 85 % of radiation was intercepted by approx. 55 % of the upper canopy region for maize and by approx. 33 % of the upper canopy region for soybean. There was no significant difference in daily light interception between the different row orientations for the entire intercropping and sole systems. However, for intercropped maize, near east-west orientations showed approx. 19 % higher daily light interception than near south-north orientations. For intercropped soybean, daily light interception showed the opposite trend. It was approx. 49 % higher for near south-north orientations than for near east-west orientations. Conclusions The accurate reconstruction of 3-D plants grown in the field based on multi-view images provides the possibility for high-throughput 3-D phenotyping in the field and allows a better understanding of the relationship between canopy architecture and the light environment.

The roots can be reliably differentiated via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflection (FTIR-ATR). In two replicated greenhouse experiments, six pea cultivars, five oat cultivars as well as seven maize cultivars and five barnyard grass proveniences (n = 10 plants/cultivar or provenience) were grown under controlled conditions. One root of each plant was harvested and five different root segments of each root were separated, dried and measured with FTIR-ATR spectroscopy. The results showed that, firstly, the root spectra of single pea and single oat cultivars as well as single maize and single barnyard grass cultivars/proveniences separated species-specific in cluster analyses. In the majority of cases the species separation was correct, but in a few cases, the spectra of the root tips had to be omitted to ensure the precise separation between the species. Therefore, species differentiation is possible regardless of the cultivar or provenience. Consequently, all tested cultivars of pea and oat spectra were analyzed together and separated within a cluster analysis according to their affiliated species. The same result was found in a cluster analysis with maize and barnyard grass spectra. Secondly, a cluster analysis with all species (pea, oat, maize and barnyard grass) was performed. The species split up species-specific and formed a dicotyledonous pea cluster and a monocotyledonous cluster subdivided in oat, maize and barnyard grass subclusters. Thirdly, cultivar or provenience differentiations within one species were possible in one of the two replicated experiments. But these separations were less resilient.

Qualitative aspects and biomass production in oats and ryegrass pastures cultivated pure or intercropping and subjected to lenient grazing	ARQUIVO BRASILEIRO DE MEDICINA VETERINARIA E ZOOTECNIA			Portuguese	Article						"Avena strigosa Schreb; Lolium multiflorum Lam; leaf stem/ratio; accumulation rate"	"ITALIAN RYEGRASS; TILLER; COMPETITION; MIXTURE; PLANTS"	Mixed pastures of oats + annual ryegrass have been considered a good alternative for animal feeding during the winter/spring period in subtropical regions. However, the impacts of lenient grazing under their qualitative and productive aspects, when compared to their monoculture, remain unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the morphological and chemical composition and biomass production of black oat (Avena strigosa cv. IAPAR 61) and annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam cv. common) swards cultivated pure or intercropped, throughout the growing season and submitted to lenient grazing. Treatments (oats, annual ryegrass and intercropping oats + annual ryegrass) were arranged in a complete randomized block design with four replications. The pastures were defoliated in 40% of pre-grazing height by Holstein heifers, when the heights reached 17, 20 and 23cm for the ryegrass, intercrop and oat, respectively. The leaf blade: stem ratio decreased with the advance of the growing season for all treatments, but the proportion of stems in the grazed stratum remained lower than 20% of dry matter until the pastures begun reproductive development. Similarly, the crude protein (CP) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) levels in grazed stratum were, respectively, above 16% and below 50% from the first to fourth grazing cycles. Mixed pastures of black oat + ryegrass and ryegrass alone had higher forage accumulation rate (average = 32.6kg DM ha(-1) day(-1)), but mixed pastures were used for a longer period, resulting in a greatest total DM production (4809kg DM ha(-1)). Lenient grazing does not reduce the forage quality in potential grazing layer throughout the growing vegetative stage. Intercropping black oat and ryegrass increases total DM production when compared to their monocultures.	"[Guzatti, G. C.; Duchini, P. G.; Sbrissia, A. F.; Ribeiro-Filho, H. M.

Productivity of cassava and other crops in an intercropping system	CIENCIA E INVESTIGACION AGRARIA			English	Article						"Area equivalence index; harvest index; Manihot esculenta; policultivation systems"	"YIELD; MANAGEMENT; GROWTH; ROOTS"	Intercropping is a common practice among farmers in tropical regions of the world and has persisted for years, not only for traditional reasons, but also for certain advantages that helped in its ecological adaptation. In regard to low income farmers with small areas for cultivation, more attention should be given to the cost of production and better land management. Thus, the aim of this work was to determine the best intercropping system of cassava with other crops. The experiment was conducted in an area belonging to the cassava (Manihot esculenta) producers of the Planalto de Minas district in Diamantina, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The treatments comprised cassava intercropped with maize, beans and dwarf pigeon pea, as well as controls with and without weeding. The dry mass of shoots for maize, beans and dwarf-pigeon pea was affected by the presence of cassava. The productivity of cassava was dependent on cultivar and the intercropped crop. The highest harvest indexes were observed when cassava was intercropped with maize. In a general way, intercropping with maize and beans showed the highest area equivalence indexes and are recommended for the cassava crop.

Melon was planted in the same rows with yam. Maize was planted between rows of melon + yam. At 0.10 m depth, the soil was desiccated most under the intercrop compared with monocrops. The trend changed at 0.30 m depth where minimum soil water was under sole maize. At 0.01 m depth, maximum soil temperature in the intercrop was lower by 1-2-degrees, 8-10-degrees and 8-11-degrees-C in relation to monocultures of melon, yam and maize, respectively, depending on insolation load and soil moisture content. At 0.20 m depth, however, temperature differences between intercrop and monocrops were much smaller due to soil's damping effect. Intercropping decreased plant height and leaf area index of maize as compared to monocropping. Maize root length density in the 0-5 cm layer under the row was lower in the intercrop than sole crop, but in the 10-20 cm layer this was reversed. The intercrop of maize, melon and yam produced 61 and 98% more food than monocrops in 1987 and 1988, respectively, as assessed by area x time equivalent ratio.

The trials were carried out at Embrapa-Centro Nacional de Pesquisa de Milho a Sorgo (CNPMS), Minas Gerais State, Brazil, in 1988/89 and 1989/90. The maize cultivars BR 201, Cargill 606 and CMS 350 were sowed in double rows with 50 cm within the pair of double rows, and 150 cm between the pair of double rows at 40.000 and 60,000 plants per hectare. The check was 100 cm single row with 40,000 plants per hectare. Planting density of common beans was 120,000 plants per hectare, which was constant in the systems. Differences were not observed for maize yield between planting systems. Common bean yield decreased when intercropped with maize Cargill 606 and CMS 350 in double lines. The hybrid Cargill 606 in single line increased the yield of the legume. The cultivar BR 201 was the most efficient for intercropping because of higher grain yield average and also because it allowed good average yields of common beans. The planting systems and the climate exerted influence on the grain yields.

Mixing wheat cultivars and intercropping winter wheat and white clover are both promising agroecological practices. On field experiments over two growing seasons, we combined both practices and examined the impact on aphid populations and on wheat production. Results show that combining intra- and interspecific diversity did not outperform each practice individually in reducing aphid populations. Taken separately, intercropping tended to have lower aphid infestation, while it was intermediate in cultivar mixtures. Yearly variation in climatic conditions impacted wheat and clover development, as well as the appearance of aphid peaks. Wheat yields and grain nitrogen content were reduced in intercropping by 10% and 7%, respectively, but not in cultivar mixtures. Our findings suggest that intrafield diversification may regulate wheat aphids to some extent, but combining two diversification practices did not result in an attractive trade-off between pest regulation and wheat production in real farming conditions.

Under semi-arid desert conditions, intercropping of leucaena and sesbania with some annual grasses (barley, pearl millet, and Rhodes-, rye- and sudan-grasses) was evaluated in a series of field trials. Inocula of specific rhizobia for legumes and a composite of associative diazotrophs for non-legumes were applied in the presence or absence of N fertilizers. Rhizobia inoculation was indispensable, and supported better growth of legumes which extended to the neighboring non-legumes. Associative diazotrophs improved biomass and N yields of non-legumes, particularly in the presence of moderate N fertilization for winter barley and rye grass and of higher doses of 300 kg N.ha(-1) for summer pearl millet and sudan grass. Intercropping improved productivity of non-legumes, in particular barley mixed with sesbania, and the calculated N-transfer from legumes to non-legumes ranged from 20 to 70 kg N.ha(-1).

Grain legumes for soil productivity improvement in the Northern Guinea savanna of Nigeria	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"Soil restoration; soil moisture conservation; sustainable crop and livestock production; sustainable soil management"		The Nigerian savanna zone is currently witnessing increasing intensities of crop and livestock production activities that are resulting in increased soil erosion, de-vegetation of the land area, and desert encroachment especially during the dry season. These may have led to the presence of several over-grazed and bare ground areas that is highly susceptible to soil erosion. At harvest, both crop and residues are removed from the field, thus limiting potential nutrient recycling between crop and soil, and further impoverishing the nutrient status of the soils. The Nigerian savanna zone soils therefore have low total nitrogen, organic carbon, available phosphorus and cation exchange capacity. They also have very poor moisture holding capacity, and are therefore said to have poor fertility status and very low buffering capacity. The present study aimed to determine effects of grain legumes on soil potential in the arid systems was therefore imposed on the soils in the Zaria area. Results show that sole legumes and legume/maize treatments generally resulted in higher organic carbon contribution than sole maize treatment, suggesting that sole maize grown continuously on one farm for years could degrade the organic carbon content of the soil. Also, the sole legume and legume/maize treatments resulted in improvements in soil nitrogen in the range between 65.6 and 84.8 %, while nitrogen under sole maize resulted in only 5.9 % increase. In 2001, groundnut/maize intercrop resulted in significantly higher maize grain yield (1.49 t ha(-1)) than the other treatments. Comparing between maize grain yields in 2001 and 2002, maize grain improved by 20.1% under sole maize, 95.0% under maize in sole groundnut, 92.8% under maize in soybean, and 98.4% under maize in cowpea. This would confirm that the sole legume planting for two years restored fertility status of the soils and enhanced the soil organic carbon and total nitrogen, to have resulted in greater maize grain yield than under the sole maize despite the 120 kg N fertilizer applied to the sole maize.

Mixture rates were formulated using three combinations of common vetch-cereal (75:25, 50:50 and 25:75) under rain fed conditions in the southern Marmara Region, Turkey, during the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 growing seasons. The field trials were arranged in a randomized block design with three replications. The averages of the two-year findings indicated that the highest dry matter was determined at pure oat stands, followed by common vetch-oat mixtures at ratios of 50:50 and 75:25. The highest crude protein yield was obtained from pure common vetch and common vetch-oat (75:25) stands. A common vetch-oat mixture at 75:25 can be recommended for experimental and similar ecologies because of its higher dry matter and crude protein yields.

Here, we focus on intercropping and how this agroecological practice can be used to increase the sustainability of crop production. Strip, mixed, and relay intercropping can be used to increase crop yields through resource partitioning and facilitation. In addition to achieving greater productivity, diversifying cropping systems through the use of strategic intercrops can increase yield stability, reduce pests, and improve soil health. Several intercropping systems are already implemented in industrialized agricultural landscapes, including mixed intercropping with perennial grasses and legumes as forage and relay intercropping with winter wheat and red clover. Because intercropping can provide numerous benefits, researchers should be clear about their objectives and use appropriate methods so as to not draw spurious conclusions when studying intercrops. In order to advance the practice, experiments that test the effects of intercropping should use standardized methodology, and researchers should report a set of common criteria to facilitate cross-study comparisons. Intercropping with two or more crops appears to be less common with annuals than perennials, which is likely due to differences in the mechanisms responsible for complementarity. One area where intercropping with annuals in industrialized agricultural landscapes has advanced is with cover crops, where private, public, and governmental organizations have harmonized efforts to increase the adoption of cover crop mixtures.

J	"Xin, Y; Tao, FL"				"Xin, Yue; Tao, Fulu"			Developing climate-smart agricultural systems in the North China Plain	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"Climate change; Climate adaptation and mitigation; Conservation tillage; Greenhouse gas emission; Nitrogen leaching; Soil organic carbon"	"NITROGEN USE EFFICIENCY; MAIZE CROPPING SYSTEM; WINTER-WHEAT YIELD; NO-TILLAGE; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; RESIDUAL NITRATE; CEREAL SYSTEMS; ECO-EFFICIENCY; SOIL; MANAGEMENT"	Developing climate-smart agricultural systems is essential for climate change adaptation and mitigation. In the past decades, the typical winter wheat- summer maize rotation system in the North China Plain (NCP) has produced high yield, but the overuse of nitrogen fertilizer and over-pumping of groundwater for irrigation have caused severe environmental problems. It is necessary to develop climate-smart agricultural systems through a comprehensive multiple-objective assessment and optimization of alternative cropping systems and agronomic managements. Here, with the agricultural system model of APSIM, eight alternative cropping systems at four typical sites across the NCP under two climate change scenarios and two tillage managements were comprehensively evaluated in terms of crop yield, water use efficiency (WUE), nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), evapotranspiration (ET), groundwater recharge (GWR), N2O emission, N leaching, surface soil organic carbon (SOC), and carbon footprint (CF). The results showed that under both baseline and future climate scenarios, the currently dominant winter wheat- summer maize rotation system had the largest ET, N leaching and N2O emission, a medium crop yield, WUE, and SOC, however a low NUE, and GWR. The rotation/intercropping systems could have higher grain yields, while the monoculture cropping systems could have advantage on water conservation. Maize had relatively higher yield, WUE, NUE, GWR, and SOC, and lower N loss and CF than wheat and soybean because it could have a high yield without irrigation. The optimized winter wheat-summer maize rotation system, with the optimal irrigation, fertilizer and cultivar, had the greatest advantage over other seven systems with the highest yields, WUE, NUE, high ET, GWR, and SOC, and the lowest N losses and CF. Compared with conventional tillage, each cropping system would have a little bit less negative response to future climate change with conservation tillage. The study demonstrated a useful framework to develop climate-smart agricultural systems and sustainable agricultural strategies to meet the challenges of global climate change, which can be widely applied to other cropping systems and regions.

Thus, we conducted a 4-yr field experiment in north-eastern China including continuous maize (CM), continuous soybean (CS), maize and soybean rotation (M-S), and maize and soybean intercropping (M/S) to evaluate the crop productivity, economic returns, carbon foot-print (CF) and carbon sustainability index (CSI) among the cropping system regimes. Compared with CM treatment, M-S and M/S achieved lower energy yield (EY) and maize equivalent economic yield (MEEY), but higher economic returns. The mean annual net revenue of M-S treatment was 7.2% higher, and the mean annual benefit: cost ratio of M-S and M/S treatments were 12.0% and 8.8% higher than those of CM treatment. Based on the life cycle assessment (LCA), lower CFs were observed in the M-S and M/S systems. The CF per unit of area (CFA) of M-S and M/S treatments was 21.4% and 51.3% lower than that of the CM treatment, respectively. The CF per kg of energy yield (CFEY) of M/S treatment was 35.4% lower, compared with that of the CM treatment. The CF per kg of maize equivalent economic yield (CFMEEY) under M/S treatment was 44.0% lower, than that of the CM treatment. Moreover, CF per unit of economic output (CFE) of M/S treatment was 45.0% lower than that of the CM treatment. The highest CSI was observed in M-S treatment, and it was 61.4% higher than that of CM treatment. Our findings indicate that diversified crop practice (e.g. maize-soybean intercropping and rotation systems) could achieve lesser carbon footprint and higher profitability, however, might compromise grain or energy yield.

For this purpose oat was intercropped with barley and canola under seeding ratios of 75:25, 50:50 and 25:75% for oat: barley/canola along with sole crops. Harvesting was done at the time of 50% heading of oat. Results revealed that sole oat produced maximum dry matter yield during both the years. None of the mixtures over yielded the respective sole crop, however the oat: barley mixture at 75:25% and oat: canola mixture at seeding ratio of 50:50% were similar to sole oat. Canola alone produced the highest crude protein (CP) yield, lowest neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) contents. Oat mixtures with canola have higher values for relative forage values (RFV) of the forage suggesting their better quality over oat: barley mixture. Therefore, it is suggested that to have higher dry matter yield of better quality from oat: canola mixture, ratio should be 50:50 and if oat is to mix with barley ratio should be 75:25%.

Biodiversity can support a greener revolution in Africa	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						"ecosystem services; nitrogen; rural development; sustainable agriculture"	"SMALLHOLDER FARMS; SOIL FERTILITY; MALAWI; MAIZE"	The Asian green revolution trebled grain yields through agro-chemical intensification of monocultures. Associated environmental costs have subsequently emerged. A rapidly changing world necessitates sustainability principles be developed to reinvent these technologies and test them at scale. The need is particularly urgent in Africa, where ecosystems are degrading and crop yields have stagnated. An unprecedented opportunity to reverse this trend is unfolding in Malawi, where a 90% subsidy has ensured access to fertilization and improved maize seed, with substantive gains in productivity for millions of farmers. To test if economic and ecological sustainability could be improved, we preformed manipulative experimentation with crop diversity in a countrywide trial (n = 991) and at adaptive, local scales through a decade of participatory research (n = 146). Spatial and temporal treatments compared monoculture maize with legume-diversified maize that included annual and semiperennial (SP) growth habits in temporal and spatial combinations, including rotation, SP rotation, intercrop, and SP intercrop systems. Modest fertilizer intensification doubled grain yield compared with monoculture maize. Biodiversity improved ecosystem function further: SP rotation systems at half-fertilizer rates produced equivalent quantities of grain, on a more stable basis (yield variability reduced from 22% to 13%) compared with monoculture. Across sites, profitability and farmer preference matched: SP rotations provided twofold superior returns, whereas diversification of maize with annual legumes provided more modest returns. In this study, we provide evidence that in Africa, crop diversification can be effective at a countrywide scale, and that shrubby, grain legumes can enhance environmental and food security.

To assess the yield performances of these cropping systems, an experiment was set up in 2003 at Andranomanelatra (1640m asl) in the Malagasy highlands. Grain yield, yield components, biomass accumulation and nitrogen uptake of upland rice were analyzed in the 2004-2005, 2006-2006, and 2006-2007 seasons, and root length density was measured in the 2007-2008 season. The rice crop was planted every second year following two different crops: maize intercropped with soybean (M + S. with both conventional tillage and no tillage) and maize intercropped with Brachiaria ruziziensis (M + B only with no tillage). For each cropping system, two levels of fertilization were used: no fertilizer or application of organic inputs and mineral fertilizer. The season, cropping system, and fertilization treatment had significant effects on rice grain yields. Higher yields were associated with a greater number of plants per m(2), which decreased significantly over the three seasons, probably due to the highly variable beginning of the rains, and in the final season, with attacks by soil insects. The rice yield with conventional tillage was the highest and differed significantly from rice yield when maize was intercropped with Brachiaria under the no-till system, but not when the maize was intercropped with soybean with no tillage. In all three seasons, grain yields were closely linked to crop N at harvest. Differences in N uptake between treatments appeared very early in the crop cycle. Under conventional tillage, root length density at 68 days after sowing was higher between 0 and 30 cm depth than with no tillage. In these cold highlands conditions, plant establishment appeared to be more difficult with no tillage and resulted in reduced plant development and plant N uptake, particularly when rice was planted after maize intercropped with Brachiaria.

Oerst.; white oaks; allele sharing; differentiation; gene admixture"	"RECURRENT GENE FLOW; NATURAL HYBRIDIZATION; HYBRID ZONES; PETRAEA; DIFFERENTIATION; POPULATIONS; FAGACEAE; FITNESS; ROBUR; COMPLEX"	European white oak species (Quercus subg. Lepidobalanus) are known to share a substantial part of the nuclear and cytoplasmic genome. In spite of this fact, they have preserved their integrity. We analyzed genetic variation at thirteen isozyme loci in nine Quercus robur, ten Q. petraea, two Q. pubescens and two mixed (two-species) populations in Slovakia to assess the extent of allele sharing. Moreover, a detailed morphometric study based on thirteen leaf traits was done in the mixed stands. A Bayesian analysis of population structure in the set of pure populations revealed the existence of three clusters, which coincided with the supposed taxonomical identity of populations. However, the distribution of posterior probabilities of data was bimodal with a second peak at six groups, what indicates a possible substructure in the gene pools of the investigated oak species. Moreover, gene admixture was close to 50% in all investigated populations. Morphometric analysis of the two mixed stands revealed a clear morphological separation of the studied oak species, sharply contrasting with a high degree of gene admixture. Differentiation is not uniformly distributed over the genome. High levels of differentiation (F-ST > 0.10) were observed at only three out of thirteen loci. The hypotheses explaining extensive allele sharing (shared ancestral polymorphisms vs. high levels of interspecific gene flow) are briefly discussed.

Two factor split plot experiment design was used. The main factor was intercropping density (A), with four levels: A(0), A(1), A(2), A(3). In which A(0) referred to control with only corn. A(1) was two lines corn with one line kudzu, which means corn: kudzu =2:1. A(2), referred to two lines corn with two lines kudzu, which was kudzu: corn= 2:2. A(3) was two lines corn with three lines of kudzu, which meant the ratio between kudzu and corn was 2:3. The vice factor was nitrogen utilization level (B), also with four levels: B-0, B-1, B-2, B-3. B-0 meant no nitrogen utilization (0 kg/hm(2)). B-1 referred to the nitrogen level at 50 kg/hm(2); B-2 was 100 kg/hm(2) and B-3 was 200 kg/hm(2). Corn was sowed in April and July separately in kudzu vine field. Two forages were harvested together when the corn was at the milk stage. After that, we measured the yield of the forages and then mixed the samples uniformly in each treatment. The mixed samples were chopped up and made into silage using the bag storage method for 60 days and then the silage quality was estimated by nutrition analysis including crude protein, crude fiber, ashes, fat and pH value. The results showed that, intercropping ratio of kudzu vine and corn was the main factor that influenced the system yield and nutrient content. The influence of nitrogen fertilizer declined as the kudzu vine grew. Intercropping density A(1), nitrogen application level B-1 or B-2 can get the highest nutrient yield, at the same time decrease nitrogen input.

The objective of this study was to apply the Century model to evaluate temporal SOC dynamics in two temperate intercrop systems [1:2 (one row of maize and two rows of soybeans); 2:3 intercrop (two rows of maize and three rows of soybean)] and in a maize and soybean sole crop. Upon initiation of intercropping, SOC increased by 47% after approximate to 100 years, whereas SOC in the maize sole crop increased by 21% and 2% in the soybean sole crop. The quantity of crop residue input was sufficient to increase the active (turnover time of months to years) SOC fraction in the intercrops and the maize sole crop, but not in the soybean sole crop. The slow fraction, with a turnover time of 20 to 50 years, increased in all crop systems and was the major driver of SOC accumulation. A 3 to 15% loss of SOC from the passive fraction, with a turnover time of 400 to 2000 years, in all crop systems showed the long-term impact of land-use conversion from historically undisturbed native grasslands to intensive agricultural production systems. This study provided an example of the potential of process-based models like Century to illustrate possible effects of cereal-legume intercropping on SOC dynamics and that the model was able to predict SOC stocks within -7 to +4% of measured values. We conclude, however that further fine-tuning of the model for application to cereal-legume intercrop systems is required in order to strengthen the relationship between measured and simulated values."

Here, a study was undertaken to evaluate the role of different wheat-pea intercropping patterns in conserving arthropod natural enemies and suppressing cereal aphids in agroecosystems. Wheat-pea intercropping in an 8-2 row pattern of wheat and pea, respectively, preserved and augmented natural enemies more than a monoculture of wheat. The highest abundance of ladybeetles in 2008 and 2009 occurred in the 8-2 row pattern, whereas the highest densities of aphid parasitoids were found in the 4-2 row pattern in 2008 and the 8-2 row pattern in 2009. The distribution of aphid populations in the peak stage was spatially heterogeneous, and the highest density of aphids was shown visually in wheat monoculture fields. The land equivalent ratio of 1.121:1.187 for wheat-pea intercropping in 2008 and 1.114:1.174 for wheat-pea intercropping in 2009 showed that intercropping of wheat and pea has potential to improve the utilization of plant growth resources as compared to sole crops. Wheat-pea intercropping has potential to control English grain aphids effectively by enhancing the abundance of natural enemies, especially with an 8-2 row pattern of wheat-pea, respectively.

Several agronomic practices have been promoted to improve soil fertility and crop productivity in Western Kenya. Yet, despite their benefits, a dearth of knowledge exists on their long-term effects on soil microbial biomass and phosphorus solubilizing microbial species (PSMs) abundance especially in this region. In a long-term (15 years) agronomic field trial, we selected 8 treatments that allowed for evaluation of 1) Effect of tillage in a maize-soybean rotation with fertilization and residue retention; 2) Effect of residue retention in a maize-soybean rotation with fertilization under conservation tillage; 3) Effect of N and P fertilization in a maize-soybean rotation with conventional tillage; 4) Effect of liming in a maize-soybean intercropping with conventional tillage; and 5) Effect of maize-soybean rotation versus intercropping under conservation tillage on microbial biomass and PSMs abundance. The study was conducted in a long-term conservation agriculture experiment (30 seasons) in a Ferralsol in Western Kenya in 2016 and 2017. Reduced tillage significantly (P < 0.05) increased microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP) and abundance of different PSMs relative to conventional tillage, though the results were not consistent for some species. Residue addition significantly increased MBP and abundance of different PSMs compared to systems without residue addition. Liming significantly reduced PSMs abundance in 2016, though this was inconsistent for 2017. In 2017, no effect of liming on soil pH was found. Fertiliser addition significantly increased PSMs abundance in 2016, but this was also inconsistent for 2017. Some PSMs strains were significantly more abundant in maize and soybean intercropping system compared to rotation, and vice versa. Our study demonstrated that not only the agronomic inputs applied but also tillage and cropping systems employed can variably affect the soil microbial populations."

A review	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Review						"intercropping; biofortification; iron and zinc; dicots; gramineous species"	"MUGINEIC ACID; NUTRITIONAL QUALITY; HUMAN-NEEDS; TRANSPORTER; FE; ACQUISITION; PHYTOSIDEROPHORES; RHIZOSPHERE; WHEAT; HOMEOSTASIS"	The lack of micronutrients such as iron and zinc is a widespread nutrition and health problem in developing countries. Biofortification is the process of enriching the nutrient content of staple crops. Biofortification provides a sustainable solution to iron and zinc deficiency in food around the world. Reports have highlighted the current strategies for the biofortification of crops, including mineral fertilization, conventional breeding and transgenic approaches. Any approach which could increase root growth and result in a high transfer of Fe and Zn from the soil to the plant is crucial for biofortification. In addition to these approaches, we draw attention to another important aspect of Fe and Zn biofortification: intercropping between dicots and gramineous species. Intercropping, in which at least two crop species are grown on the same plot of land simultaneously, can improve utilization of resources while significantly enhancing crop productivity, whereas monocropping is a traditional cropping system of only one crop growth. Monocropping has maintained crop productivity through heavy chemical inputs including the application of fertilizers and pesticides. Monocropping has therefore resulted in substantial eutrophication, environmental pollution, a food security crisis and economic burdens on farmers. Monocropping has also reduced the plant and microorganism diversity in the ecosystem. Compared with monocropped plants, intercropped plants can use nutrients, water and light better due to the spatial and temporal differences in the growth factors and a variety of species-specific mechanisms of physiological response to environmental stress. Intercropping is common in developing countries such as China, India, Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa. In particular, interspecific interaction facilitates the iron and zinc nutrition of intercropping systems such as peanut/maize, wheat/chickpea and guava/sorghum or maize. Intercropping also increases iron and zinc content in the seeds. In a peanut/maize case study, the Fe concentrations in peanut shoots and seed were 1.47-2.28 and 1.43 times higher than those of peanut in monocropping, respectively. In intercropping of chickpea and wheat, the Fe contents in wheat and chickpea seed were increased 1.26 and 1.21 times, respectively, and Zn concentration in chickpea seed was 2.82 times higher than that in monocropping. In this review, we focus on exemplary cases of dicot/gramineous species intercropping that result in improved iron and zinc nutrition of the plants. We present the current understanding of the mechanisms of improvement of iron and zinc in intercropping. The available literature shows that a reasonable intercropping system of nutrient-efficient species could prevent or mitigate iron and zinc deficiency of plants. Here, we propose that intercropping can potentially offer an effective and sustainable pathway to iron and zinc biofortification.

Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) as a bean intercrop or rotation crop contributes to the survival of bean root rot pathogens and perpetuation of bean root rots	PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						"Fusarium; incidence; intercropping; management; Pythium; severity"	"FUSARIUM; PYTHIUM"	Root rots (RR) are the main cause of declining bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) production in southwestern Uganda. Here, beans are mainly intercropped/rotated with maize (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) and garden peas (Pisum sativum). These crops also suffer from RR and bean RR pathogens have been isolated from some of these crops. This study aimed to determine the extent of RR on maize, sorghum and peas, and their potential to contribute to the survival of bean RR pathogens. Therefore, experiments were carried out in bean RR-infested farmers' fields as well as soils inoculated with bean RR pathogens (Pythium spp. and Fusarium spp.) under screen house conditions and a susceptible bean cultivar served as a control. High RR incidence/severity scores were recorded in beans and sorghum in both farmers' fields and screen house experiments. The high field RR incidence/severity in sorghum correlated with the screen house scores. This study shows that RR is also a problem to other crops, especially sorghum, warranting attention. The findings also imply that sorghum plays a potential role as an alternate host to bean RR pathogens, increasing inoculum density of bean RR pathogens and potentially negatively impacting the bean RR problem. Intercropping or rotating beans with sorghum in this region is not recommended. However, maize was RR-resistant and therefore appropriate as an intercrop/rotational crop to beans in the system. A holistic rather than commodity approach is recommended for managing RR in this cropping system.

The results obtained were as follows: 1) The yield of cassava planted in monoculture decreased from year to year without fertilizer application. In contrast, with fertilization, the yield was high and constant. The yield of cassava depended on the growth duration of cassava, The yield of upland rice and maize in monoculture was 2 to 4 times higher than that of intercropped upland rice and maize. 2) Cassava cultivation with intercropping of upland rice and maize as the first intercrop followed by peanut or soybean as the second intercrop or sequential cropping pattern of maize-maize performed well from the view points of yield and production of calorie and protein. 3) The amount of eroded soil during the first 4-month period in the rainy season was about 90% of the annual amount. Cassava cultivation with intercropping of upland rice and maize as the first intercrop reduced the amount of soil erosion. Soil erosion decreased appreciably from year to year. 4) Cassava intercropped with upland rice and maize followed by peanut or soybean was suitable from the view points of crop yield and maintenance of soil fertility in upland areas with Red-yellow Podzolic soil.

The effects of fungal endophytes on the feeding of the mealybug, Phenococcus solani Ferris (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae), and barley aphid, Sipha maydis Passerini (Homoptera: Aphididae), on tall fescue, Festuca arundinacea Schreb. and meadow fescue, Festuca pratensis Huds., were studied under greenhouse conditions. Mealybugs preferred endophyte-free (E-) clones over their endophyte-infected (E+) counterparts. E+ plants had a significantly lower number of mealybugs than E- plants. A mixture of E+ and E- plants supported intermediate mealybug numbers, between pure plantings of E+ and E- grasses. Barley aphids released on to plant materials were deterred from feeding and could not persist on E+ plants. E- plants did not survive because of aphid damage, while E+ plants generally re-grew, but were damaged to some degree. The results showed that the use of pure stands of endophyte-infected grasses or a mixed stand of infected and non-infected plants may increase the persistence and durability of turf and forage grass species in the presence of foliar damaging insects.

This study was conducted to evaluate the biomass and crude protein production as well as the soil water balance and water use efficiency of oat (Avena sativa L.) and common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) intercrops compared to sole crops. Field experiments were conducted during the fallow season after wheat harvesting (mid-July to late October) in 2011 and 2012. Five cropping patterns were tested: sole oat (SO), sole common vetch (SV), and three intercrops of oat to common vetch in rows of two to one (I21), one to one (I11), and one to two (I12). Rainfall in the middle and late growing season in 2011 was abundant, but the early season was very dry. Rainfall in 2012 was less than average but distributed similarly with the long-term pattern. When harvested in late September, I21 showed the greatest aerial biomass and crude protein yield of 3.20 and 0.36 t ha(-1), respectively, in 2011, and SO showed the greatest biomass and crude protein yield of 5.70 and 0.51 t ha(-1), respectively, in 2012. When harvested one month later, the crude protein content of common vetch maintained a large value, while that in oat was reduced by 21 %-29 %. I21 still showed the greatest biomass and crude protein yield in 2011, and in 2012, SO had the highest biomass yield of 7.74 t ha(-1) while SV showed the highest crude protein production of 0.65 t ha(-1). The land equivalent ratio was above unity in all intercropping systems in 2011 and below unity in all systems in 2012. The soil water in the 0-120 cm layer in all treatments was fully recharged in 2011, but depleted in 2012, and the depletions in SV and I12 were significantly less than that of the other treatments (P < 0.05) on both harvesting dates. In 2011, water use efficiencies based on biomass and crude protein on both harvesting dates were all greatest in I21, water use efficiencies at the early and late harvestings were greatest in SO and I12, respectively. Therefore, the intercrops with a greater oat proportion had the advantage of maintaining system production when early season water availability was unfavorable, while those with a greater common vetch proportion had the potential of improving forage quality and conserving soil water to maintain the production of the main crop under normal water conditions. Selection of a proper planting pattern should take initial soil water conditions and rainfall availability into consideration.

Optimizing Yield and Quality of Silage and Hay for Pea-Barley Mixtures Ratio under Irrigated Arid Environments	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						"forage mixture; silage quality; hay nutritive value; intercropping; nutrition qulaity; yield"	"HERBAGE YIELD; FORAGE YIELD; OAT; PERFORMANCE; SORGHUM; L.; SYSTEMS"	The changing climate, water scarcity, reduction in the land area under forage crops, expanding ruminant population, burgeoning demands for milk and meat production and food security concerns all insist on a necessary increase in forage production and quality. Cereal-legume mixed intercropping offers a biologically superior option to boost herbage yield and quality of preserved fodder (hay and silage), provided that rationalization of the component crop's proportional ratio is performed. Therefore, the current study was conducted to determine the forage yield and quality of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and pea (Pisum sativum L.) mixtures at the ratios 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75 and 0:100. The experiment was laid out in the regular arrangement of a randomized complete block design with three replicates. The results exhibited that forage quality was significantly affected by the mixture ratio. There was a significant improvement in protein, fiber rate and digestibility from the mixture. The ratios of barley and pea with 50:50 and 25:75 produced the maximum productivity and the best quality of forage. Regarding forage preservation, silage recorded higher contents of crude protein, ash and lower fiber contents than hay. Among seed mixtures, 0:100 ratio of barley-pea yielded the highest quality of silage with the maximum crude protein, ash and digestibility with lowest fiber contents.

Two experiments were carried out at each of two sites in both 1993 and 1994. The first experiment investigated the effects of seeding soybean or lupin alone or in combination with one of three forages (annual ryegrass, Lolium multiflorum Lam.; perennial ryegrass, Lolium perenne L.; and red clover, Trifolium pratense L.) on weed control. The second experiment examined the effects of seeding date (simultaneous with corn or 3 weeks later) and number of rows of large-seeded legumes (one or two) seeded between the corn rows, on weed control. Whenever seeding of legumes/forages was delayed, weekly interrow tillage operations were used to control weeds until legume/forage seeding. The density and biomasses of monocot weeds, either on or between the corn rows, were not affected by cultivation or intercropping. The density and biomass of dicot weeds on corn rows were reduced by some intercrop systems. For the various cropping systems tested, the dicot weed biomass and density between corn rows were most affected (in some cases reduced by 73-100% of the weedy control). A more effective dicot weed control was observed in delay seeded treatments, which allowed extra interrow cultivations. Intercrops that included soybean were also more successful at reducing weed populations than those containing lupin. Underseeded forages did not reduce weed biomass or density.

The investigation was carried out during the 1990's two cropping seasons at Abomey-Calavi in South-Benin. The results showed that the practice of intercropping cassava with maize, cowpea and peanut markedly reduced the population size of whitefly and, consequently, the incidence of disease development in the cassava crop. This reduction both in population size and disease incidence was considered to be an effect of the planting density, diversity as well as the feeding behaviour of the whitefly. The lowest whitefly populations were observed on the cassava plants in intercropping with cowpea and the lowest disease incidence was assessed in the cassava crop associated with cowpea and peanut.

Crop production intensification is required to produce more food per unit area of land, while rebuilding soil fertility. We explored the impact of reallocation of limited resources on crop productivity across farms of different resource endowment in central Mozambique. The results suggested that decreasing the cropped area and concentrating resources (fertiliser, manure and labour within the farmers' means) to smaller fields can increase total farm maize production for poor as well as relatively richer farmers in central Mozambique, but that the fertility of the retained and abandoned land is important for the overall outcome. Concentrating resources to smaller areas would in most cases also lead to increased concentrations of soil organic carbon (SOC), indicating positive effects on soil fertility and crop productivity in the long term. However, this apparently does not apply when only fertiliser is used and if harvest residues and weeds are removed or burnt. Organic inputs are thus also required, such as retention of crop residues, and applications of manure if available can further increase SOC. The study has revealed that sustainable intensification or crop production requires that multiple constraints be addressed simultaneously. Success of crop intensification options will also depend on proper targeting to different farm types as well as variability in soil fertility. Differences in resource ownership and biophysical circumstances lead to different opportunities for individual farmers even within the same area. While targeted interventions for individual farmers might not be feasible, targeting defined farmer/endowment groups may be a sustainable pathway to increase productivity. Although smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have limited assets, the study revealed opportunities to increase crop productivity without substantial capital inputs, but more efficient use and targeting.

Grain legumes and especially lupins are known to be poor competitors against weeds. Grain legumes are known to have low mineral soil N uptake abilities. However, inter-and intraspecific differences in N uptake ability in relation to below-ground traits have received little attention. Our objectives were (i) to measure differences among lupins for a set of traits associated with early growth and N acquisition; (ii) to examine how this variation compares to differences between lupin and a cereal, triticale, and (iii) to assess if mixing lupin with triticale provides a higher potential than does pure lupin regarding plant biomass and mineral soil N acquisition early in the crop cycle. Lupin (12 genotypes) and triticale plants were grown separately and in mixed species pairs in a replacement design for 1 and 2 months in three rhizotron experiments. Shoot and root biomass, root length, root expansion dynamics, N 2 fixation and mineral soil N uptake were measured. Differences among lupin species and genotypes regarding traits related to early growth and to mineral soil N uptake were observed, but all lupins demonstrated slow early growth and low ability to absorb mineral soil N compared to triticale. In lupin-triticale mixture, a contrast in early growth strategies between species induced a higher total soil mineral N uptake compared with pure lupin. Complementarity between lupin and triticale persisted during the second month, when interactions began. This complementarity may allow for reduced competition between species, favouring higher triticale biomass production than in pure triticale, without compromising lupin growth."

Effect of intercrops on thrips species composition and population abundance on French beans in Kenya	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA			English	Article						"Frankliniella occidentalis; Frankliniella schultzei; Hydatothrips aldolfifriderici; Megalurothrips sjostedti; intercropping; Thysanoptera; Thripidae; Fabaceae; Phaseolus vulgaris; natural enemies; associational resistance"	"MEGALUROTHRIPS-SJOSTEDTI THYSANOPTERA; WESTERN FLOWER THRIPS; FRANKLINIELLA-OCCIDENTALIS; COWPEA; MAIZE; TEMPERATURE; MANAGEMENT; PREDATORS; PESTS; RESISTANCE"	The study aimed at determining thrips species composition and thrips population density on French bean planted as a sole crop and as an intercrop with either sunflower, Irish potato, or baby corn, in various combinations. Field experiments were conducted in two seasons to examine: (1) thrips population development and thrips species composition over time, (2) effect of intercrops on thrips population density and natural enemies, and (3) effect of intercrops on French bean yield. The experiments were conducted at the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute, Embu, Kenya in a randomized complete block design with four replicates. The thrips population on French beans increased with time. It showed a peak at the flowering stage then started declining when the crops were nearing senescence. French beans hosted four thrips species, Megalurothrips sjostedti (Trybom), Frankliniella schultzei (Trybom), Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), and Hydatothrips aldolfifriderici (Karny) (all Thysanoptera: Thripidae) in order of decreasing abundance. The main thrips species on Irish potato and sunflower was F. schultzei. Baby corn hosted only Frankliniella williamsi (Hood) and Thrips pusillus (Bagnall). A monocrop of French bean hosted more thrips than a French bean intercrop mix. Thrips natural enemies such as Orius spp. and Ceranisus spp. were recorded in all crop plants but in especially high numbers on French bean and baby corn, respectively. Plots with French bean alone had about 1.4 times higher yields compared to intercropped plots of French bean with sunflower and French bean with baby corn. However, the percentage of pods that could get rejected on the market due to thrips damage was highest on plots with French bean alone (68 and 63%) and lowest on plots with French bean and baby corn (35 and 37%) in the first and second seasons, respectively. This study showed that a complex of thrips is found in the field and its composition varies with crop stage and species. Intercropping French bean with other crops compromises on French bean yield but reduces damage to the French bean pods, thereby enhancing marketable yield.	"[Nyasani, J.

"CYNODON-NLEMFUENSIS; ESTABLISHMENT; DOLICHOS"	Cowing of maize (Zea mays L), grain sorghum IJ(Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), dolicho (Lablab purpureus (L) Sweet), Amaranthus (Amaranthus cruentus var. Morelos) and forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L) Moench) intercropped during king grass planting was studied to determine forage production and its establishment. A random block design with 10 replications was used. The sowing was carried out in a typical red ferrallitic soil after a traditional preparation. Fertilization was at a rate of 0.5 t/ha of 6-3, 2-16 which was incorporated to the soil in the last harrowing. King grass population ranged between 9-14 plants/m(2) and it was not affected by intercropping. The highest population (25.3 plants/m(2)) was obtained in the grain sorghum (P < 0.001), the greatest king grass height (143 cm) was reached when forage sorghum or amaranthus were intercropped. The crop reaching the greatest height was amaranthus (159 cm) (P < 0.001) while maize was similar. King grass had a greater production (8.77 t/ha DM) when planted alone, although it did not differ from the treatments intercropped with dolicho, Amaranthus or forage sorghum. The lowest king grass production (3.68 t/ha DM)was attained when intercropped with grain sorghum. The highest yielding crop was maize (5.2 t/ha DM) (P < 0.001). It is concluded that the highest forage yields are obtained when king grass was planted alone or intercropped with maize, amaranthus and forage sorghum. The advantages of intercropping during king grass establishment are discussed.

J	"Hunady, I; Hochman, M"				"Hunady, Igor; Hochman, Miroslav"			Potential of Legume-Cereal Intercropping for Increasing Yields and Yield Stability for Self-Sufficiency with Animal Fodder in Organic Farming	CZECH JOURNAL OF GENETICS AND PLANT BREEDING			English	Article						"barley; field trials; intercrop; organic agriculture; pea; wheat"	MAIZE	Intercropping of grain legumes and cereals is a promising theme in organic farming for its potential for increasing and stabilizing yields, reducing weed pressure and sustaining plant health. On animal husbandry farms, pea-cereal mixtures may be an interesting crop harvested for green fodder as well as for feed concentrates. Increasing self-sufficiency with fodder is in agreement with the principles of organic agriculture, and it reduces the risks related to the import of soy protein that may be admixed with GM soya. In 2008-2011, plot trials (PT) with intercropped peas and spring cereals (wheat, barley) were conducted. Varieties and pea-cereal combinations were examined to find suitable varieties for intercropping, and the best pea to cereal ratio in the seed intercrop (pea to cereal ratios 80:20, 60:40, 40:60, 20:80). Results show that intercropping peas and spring cereals may be advantageous compared to monocultures. Pea-cereal intercrops produce high yields of green matter and concentrates especially when intercropped at the pea to cereal ratio of 60:40 and 40:60. In 2009, on five certified organic farms, controlled field trials (FT) were conducted with field pea (leaf type), spring barley and spring wheat in monocultures and intercrops (pea to cereal ratio 60:40). Forage yields were evaluated at pea growth phases BBCH-scale 79 and 83. Fresh yields of monocultures and intercrops were evaluated at grain harvest.

Until now, hardly any knowledge has been available on these effects of N derived from a preceding crop like spring peas (Pisum sativum L.) mixed with cereals or from winter peas. Therefore, field experiments were conducted in order to examine N mineralization and N preceding crop effect from six different winter pea genotypes (five regular-leaf-type peas and one semi-leafless pea) and one semi-leafless spring pea in three subsequent years (2003/04-2005/06) in pure and mixed stands with cereals on a silty loam, at the research farm of the University of Kassel, Germany. Immediately after grain harvest, total above-ground biomass was removed apart from the stubble, and a catch crop of either mustard and oil radish or mustard was sown, which was harvested in the first half of October. N uptake of catch crops was usually significantly higher after regular-leaf winter peas in pure stands (80-90 kg ha(-1)) when compared with semi-leafless winter and spring peas (69 and 49 kg ha(-1)), respectively. In mixtures, the N preceding crop effect of regular-leaf-type peas was more pronounced than that of the semi-leafless peas. It could be shown that winter peas make a higher contribution to the N supply of a subsequent crop in rotation than spring pea. For regular-leaf-type winter peas there was a significant correlation between N uptake of the catch crop and the amount of mineralized N at grain harvest. At this time under pure stands, on average 44, 15 and 12 kg N-min (NO3-N + NH4-N) ha(-1) in top soil and 25, 7 and 22 kg N-min ha(-1) in 30-90 cm soil depth were recorded for regular-leaf-type winter pea, semi-leafless winter pea and spring pea, respectively. Under mixtures, similar values for the different genotypes were recorded (15 and 7 kg N-min ha(-1) for topsoil and subsoil, respectively). This might be explained by the different uptake of mineralized N, the differentiated above-ground biomass and a probably higher root biomass, which may have caused increased rhizodeposition, assuming that root biomass is positively correlated with above-ground biomass. Based on these experiments it can be concluded that, after pea pure stands, the cultivation of catch crops is an absolutely essential measure to conserve mineralized N, which can be expected to be as high as 100 kg ha(-1). In the present experiments even these high amounts could be reduced to an environmentally irrelevant level of 30 kg ha(-1) by cultivation of a catch crop. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Legumes have nearly disappeared from local cropping systems under the pressure of the cotton monocropping model. To develop new legume-based cropping systems using a bottom-up approach, this study was based on local farmers' agroecological innovations. In a first step, called on-farm innovation tracking, five innovative legume-based cropping systems were identified and characterized on farms located in the study area through interviews with innovative farmers who had designed and implemented these cropping systems: (i) Sorghum and legume (cowpea, soybean or peanut) intercropping in rotation with maize or cotton; (ii) Soybean as a cash crop in rotation with maize or cotton; (iii) Red cowpea intra-annual succession with a biomass crop; (iv) Mucuna in rotation with maize; and (v) Pigeon pea in rotation with maize. In a second step, these five innovative cropping systems (ICSs) were implemented in participatory prototyping trials (PPTs) in two communities located in the study area were they were evaluated during field days by local farmers (field-day farmers) having no previous experience with ICSs. By comparing evaluations made by innovative farmers with those of field-day farmers, it was shown that (i) locally implemented ICSs adapted to local drivers of change are of great interest to other farmers, and (ii) the study's two-step participatory approach is an original and relevant way to co-design and introduce innovations."

Response of ground-dwelling arthropods to a 'push-pull' habitat management system: spiders as an indicator group	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						"abundance; Araneae; arthropods; diversity; habitat management; 'push-pull'"	"WOLF SPIDERS; STEM-BORER; PITFALL TRAPS; ARANEAE; MAIZE; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; AGROECOSYSTEMS; COLONIZATION"	Studies were conducted to assess the numerical response of ground-dwelling arthropods to a habitat management system ('push-pull') developed to control maize stemborers using spiders (Araneae) as an indicator group. In this cropping system, maize is intercropped with a stemborer moth-repellent (push) plant while an attractant trap crop (pull) is planted around this intercrop. Two study sites in western Kenya and one site at the Grain Crops Institute of the Agricultural Research Council in Potchefstroom, South Africa, were sampled. Treatments comprised a maize monocrop and an intercrop of maize and desmodium, Desmodium uncinatum Jacq., with Napier grass, Pennisetum purpureum (Schumach), as a trap crop around the field ('push-pull') in each site. Experiments were laid out in a completely randomized design with four replications at each site. Ground-dwelling spiders were sampled using a combination of pitfall traps and soil samples. A total of 2175 spiders, 78 species in 18 families, were recovered in Kenya and 284 spiders, 34 species in nine families, were recovered in South Africa. Lycosidae was the most abundant family, accounting for >50% of all individual spiders and 27.6% by species richness. Spiders were significantly more abundant at the Kenyan sites than in South Africa while species diversity was significantly higher in South Africa than at the Kenyan sites. At all sites, spider abundance was significantly higher in the 'push-pull' than in the maize monocrop plots. However, the overall spider diversity was only significantly higher in the 'push-pull' than in the maize monocrop plots in South Africa. Moreover, species dominance did not differ between the two cropping systems at all sites. The results showed that the 'push-pull' system evidently enhances overall abundance of spiders, illustrating its potential in further pest control in the maize agroecosystems where spiders may often be one of the most important predatory groups.

However, due to the shading from maize, soybean plants are thin and have a poor root system. Uniconazole is a plant-growth retardant that could enhance root vigor; increase root length, root volume, and root dry weight; and affect nitrogen (N) metabolism. To understand the effects of uniconazole on the root growth and N-transfer metabolism of soybean seedlings under relay strip intercropping, the changes in some morphological characteristics of root, dry-matter weight, root vigor, nitrate (NO3-)-N, ammonium (NH4+)-N, and amino acid of xylem sap after seed treatment with uniconazole powder (0, 2, 4, and 8 mg kg(-1) seed) were investigated. Main root length, total lateral root lengths, first lateral root numbers, root nodule numbers, root vigor together with bleeding sap, bleeding sap-top ratio, root dry weight, and root/shoot ratio were increased, indicating uniconazole improved soybean root system in relay strip intercropping. Uniconazole powder treatment could increase NO3 (-)-N, NH4+-N, and total amino acid of xylem sap, to increase the potential of leaf and root N reduction and assimilation, and increase of leaf and root N contents. Thus, results suggested that uniconazole treatment can improve root growth and N transfer mechanism of soybean to support its further growth."

An experiment was carried out at two sites in 1993 and 1994 to investigate the effects of seeding soybean or lupin alone or in combination with one of three forages (annual ryegrass, Lolium multiflorum Lam.; perennial ryegrass, Lolium perenne L.; red clover, Trifolium pratense L.) on silage yield and quality. The intercrop plots received 90 kg ha(-1) less nitrogen fertilizer than monocrop plots, which received 180 kg ha(-1). Corn biomass yield had a variable response to the treatments, but showed no change at most site-years. Soybean and lupin biomass yields were decreased by intercropping (80-98 % for soybean, and 94-100 % for lupin). However, when corn growth was limited due to poor establishment at one site in 1994, soybean was able to grow well and produce yields similar to those of monocropped soybean. The three underseeded forages did not grow well during the period examined (up to silage harvest) and had no effect on the yield of any crop. Total silage yields were similar to corn monocrop biomass yields even during 1994 at the site with low corn population densities because soybean was able to compensate for reduced corn growth."

Methods A field experiment (ICAR RCER, Patna, India; 2009-2016) tested four common farming practices: S1, a wheat-rice fallow rotation with complete removal of crop residues; S2, best management practices (BMPs) with puddled transplanted rice, drill-seeded wheat in no-tillage (NT), and drill-seeded mungbean in conventional tillage (CT) in a wheat-mungbean-rice rotation where residues were retained on surface in rice and wheat, and residue incorporated in mungbean; S3, CA system in a wheat-cowpea-rice rotation; and S4, BMP intensified and diversified cropping system in a potato + maize-cowpea-rice rotation (unpuddled transplanted rice with dribbled maize + potato, intercropped) in CT and relayed dibbling of cowpea in NT. Full residues of potato and cowpea were incorporated and one-third portion of rice and maize residue were retained on soil. Key results After 7 years, S2, S3 and S4 systems lowered soil bulk density and penetration resistance compared to S1. S3 resulted in higher soil macro-aggregates (>0.125 mm) and lower soil micro-aggregates (<0.125 mm). Avoiding tillage in wheat and including a food legume in rotation in S2 increased annual rice equivalent yields by 30.5-34.4%. S4 had the highest water productivity (1.04 kg rice equivalent grain m(-3)) and S1 had the lowest (0.64 kg rice equivalent grain m(-3)).

Yield gain could potentially be related to a relaxation of competition, due to complementarity or facilitation, and/or to the competitive dominance of the higher yielding species. The contributions of competitive relaxation and dominance were here estimated using the concepts of complementarity effect (CE) and selection effect (SE), respectively. We compiled a dataset on intercropping of grain-producing crops from China, a hotspot of strip intercropping in the world. We quantified the yield gain and its components and analysed the contribution to yield gain of species traits (C3, C4, legume, non-legume), complementarity in time and nutrient input. Total yield in intercrops exceeded the expected yield, estimated on the basis of sole crop yields, by 2.14 +/- 0.16 Mg ha(-1) (mean +/- standard error). Ninety percent of this yield gain was due to a positive CE while the remaining 10 % was due to SE. The net yield gain increased with temporal niche differentiation (TND) which is the proportion of the total growing period of the crop mixture during which species grow alone. The mechanism underlying yield gain shifted from competitive dominance of the higher yielding species when there was more overlap in growth period between the two species, to competitive relaxation when there was less overlap, while competitive relaxation remained the major component of the yield gain. The yield gain was substantially greater in intercrops with maize than in intercrops without maize, but there was no difference in yield gain between systems with and without legumes. The yield gain increased with nitrogen (N) input in maize/C3-cereal intercrops but not in cereal/legume intercrops, illustrating the ability of legumes to compensate for low N input, and highlighting the need for N input for high productivity in intercropping systems without legumes. Yield gain did not respond to phosphorus (P) input. We conclude that competitive relaxation is the main contributing factor to yield gain in the investigated Chinese intercropping systems, which were mostly relay strip intercropping systems. The underlying drivers of yield gain were related to presence of maize and species complementarity in time, but we did not find strong evidence for the selection effect.

The gradual leaching of residual NO(3)(-)into soil layers below the root zone is the main way of nitrogen (N) loss in cropping systems. The interception of NO(3)(-)by subsurface roots is crucial for crops or vegetables to utilize N. However, few studies were focused on the mechanisms of NO(3)(-)leaching under intercropping of deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants. Materials and methods In a greenhouse production system, we selected deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants for single-season intercropping planting experiments (MP, monoculture of pepper; IPA, intercropping of pepper and alfalfa; IPM, intercropping of pepper and maize). Plants were grown in core drainage lysimeters for 4 months, and leachate was collected by soil solution samplers. The results revealed N transformations between monoculture and intercropping systems by comparing NO(3)(-)leaching, N use efficiency, and microbes involved in nitrification. Results and discussion NO(3)(-)accumulation mainly occurred in 25-40-cm soil layer, which was affected by root morphology. Compared with monoculture, intercropping reduced NO(3)(-)leaching, in particular, pepper/maize intercropping significantly reduced NO(3)(-)leaching losses. In deep soil layers, roots of alfalfa and maize were more developed than those of the other crops, which made this corresponding intercropping system more effective in absorbing N in the subsoil. N uptakes of pepper/alfalfa intercropping and pepper/maize intercropping were 19% and 28% higher than that from the monoculture, respectively. Ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were significantly stimulated with planting especial in the topsoil, while ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) decreased with planting along the soil profile. These results indicated that lush plant roots immobilized N from the deep soil and thus improved N use efficiency and reduced NO(3)(-)leaching in the deep-rooted and shallow-rooted intercropping system. Conclusions Intercropping of shallow-rooted pepper with deep-rooted alfalfa can enhance root nutrient absorption in deep soil layers, increasing N use efficiency and thus reducing NO(3)(-)leaching. The nitrification process in the intercropped soil was mainly regulated by AOB."

The aim of the study was to determine the potential of border crops and intercrops in the management of aphids and the associated viruses in hot pepper production. Field experiments were carried out for two seasons in 2018/2019 at Rubona Research station, Huye District, Rwanda. Maize (Zea Mays L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus) were tested as companion crops associated with hot pepper either as border crops or as intercrops. Randomized complete block design was used with four treatments and three replications per experiment. Data on aphid population, the virus disease incidence, the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC), growth and yield of hot pepper were recorded. Diseased leaf samples were collected and analysed serologically to detect the viruses present in the experimental plots. Aphid-transmitted viruses; Cucumber mosaic virus, Potato virus Y and Pepper veinal mottle virus, and aphid species, namely Aphis gossypii and Macrosiphum euphorbiae were identified in the experimental plots. The use of maize, sorghum or sunflower as border crops or as intercrops significantly reduced (p < 0.05) the incidence of viral diseases in hot pepper compared with control at later stages of growth. At 12 weeks after transplanting (WAP), use of maize, sunflower or sorghum as border crops significantly reduced (p < 0.05) the incidence of viral diseases by 24%, 31% and 38% compared with the control in season one and by 32%, 54% and 46% in season two. Similarly, intercropping with maize, sunflower or sorghum was also effective in reducing incidence of viral diseases in hot pepper by 24%, 35% and 27% in season one, and by 39%, 39% and 32% in season two, respectively. The AUDPC differed significantly (p 0.05) while the population of aphids did not differ (p 0.05) among treatments for both experiments. Results revealed that maize, sorghum and sunflower can be utilized either as border crops or intercrops for the control of viral diseases in pepper production. This technology is environmentally friendly, easily adaptable and appropriate since the production of pepper is mainly done by resource-poor farmers."

The experiment was conducted during the 2017 and 2018 cropping seasons in order to evaluate the effect of a Sorghum-mung bean intercrop arrangement on a Sorghum-based cropping system that would maximize intercropping advantage without reducing Sorghum performance. The treatments were combinations of sole Sorghum, sole mung bean, one Sorghum by one mung bean row (1 : 1), one Sorghum by two mung bean rows (1 : 2), two Sorghum by one mung bean row (2 : 1), and mixed planting of Sorghum and mung bean (50/50), which were tested in a randomized complete block design replicated four times. The highest yield reduction was observed from intercropping mixed planting (15.63%), in addition, the mean intercropped Sorghum yield showed up to12.44% reduction compared to sole stand. On the other hand, best-intercropped Sorghum yields that were produced under combinations of 2 : 1 row arrangement (4.11 t center dot ha(-1)) gave a statistically similar yield to all combinations including sole stand (4.48 t center dot ha(-1)). Significant row arrangement effect showed that the row (1 : 2) gave the highest yield for mung bean (0.35 t center dot ha(-1)), while the lowest was recorded from row arrangement (1 : 1) (0.16 t center dot ha(-1)). The highest total LER was obtained at 1 : 2 row (1.23) arrangements. The highest net return and marginal return (MRR) (341.23%) was obtained from one-row Sorghum alternated with two-row mung bean (1 : 2). Therefore, farmers around the research area can get additional income from intercropping Sorghum with bean crops without adversely affecting Sorghum yield by using one-row Sorghum alternated two-row mung bean (1 : 2) row arrangement.

Optimizing Seeding Ratio for Semi-Leafless and Leafed Pea Mixture with Precise UAV Quantification of Crop Lodging	AGRONOMY-BASEL			English	Article						"field pea; leaf morphology; intercropping; leaf-type mixture; near-isogenic line; canopy height model"	"FIELD PEA; PISUM-SATIVUM; MYCOSPHAERELLA BLIGHT; SW AUSTRALIA; YIELD; PERFORMANCE; MORPHOLOGY; ADVANTAGES; FIXATION; PATTERNS"	The field pea has both semi-leafless (SL) and leafed (L) types. Mixing these two types together might improve yield by optimizing pea solar radiation interception, reducing lodging, and decreasing disease. However, an optimum mixing ratio has not yet been established, since previous studies mixed two leaf types from two separate varieties. This study used four near-isogenic pairs of pea genotypes differing only in leaf type to determine the optimal mixing ratio for yield and agronomic traits. Two leaf types were mixed at seeding in five mixing ratios: 0:100, 50:50, 67:33, 83:17, and 100:0 SL/L. With precise UAV quantification of canopy height (r(2) = 0.88, RMSE = 2.6 cm), the results showed that a ratio of over 67% semi-leafless pea had a 10% greater lodging resistance when compared to the leafed monoculture. For mycosphaerella blight and Uromyce viciae fabae rust diseases, the 83:17 mixture decreased disease severity by 4% when compared with the leafed monoculture. Regression analysis of yield estimated that the 86:14 ratio provided an 11% increase to the leafed monoculture, but there was no increase compared with the semi-leafless monoculture. Mixing the two types in a high semi-leafless ratio can reduce leafed lodging and prevent yield loss but does not increase the overall yield over the semi-leafless monoculture.

Evaluation of tillage and crop establishment methods integrated with relay seeding, of wheat and mungbean for sustainable intensification of cotton-wheat system in South Asia	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Cotton-wheat system; Sustainable intensification; Conservation agriculture; Permanent beds; Relay seeding"	"INDO-GANGETIC PLAINS; WATER PRODUCTIVITY; CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; ZERO-TILLAGE; RICE; YIELDS; ROTATION; RESIDUE; PROFITABILITY; ENERGY"	"Intensive tillage-based conventional cotton-wheat system (CWS) entails, high production costs and has low crop and water productivity thereby threatening its sustainability in the north-western India. Conservation agriculture (CA) based management practices such as conservation tillage, permanent raised beds and relay planting have the potential to improve sustainability, profitability, and water use efficiency in CWS. A two-year (2013-2015) field experiment was conducted to evaluate CA based management practices such as zero tillage (ZT), permanent beds, relay seeding (RS) of wheat, seeding configuration, and integration of mungbean (MB) in terms of crop productivity, input use efficiency (water and energy) and profitability in the CWS system. Treatments included; permanent narrow (67.5 cm, PNB) and broad (102 cm, PBB) raised beds with cotton planted in the centre of beds, ZT narrow flats (67.5 cm, ZTNF) and broad flats (102 cm, ZTBF), and PBB with cotton planted on one side of bed and intercropped with MB (PBBc + MB) or no MB (PBBc). In the above treatments, wheat was relay seeded in standing cotton after second picking. In addition, conventional till (CT) CWS on flats was included as control treatment. PBBc + MB produced 37% and 10% higher system productivity (2 yrs' mean) over CT and PBB, respectively. Relay seeded wheat on PBB produced 50% higher yield and required 40% less irrigation water compared to CT wheat in both the years. Mean system irrigation water productivity (WP1) was 131% higher with PBBc + MB compared with CT. The energy input was 61% higher in CT compared to PBB but energy output was 21% higher with PBB than with CF. PBB and PBBc + MB recorded 52-54% higher energy productivity and 64-69% higher net returns compared to CT. In conclusion, PBB and PBBc + MB were the best options for sustainable CWS under similar soil and climatic conditions in India. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

In general, the composition of these constituents in raw soybeans is affected by cultivation factors, such as sunlight; however, the relationship of the isoflavone and fatty acid profiles with cultivation factors is not well understood. This study evaluated the isoflavone and fatty acid profiles in soybeans grown under a maize-soybean relay strip intercropping system with different row spacings, and with changes in the photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) transmittance. The effects of PAR on the isoflavone and fatty acid contents were found to be quadratic. Appropriate intercropping shading may reduce the bitterness of soybeans caused by soy aglycone and could improve their fatty acid composition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Most studies have evaluated the impact of zero till (ZT) only on surface soil layers (down to 30 cm), and few studies have been performed on the potential for C accumulation in deeper layers (0-100 cm) of tropical and subtropical soils. In order to determine whether the change from conventional tillage (CT) to ZT has induced a net gain in SOC, three long-term experiments (15-26 years) on free-draining Ferralsols in the subtropical region of South Brazil were sampled and the SOC stocks to 30 and 100 cm calculated on an equivalent soil mass basis. In rotations containing intercropped or cover-crop legumes, there were significant accumulations of SOC in ZT soils varying from 5 to 8 Mg ha-1 in comparison with CT management, equivalent to annual soil C accumulation rates of between 0.04 and 0.88 Mg ha-1. However, the potential for soil C accumulation was considerably increased (varying from 0.48 to 1.53 Mg ha-1 yr-1) when considering the soil profile down to 100 cm depth. On average the estimate of soil C accumulation to 100 cm depth was 59% greater than that for soil C accumulated to 30 cm. These findings suggest that increasing sampling depth from 30 cm (as presently recommended by the IPCC) to 100 cm, may increase substantially the estimates of potential CO2 mitigation induced by the change from CT to ZT on the free-draining Ferralsols of the tropics and subtropics. It was evident that that legumes which contributed a net input of biologically fixed N played an important role in promoting soil C accumulation in these soils under ZT, perhaps due to a slow-release of N from decaying surface residues/roots which favored maize root growth.

There were no data available to test whether there is a relationship between incident PAR underneath crop canopies and tuber production of this weed. In this study, the effect of crop competition on net reproductive rates of purple nutsedge tubers was measured under field conditions. Purple nutsedge plants were grown in association with bush beans, maize, maize and beans intercropped, sweet potato, pole beans, and bell pepper in a 2-yr field study in Costa Rica. Measurements were taken on the number of tubers produced during the growing season of each crop, and PAR transmittance was monitored weekly for the duration of the respective cropping cycles. Data on transmittance and incident solar radiation were used to calculate the daily average amount of PAR, available 15 cm above the soil surface. Regressions indicated that average incident PAR accounted for 95% of the variation in net reproductive rates. Average incident PAR also allowed a more precise competitive ranking of crops than either average or minimum transmittance. Bush beans had consistently the lowest average incident PAR values and therefore ranked as the most competitive crop in both years. Our data suggest that no net increase in tuber populations occurs if average incident PAR is below 2.7 MJ m(-2) d(-1). Differences in the duration of the cropping cycle accounted only for a small proportion of the overall variation in net reproductive rates of purple nutsedge tubers. Information on the competitive ranking of different crops can be used to design crop rotations that could reduce reliance on herbicides on small farms in Costa Rica.

However, the effects of applying lime and gypsum alone or in combination on the microbial population and N cycle in intercropped no-till tropical systems are largely unknown. Here, we determined the lasting effects of applying lime and gypsum individually or in combination on soil chemical properties, N uptake by intercropped plants, maize yield, archaeal and bacterial abundances, and N cycle genes in the maize and ruzigrass rhizospheres in a long-term field experiment in tropical soil with a no-till maize and forage ruzigrass intercropping system. Our results showed that the application of lime or lime + gypsum increased soil fertility and the gene abundances of microorganisms responsible for biological nitrogen fixation and reduced gene abundances of nitrification and denitrification in the soil and rhizosphere of ruzigrass and maize. The accompanying increases in Ca2+ and Mg2+ availability, reduced Al3+ levels, and balance of micronutrient availability, mainly Mn, in the soil strongly influenced the responses of N cycle genes and enhanced plant N-acquisition and maize yield.

Duffie"			Impact of intercropping on epidemics of groundnut leaf spots: defining constraints and opportunities through a 7-year field study	PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						"Arachis hypogea; Cercospora arachidicola; Cercosporidium personatum; diversity; multicropping; peanut"	"CERCOSPORIDIUM-PERSONATUM; PEANUT; DISEASE; COMPONENTS; RESISTANCE; MANAGEMENT; PRODUCTIVITY; MECHANISMS; DIVERSITY; SEVERITY"	Plant diversity can have a profound impact on disease dynamics, with important applications for enhancing sustainability. Disease is often reduced by intercropping, but variability can be high. This study investigated integration of several management approaches to stabilize this variability for early leaf spot (ELS) and late leaf spot (LLS) of groundnut, over seven seasons in three phases. In phase 1, monocrops and alternating row and strip intercrops with maize were artificially inoculated with ELS in an area with little groundnut production. Reductions in AUDPC of 37-73% in strip treatments compared to monocrops prompted testing of the efficacy of intercropping in intensive production areas for phases 2 and 3. Additional treatments included cotton strip intercrops, and integration of intercropping with reduced fungicide treatments and partial resistance to leaf spots. In phase 2, the use of cotton strip intercrops lowered natural ELS epidemics by 25-41% (AUDPC) through delayed disease onset, but maize had inconsistent effects. Intercropping was not effective against LLS, which dominated in phase 3. Reduced fungicide regimes and partial resistance lowered disease, and in one case interacted with intercropping to enhance disease suppression. Groundnut yields generally were inversely proportional to disease levels and not significantly reduced by intercropping. Separate studies to determine maize impacts on ELS infection implicated disruption of dispersal as the mechanism of disease reduction. This work demonstrates that intercropping may be most effective where low levels of ELS are present, using strip patterns with cotton, and combined with other tools such as resistance and reduced fungicide application.

Therefore, in this study, changes in morphological traits, cytochrome content, photosynthetic characteristics, carbon status, and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) were investigated at 30 days after treatment (DAT) in shade-tolerant soybean variety Nandou-12 subjected to three different types of shading conditions; normal light (NL, all trifoliate-leaves of soybean plants were under normal light); unilateral shade (US, all right-side trifoliate-leaves of soybean plants from top to bottom were under shade while all the left-side of trifoliate-leaves from top to bottom were in normal light); bilateral shade (BS, all trifoliate-leaves of soybean plants were under complete shade). Compared with BS, US conditions decreased plant height and increased stem diameter, leaf area, and biomass at 30 DAT. Biomass distribution rates to stem, petiole and leaves, and photosynthetic characteristics were markedly improved by the US at all sampling stages, which proved to be a better growing condition than BS with respect to shade tolerance. The enhanced net photosynthesis and transpiration rates in the left-side leaves (LS) of soybean plants in US, when compared with the LS in BS, allowed them to produce higher total soluble sugar (by 70%) and total soluble protein (by 17%) at 30 DAT which reduce the adverse effects of shading at right-side leaves (RS) of the soybean plants. Similarly, soybean leaves under US accumulated higher proline content in US than the leaves of BS plants. Soybean leaves grown in shading conditions (LS and RS of BS and RS of US) developed antioxidative defence-mechanisms, including the accelerated activities of SOD, POD, APX, and CAT. Comparatively, soybean leaves in US displayed lower activity levels of the antioxidative enzymes than the leaves of BS plants, showing that soybean plants experienced less shade stress in US as compared with BS treatment. Overall, these results indicate that the association of improved photosynthetic characteristics, sugar and protein accumulation and optimum antioxidative defences could be an effective approach for growing soybean in intercropping environments."

Agricultural management practices, such as split N applications and the use of controlled-release fertilisers have significantly increased the crop yield and N-use efficiency by balancing the N demand of crops and the N availability of soils. However, the impacts of these practices on GHG emissions (in particular in wheat-peanut relay intercropping systems) have not been evaluated in detail. In this study, a common compound fertiliser and a controlled release compound fertiliser (CRF) were used the day prior to sowing, at the jointing stage of wheat and at the peanut anthesis stage in ratios of 50-50-0% (JCF100), 35-35-30% (JCF70) and 35-35-30% (JCRF70), with a control treatment of 0 kg ha(-1). The findings demonstrated that treatment JCF70 achieved increases in yields of 9.7% and 14.6% for wheat grain and peanut pod, respectively, compared to treatment JCF100; however, this treatment also significantly increased soil emissions of CO2 and N2O. In addition, cumulative emissions of CO2 and N2O were higher in the peanut growing season by 74.4 and 31.7%, respectively, than in the wheat growing season owing to the relatively higher soil temperature during the former season. Fertilisation combined with irrigation, was found to be the main cause of GHG emissions. Under the same fertiliser rate and N-management style, JCRF70 further increased the yield of peanut pods and the total combined yield of peanut and wheat by 10.3% and 8.9%, respectively, compared to treatment JCF70. The cumulative CO2 and N2O emissions in treatment JCRF70 were 20.4-45.4% less than those in treatment JCF70. The total global warming potentials of CO2 and N2O were lowest in treatment JCRF70 owing to it providing the highest grain yield. Therefore, N application with three splits, together with the use of a slow-release fertiliser, may be a simple and effective approach to enhance the grain yield whilst reducing the GHG emissions."

Forage yield and quality of intercropped corn and soybean in narrow strips	SPANISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						"chemical composition; dry matter and ear yields; dry matter partitioning; Glycine max; intraspecific competition; Zea mays"	SILAGE	Maize-soybean intercropping can increase forage quality with no detrimental effect on dry matter (DM) yield. The objective of this study was to compare corn-soybean intercrop in narrow strips with corn as monocrop in terms of DM yield and forage quality. This study was conducted in Matamoros, Coahuila (Mexico) in 2006 and 2007. Intercrops were established in rows spaced 0.50 m apart, evaluating alternate corn-soybean strips with one, two, three, and four rows per crop, and a treatment using an alternate twin-row planting pattern per crop, with a 1.0-m row-spacing. As control treatments, monocrops of corn in rows 0.76 m apart and soybean in rows 0.50 m apart were evaluated. A randomized complete block design with four replications was employed. Corn-soybean intercrop produced DM yields similar to those of monocropped corn due to higher corn yields in border rows adjacent to soybean. Crude protein (CP) yields per hectare in intercrop treatments were higher (27.5 to 42.8%) than those of monocropped corn, due to greater CP concentrations in intercrops (16 to 21 g kg(-1)). When soybean was harvested at the beginning maturity stage (R7), neutral detergent fiber concentration was reduced by 60 to 63 g kg(-1) in corn-soybean intercropping compared to corn monocrop. Acid detergent fiber was not altered by intercropping. Results indicate that maize-soybean intercrop in narrow strips can provide forage quality advantages without affecting yield.	"[Reta Sanchez, D.

J	Jensen, ES				Jensen, ES			Barley uptake of N deposited in the rhizosphere of associated field pea	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							"NITROGEN TRANSFER; ROOT-SYSTEM; FIXATION; SOIL; GROWTH; ALFALFA; FUNGI; MAIZE; INTERCROP; EXCRETION"	N deposited in the rhizosphere of a legume may contribute to the N-nutrition of an intercropped non-legume. The process of deposition and subsequent uptake by a neighbouring plant is often termed N-transfer. The N-transfer from field pea (Pisum sativum L.) to associated spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was determined in three pot experiments using a direct split-root N-15-labelling technique. The donor (pea) and receiver (barley) plants were grown with their root systems either mixed within the same soil compartment or separated by a 20 mu m mesh bag. Pea-derived N was detected in barley after 4 weeks of growth, but in most associations <1% of total pea N was recovered in barley. N-transfer from barley to pea was not detected when barley was grown as the donor. The amount of pea-derived N in barley increased markedly with time, probably due to the accelerated turnover of root and nodule debris. Separating the root systems reduced the barley recovery of pea-derived N to about half the amount recovered in the association where root systems grew in the same compartment. The death of pea, caused by spraying with a herbicide, increased the amount of N recovered in barley, whereas shading the pea plant had no effect on the amount of pea-derived N taken up in barley. The N deposited up to 45 days of growth contributed <5% of the barley shoot N in most treatments. However, at 70 days, 19% of the N in barley was derived from pea. It is concluded that field pea rhizodeposition of N may be a significant source of N to intercropped barley, especially at low rates of N-fertilization.

Increasing crop diversity through intercropping addresses the problem of increasing land utilization and crop productivity. In collaboration with farmers and extension personnel, we tested intercropping of tobacco, maize, sugarcane, potato, wheat and broad bean - either by relay cropping or by mixing crop species based on differences in their heights, and practiced these patterns on 15,302 hectares in ten counties in Yunnan Province, China. The results of observation plots within these areas showed that some combinations increased crop yields for the same season between 33.2 and 84.7% and reached a land equivalent ratio (LER) of between 1.31 and 1.84. This approach can be easily applied in developing countries, which is crucial in face of dwindling arable land and increasing food demand.

The field experiment was carried out during 2010-12 and it was conducted using randomized block design in four replicates. Weed control was mechanical (spring-tine harrow treatment of variable intensity) and chemical (herbicide Chwastox Extra 300 SL - 3L per ha). Fungal colonization tests were carried out on disinfected and non-disinfected grains. The research has shown statistically significant differences in the total number of fungi isolated from disinfected and non-disinfected grains in particular years of study, between the objects, and in some cases between the study years. The fungus most frequently isolated from all variants of the experiment was Alternaria alternata. Penicillium cluysogenum was isolated only from non-disinfected grains. Presented results show that mechanical weed control treatments of appropriately adjusted intensity do not increase fungal colonization of barley grains in mixed culture with peas, as compared to the herbicidal control. The best variant of mechanical weed control for the cereal-legume mixture in terms of mycological quality of barley grain was one passage of spring-tine harrow at full tillering stage of barley. Mechanical weed control may be an alternative to herbicides in weed control in cereal-legume mixtures and may be particularly important for organic and integrated farming.

The experiment was conducted in a degraded pasture area in a dystrophic Oxisol. Treatments were arranged in a factorial 4 x 4 + 5, with the first factor corresponding to maize cultivars (UFV M100, DKB 390, DKB 455, and DKB 789) in consortium with Urochloa Brizantha, with different weed managements (weeded; no weed control; atrazine (1.5 kg ha(-1)) and atrazine + nicosulfuron (1.5 kg ha(-1) + 8 g ha(-1)), in addition to U. brizantha weeded monocultures and four maize cultivars. The experimental design was a randomized block with four replications. At 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 days after planting (DAP), maize dry matter and brachiaria dry matter were evaluated, with the last evaluation was determining maize grain yield. Higher dry matter accumulation and yields were obtained using maize and brachiaria monocultures. However, the application of atrazine + nicosulfuron in consortium produced maize grain yield similar to that obtained in monoculture. The effects of weed and maize cultivar managements on brachiaria growth were only manifested in the assessments at 90, 120 and 150 DAP. The maize hybrids were found to be more competitive with brachiaria than the variety; the highest grain yield was obtained with the simple hybrid (DKB 390) and the lowest with the triple hybrid (DKB 455). The interference of U. brizantha in maize depends on the management of the weed practices adopted."	"[Silva, P. I. B.] Univ Fed Rural Semi Arido, Mossoro, RN, Brazil; [Fontes, D. R.; Moraes, H. M.

Breeding beans for the target multiple cropping systems is essential for the development of productive and sustainable agriculture for the Andean smallholders. Outline of the breeding programme should follow the farming system approach with the establishment of on-farm trials and early farmers involvement. Bean breeding is oriented to minimize intercrop competition and to stabilize complementarity with maize. Genetic traits needed for improved varieties are divided as follows : traits not interacting with the cropping systems, traits specific to intercrops and traits related with socioeconomic and seed quality aspects. Screening, prebreeding and recombination nursery are better made under sole cropping while varietal improvement and on-farm trials are conducted under the target multiple cropping systems. Breeding schemes may involve recurrent, pedigree and bulk hybrid selection. The given application concerns the genetic improvement of P. coccineus, P. polyanthus and interspecific hybrids of P. vulgaris for both simultaneous and relay intercropping in Colombia and Peru. Earliness, cold tolerance, resistance to fungus diseases (mainly Ascochyta leaf blight and anthracnosis) and seed yield potential were the major objectives of the bean improvement programme. Priority has been given to the exploitation of the large diversity available in the secondary gene pool of common bean.

Fifteen growing crossbred heifers (JerseyxRed Sindhi) of between 7-10 months age and pre-trial average body weight of 49-50 kg were divided on the basis of weight in to three treatment groups viz. T-1-hybrid sorghum+soybean, T-2-setaria+soybean and T-3-hybrid napier+soybean in a completely randomized block design. Intercropped forages were harvested fresh, chaffed and mixed before they were offered to the heifers. Chemical composition of the herbage, dry matter intake (DMI), body weight gain and nutrient digestibility co-efficients were estimated. The herbage mixtures had crude protein (CP) content in the range of 11.87 to 13.86% and ether extract (EE) contents were 2.91 to 3.11%, respectively. The herbage mixtures were rich in minerals (ash). The gross energy (kcal/g DM) was higher in hybrid napier+soybean, while hybrid sorghum+soybean and setaria+soybean herbage mixtures had lower value for gross energy. The hybrid sorghum+soybean and setaria+soybean herbage mixtures had higher contents of NDF, ADF, cellulose, lignin and silica as compared to that of hybrid napier+soybean herbage mixture. The heifers fed hybrid napier+soybean herbage mixture had significantly (p<0.05) higher DMI g/kg W-0.75 (97.41 +/- 4.34) as compared to hybrid sorghum+soybean (88.31 +/- 2.66) and setaria+soybean (79.29 +/- 1.06) herbage mixtures. Nutrients digestibility, DCP percent, DCP intake and nitrogen balance were significantly (p<0.05) higher in the heifers fed on hybrid napier+soybean herbage mixture. There was a significant (p<0.05) difference among different herbage mixtures in TDN. The heifers on setaria+soybean herbage mixture had lower average body weight gain (g/day) than those on hybrid sorghum+soybean and hybrid napier+soybean herbage mixtures. Data obtained in this experiment demonstrated that herbage mixture of hybrid napier+soybean was better than hybrid sorghum+soybean and setaria+soybean herbage mixtures in the nutrition of growing heifers. It had highest nutritive value, batter digestibility co-efficients which showed better growth rate and higher feed efficiency. In ranking, hybrid napier+soybean herbage mixture was better followed by hybrid sorghum+soybean and setaria+soybean in nutritive value in the parameters studied. For future wasteland development program in humid-sub tropics of Himachal Pradesh hybrid napier and its intercropping with soybean is recommended for general adoption because of its better adaptability and higher nutritive value.

Relay intercropping with a legume cover crop can be a useful technique for improving N availability when two cash crops are grown successively. We evaluated the benefits of four relay intercropped legumes (Medicago lupulina, Medicago sativa, Trifolium pratense and Trifolium repens) on N dynamics and their contribution to the associated and subsequent cash crops in six fields of organic farms located in South-East France. None of the relay intercropped legumes affected the N uptake of the associated winter wheat but all significantly increased the N uptake of the succeeding spring crop, either maize or spring wheat. The improvement of the N nutrition of the subsequent maize crop induced a 30 % increase in grain yield. All relay intercropped legumes enriched the soil-plant system in N through symbiotic fixation. From 71 to 96 % of the N contained in the shoots of the legumes in late autumn was derived from the atmosphere (Ndfa) and varied between 38 and 67 kg Ndfa ha(-1). Even if the cover crop is expected to limit N leaching during wintertime, the presence of relay intercropped legumes had no significant effect on N leaching during winter compared to the control.

Straw Type and Nitrogen Fertilization Influence Winter Common Bean Yield and Quality	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION			English	Article						"Crotalaria spectabilis; Intercropping systems; No-tillage system; Phaseolus vulgaris; Topdressing nitrogen; Urochloa ruziziensis; Zea mays"	"USE EFFICIENCY; NO-TILLAGE; SUSTAINABLE INTENSIFICATION; PLANT; DECOMPOSITION; CONSERVATION; AGRICULTURE; SUCCESSION; NUTRITION; ROTATION"	The common bean grown under straw of intercropped plants improves the cropping environment in no-tillage systems. In addition, nutrient supply from straw could reduce the use of topdressing nitrogen in common bean. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate under no-tillage system the effect of straw type and topdressing nitrogen doses in the irrigated common bean productive and qualitative attributes. The experimental design was in randomized blocks arranged in split-plots with four replications. The plots were composed by three straw types from different cropping systems, represented by sole maize, maize-intercropped with brachiaria and maize-intercropped with crotalaria. The subplots consisted of five topdressing N doses applied on common bean 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 kg ha(-1)of nitrogen via urea (coated with polymers). The common bean grown under the straw of maize intercropped with crotalaria showed higher number of pods per plant, grain yield and lower time for maximum grain hydration when compared to those plants grown under the straw of sole maize. Moreover, the crude protein content in the common bean grains was greater when plants were grown under the straw of maize intercropped with crotalaria than the straw of maize intercropped with brachiaria. The agronomic efficiency of common bean was higher when the plants were grown under the straw of maize intercropped with crotalaria in the lowest nitrogen fertilization rate tested (50 kg ha(-1)). Leaf nitrogen content, grain yield, sieve yield and crude protein content in the grain increased with increasing nitrogen availability via topdressing. Therefore, the results suggest that agronomic and qualitative characteristics of common bean are benefited when cultivated on the maize straw combined with crotalaria even reducing up to 50% the requirement of nitrogen fertilization.

However, during the early co-growth period, soybean seedlings suffer from severe shading by maize resulting in lodging and significant yield reduction. The purpose of the present research was to investigate the reasons behind severe lodging and yield loss. Therefore, four different soybean genotypes (B3, B15, B23, and B24) having different agronomic characteristics were cultivated in intercropping and monocropping planting patterns. The results showed that under different planting patterns, the stem resistance varied among genotypes (P < 0.01). The lodging resistance index of B3, B15, B23, and B24 genotypes was 70.9%, 60.5%, 65.2%, and 57.4%, respectively, under intercropping, among which the B24 genotype was less affected by the shade environment as there was little decrease in the lodging resistance index of this genotype under intercropping. The lignin content of B23 and B24 was significantly higher than that of B3 and B15 under both planting patterns. Under intercropping, the hemicellulose content of B23 and B24 stems was significantly higher than that of B3 and B15. Compared to the monocropping, the content of mannose in the structural carbohydrate of soybean stems was decreased in all genotypes except B23, but the difference was not significant. The content of xylose in the structural carbohydrate of soybean stems was significantly higher than that in B3 and B15. Mannose content showed no significant difference among genotypes. The arabinose content of B24 was significantly higher than that of B3, B15, and B23. The effective pod number, seed number per plant, seed weight per plant and yield of soybean plants were significantly decreased under intercropping. Conclusively, manipulation of structural and nonstructural carbohydrate rich soybean genotypes in intercropping systems could alleviate the yield loss due to lodging.

Similarly, the effects of these sowing methods were also inferred on weed infestation. This study was conducted during the vegetation periods of 2018-19 and 2019-20 in terrestrial climate conditions. Sowing in perpendicular rows proved more effective in suppressing weed infestation than alternative rows and increased yield by reducing weed biomass. Sowing Hungarian vetch in mixed and perpendicular rows observed the highest weed infestation and biomass along with low green herbage and dry matter yield. However, Hungarian vetch-triticale mixture (50-50%) sowed in perpendicular rows made the best use of available land, resulted in the lowest weed infestation and biomass and recorded the highest green herbage and dry matter yield. In conclusion, the sowing Hungarian vetch-triticale mixture (50-50%) in perpendicular rows was the most suitable sowing method for improving productivity and suppressing weed infestation in Hungarian vetch-triticale intercropping.

Maize and soybean plots were arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replicates for a 3 X 2 factorial experiment. Factors were cropping systems (maize monoculture, soybean monoculture and strip intercropping of maize and soybean) and tillage systems (no-tillage and conventional tillage). The herbivore fauna of soybean was sampled by sweep net and suction net (D-Vac). Statistically significant results from at least 1 year indicated that no-tillage was favorable to Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica Newman), grape colaspis (Colaspis brunnea (F.)), tarnished plant bug (Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois)), homopterans (Cicadellidae and Cercopidae), grasshoppers (Melanoplus spp.) and slugs (Gastropoda). Potato leafhopper (Empoasca fabae (Harris)), green cloverworm (Plathypena scabra (F.)), and striped flea beetles (Phyllotreta spp.) were more abundant in conventional tillage plots. Strip intercropping was favorable to green cloverworm, Japanese beetle, and grape colaspis, whereas the potato leafhopper were more abundant in monoculture plots. There was no evidence of reduced herbivory in diversified agroecosystems, as predicted by the resource concentration hypothesis.

In this context, it is important to re-visit the resource-use efficiency and ecosystem service values of intercropping of grain legumes and cereals, a practice that has long been used by small-scale producers to mitigate the risk of crop failure and to safeguard household food availability. Despite its historical use, there are significant knowledge gaps regarding multiple aspects of intercropping, including examination of the different crop combinations on ecosystem services from agriculture. Using meta-analysis approach of land equivalent ratio (LER), a widely-accepted index to assess the efficiency of intercropping production systems, we found that intercropping of cereals with legumes resulted in an elevated LER (i.e., 1.31), regardless of species combination. A significantly greater LER than the overall LER (P < .05) was observed with the combination of maize-pigeon pea (LER = 1.57) and maize-groundnut (LER= 1.52). Increasing LER with intercropping was constant across rainfall variability, as well as in the absence of nitrogen fertilizer, which are the hallmark properties of intercropping in resource-deprived Africa. Intercropping could also reduce soil erosion, pest/weed incidence, and increase carbon sequestration by about similar to 46%, similar to 20-30%, and similar to 15%, respectively, compared to its sole crop control. In this comprehensive quantitative assessment of intercropping benefits across the African continent, we highlighted the provision of different ecosystem services from agroecosystems, a crucial foundation to achieving sustainable agricultural production.

The use of relay-intercropped forage legumes may be a way of providing ecological services such as weed control, increasing N availability in the cropping system thanks to N fixation, reducing N leaching and supplying nitrogen to the following crop. However, these ecological services can vary considerably depending on the growing conditions. The aim of this study was to identify early indicators to assess these two ecological services, thereby giving farmers time to adjust the management of both the cover crop and of the following crop. Nine field experiments were conducted over a period of three years. In each experiment, winter wheat was grown as sole crop or intercropped with one of two species of forage legumes; Trifolium repens L. or Trifolium pratense L Two levels of fertilization were also tested (0 and 100 kg N ha(-1)). After the intercropping stage, the cover crop was maintained until the end of winter and then destroyed by plowing before maize was sown. Legume and weed biomass, nitrogen content and accumulation were monitored from legume sowing to cover destruction. Our results showed that a minimum threshold of about 2 t ha(-1) biomass in the aboveground parts of the cover crop was needed to decrease weed infestation by 90% in early September and to ensure weed control up to December. The increase in nitrogen in the following maize crop was also correlated with the legume biomass in early September. The gain in nitrogen in maize (the following crop) was correlated with legume biomass in early September, with a minimum gain of 60 kg N ha(-1) as soon as legume biomass reached more than 2 t ha(-1). Legume biomass in early September thus appears to be a good indicator to predict weed control in December as well as the nitrogen released to the following crop. The indicator can be used by farmers as a management tool for both the cover crop and following cash crop.

Fiori & Paol.) and durum wheat (T durum Desf.), intercrops under furrow-irrigated raised-bed planting (FIRB) compared to existing planting pattern of sole wheat on flat bed and to identify suitable wheat variety for these intercropping systems. The cross-sown wheat gave significantly higher yield (5.08 tonnes/ha) than conventional sowing in lines and farmer's practice of broadcasting, with mean increase of 9.8 and 6.2 % respectively. Adoption of furrow-irrigated raised-bed system for sole wheat or intercropped with Egyptian clover or berseem (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) or relayed with summer maize (Zea mays L.) and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) marginally reduced wheat productivity (4.72, 5.70, 4.33 and 3.54% respectively) compared with cross-sowing but had edge over line sowing, however differences were not significant. The results showed that furrow-irrigated raised-bed planting of wheat with 2 rows/bed and simultaneous sowing of berseem in furrows with,multiple cuttings gave the highest wheat-equivalent yield (7.03 tonnes/ha) and per day productivity (57.07 kg/ha/day). This system also recorded the highest net returns (Rs 33 265/ha). Among varieties, 'HI 8498' durum wheat gave the highest wheat equivalent yield (5.89 tonnes/ha), productivity (41.4 kg/ha/day) and net profit (Rs 26 306/ha) compared with rest of the Varieties.

C. partellus gravid moths oviposited about a third of the total eggs on non-host crop cowpea or cassava. The oviposition on non-host crop was dependent on intercropping with host crops. The eggs were able to hatch on cowpea but the number of neonate larvae that arrived on the sorghum host diminished with distance. There was no difference between the number of eggs laid on cowpea plants at 22 cm and at about 315 cm away from sorghum. C. partellus oviposition on non-host crops is one of the mechanisms for its reduced abundance in intercropping.

Yet despite decades of promotion, CA uptake in SSA remains sparse with only few analyses of its impacts on farming and rural livelihoods. This study, which focuses on areas in Central Malawi considered to have a relatively high uptake of CA , uses analyses of satellite images, field observations, interviews with farmers, extension workers and other people involved in CA promotion, as wel l as a household survey, to investigate how CA has been adapted. We find that the three CA principles - (1) continuous minimu m tillage, e.g. no-ridging, (2) permanent ground cover, and (3) crop rotation/intercropping - were not practiced as intended. First, one-thi r d of non-ridged land was tilled during the growing season, and ha l f was again ridged in the following season. Second, unless crop residues were added, the soil's surface of non-ridged plots was usually bare at planting, causing weed control problems, and an increased risk of erosion. Most farmers added large volumes of crop residues to their non-ridged plots. They collected these from the surrounding fields, but this practice severely restricted the size of these plots. Third, crop rotation/intercropping was practiced less when farmers stopped ridging. Thus overall, very few farmers practised a l l of the three CA principles simultaneously. CA promotion appeared to only increase yields on plots where mulch was added, but this practice is not scalable. CA promotiondoes not seem to have provided substantial benefits for overa l l farm productivity, labour-savings or soi l conservation.	"[Bouwman, T. I.; Andersson, J. A.; Giller, K.

In this study, two soybean (Glycine max) seed production systems, monocropping (MC) and maize-soybean intercropping (IC), were employed to examine the effects of shading of the mother plant on subsequent seed germination. Compared to the MC soybean seeds, which received light, the developing IC seeds were exposed to shade resulting from the taller neighboring maize plants. The IC seeds germinated faster than the MC seeds, although there was no significant difference in the thickness of the seed coat. The concentration of soluble pro-anthocyanidin in the IC seed coat was significantly lower than that in the MC seed coat. Changes in the concentrations of several types of fatty acids in IC seeds were also observed, the nature of which were consistent with the effect on germination. The expression levels of genes involved in abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis were down-regulated in IC seeds, while the transcription levels of the genes related to gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis were up-regulated. This was consistently reflected in decreased ABA concentrations and increased active GA(4) concentrations in IC seeds, resulting in an increased GA(4)/ABA ratio. Our results thus indicated that shading of the mother plant during seed development in soybean promoted subsequent germination by mediating the biosynthesis of pro-anthocyanidins, fatty acids, and phytohormones.

For this purpose, a bi-crop of triticale (x Triticosecale Wittm.) and fava bean (Vicia faba L.) was established on an old low-input mixed sward (Lolium perenne-Trifolium repens). The association of triticale and fava bean in winter crops and wilting forages before ensiling improved ensilability characteristics. Wilting for 24 hours before ensiling avoided effluent losses during the fermentation process and reduced ammonia nitrogen production. Inoculation with Lactobacillus buchneri 40788, for a final application rate of 1x10(5) cfu g(-1) of fresh forage ensiled in laboratory silos during 80 days, promoted a higher CP concentration. Furthermore, it promoted changes in the concentration of fermentation end products, decreasing lactic acid and increasing acetic and propionic acids. The effects of Lactobacillus buchneri on aerobic stability were not confirmed in this study. Wilting depressed, but did not inhibit the activity of Lactobacillus buchneri in the fermentation process.

Prospects to utilise intercrops and crop variety mixtures in mechanised, rain-fed, temperate cropping systems	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE			English	Article						"farming systems; intercrop; mixtures"	"WHEAT CULTIVAR MIXTURES; LAND EQUIVALENT RATIO; GRAIN-YIELD; PEA-BARLEY; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; NITROGEN-FIXATION; RESOURCE CAPTURE; DURUM-WHEAT; WATER-USE; PLANT DIVERSITY"	Despite the potential productivity benefits, intercrops are not widely used in modern, mechanised grain cropping systems such as those practised in Australia, due to the additional labour required and the added complexity of management (e.g. harvesting and handling of mixed grain). In this review we investigate this dilemma using a two-dimensional matrix to categorise and evaluate intercropping systems. The first dimension describes the acquisition and use of resources in complementary or facilitative interactions that can improve resource use efficiency. The outcome of this resource use is often quantified using the land equivalent ratio (LER). This is a measure of the relative land area required as monocultures to produce the same yields as achieved by an intercrop. Thus, an LER greater than 1 indicates a benefit of the intercrop mixture. The second dimension describes the benefits to a farming system arising not only from the productivity benefits relating to increased LER, but from other often unaccounted benefits related to improved product quality, rotational benefits within the cropping system, or to reduced business risks. We contend that a successful intercrop must have elements in both dimensions. To date most intercropping research has considered only one of these two possible dimensions. Intercrops in large, mechanised, rain-fed farming systems can comprise those of annual legumes with non-legume crops to improve N nutrition, or other species combinations that improve water use through hydraulic redistribution (the process whereby a deep-rooted plant extracts water from deep in the soil profile and releases a small proportion of this into the upper layers of the soil at night), or alter disease, pest or weed interactions. Combinations of varieties within cereal varieties were also considered. For our focus region in the southern Australian wheatbelt, we found few investigations that adequately dealt with the systems implications of intercrops on weeds, diseases and risk mitigation. The three main intercrop groups to date were (1) 'peaola' (canola-field pea intercrops) where 70% of intercrops (n = 34) had a 50% productivity increase over the monocultures, (2) cereal-grain legume intercrops (n = 22) where 64% showed increases in crop productivity compared with monocultures and (3) mixtures of cereal varieties (n = 113) where there was no evidence of a productivity increase compared with the single varieties. Our review suggests that intercropping may have a role in large rain-fed grain cropping systems, based on the biophysical benefits revealed in the studies to date. However, future research to develop viable intercrop options should identify and quantify the genotypic differences within crop species for adaptation to intercropping, the long-term rotational benefits associated with intercrops, and the yield variability and complexity-productivity trade-offs in order to provide more confidence for grower adoption. Farming systems models will be central to many of these investigations but are likely to require significant improvement to capture important processes in intercrops (e.g. competition for water, nutrients and light).

Trin. ex Steud. Dominated Restored Coastal Brackish Fen	WETLANDS			English	Article						"CH4; Peatland; Spatial variation; Reed; Greenhouse gas emissions; Shallow lake; Rewetting; Restoration"	"GREENHOUSE-GAS BALANCE; NITROUS-OXIDE FLUXES; MANTEL TEST; PEATLAND; CARBON; SOIL; SULFATE; CH4; RHIZOSPHERE; OXYGENATION"	Methane is a major greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 25 times higher than carbon dioxide over a 100 year time horizon. Determining annual emission estimates, usually specified for different vegetation types under particular land use, requires the use of chamber measurements. These emission estimates may be strongly biased towards the lower or upper end by the spatial arrangement of measurement spots in the ecosystem. Here, we analyze the spatial variability of annual methane emission estimates based on non-steady state closed chamber measurements in pure and mixed stands of Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin ex Steud. in a restored coastal brackish fen. Annual methane emission estimates per measurement location vary largely between 46 and 1,329 kg ha(-1) a(-1) CH4 but they do not differ significantly between pure and mixed stands of P. australis. Mantel tests show a significant correlation of distances between spots and the variation in methane emission estimates (p < 0.05). Spatial correlation of water levels and annual methane emission estimates is not significant. Empirical variograms suggest that variance in annual methane emission estimates is not increasing with increasing spatial distance. However, spots that share larger distances may differ considerably in their annual methane emission estimates. At the same time, spots that share smaller distances-though these exceed the distances common to many closed chamber measurement setups-may differ less in their annual methane emission estimates. Thus, a huge part of the natural variation in annual methane emissions in a particular ecosystem or vegetation type may be missed when using the typical clustered arrangement of measurement locations in closed chamber studies. Therefore, we suggest that measurement locations should cover a wide spatial extent to improve the reliability of annual emission estimates per vegetation type and ecosystem, and that the number of measurement locations appropriate should be determined by pre-studies whenever possible.

This study aimed to evaluate tillering dynamics in black oat (Arena stngosa Schreb.) and annual ryegrass (Lolium multylorum Lam.) pastures grown as monocultures or intercropped. Three following treatments are established: black oat and annual ryegrass pastures grown as monocultures and an intercrop composed of these two species. Tillering dynamics were measured for black oat and annual ryegrass populations separately. When intercropped, tiller birth rates of black oat decreased (20.0 vs. 28.9 tillers 100 tillers(-1)) and those of annual ryegrass increased (30.5 vs. 14.3 tillers 100 tillers(-1)), compared to their monocultures. Tiller death rates for annual ryegrass did not differ between monoculture and intercropping (23.9 tillers 100 tillers(-1)), but black oat presented higher mortality in monocultures (48.8 vs. 36.4 tillers 100 tillers(-1)). The black oat monoculture had the lowest population stability index (0.80), whereas annual ryegrass in monoculture and intercropped pastures exhibited greater values (on average, 0.92). Our results indicated that black oat and annual ryegrass present distinct tillering dynamics whether grown as monoculture or intercropped, and suggest that intercropping species with elevated death rates (black oat) with later species (annual ryegrass) could be an important tool for maintaining pasture stability throughout the growing season."

Field pea has been largely studied in intercrop with wheat and barley in Northern and Central Europe whereas much less research has been carried out in semiarid environments of Southern Europe. A two-year field experiment was conducted in Southern Italy with the aim to assess yields and yield components and N use of field pea and four different cereals - wheat, barley, oat and triticale - grown in additive and replacement intercrop. The cereal was the dominant partner in intercrop, strongly outcompeting pea. Cereal height and biomass yield and intercrop density affected yield component parameters of pea causing a severe reduction of number of pods per plant and death of pea plants. Pea yields were generally lower in intercrop than in sole crop. Consequently, nitrogen accumulation in intercrop and Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) N yields-based values resulted negatively affected. LER values were highest in barley-pea intercrops for both grain and straw nitrogen yields. Cereal grain and straw N content increased in intercrop compared to the sole crop while pea grain N content was reduced. The results of this study indicate that cereal-pea intercropping can be a way of improving the grain and straw quality of the intercropped cereal and reducing N inputs into agricultural systems compared with the sole cropping. The choice of the companion cereal and the intercrop density should, however, be carefully evaluated in drought-prone environments like those of Southern Europe. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Besides, the crop is also used to check soil erosion, water conservation, and reclamation of salt affected soils. Being vetiver a wider spaced crop with a long initial lag phase, thus the only option to sustain its productivity is intercropping. In a field experiment conducted during July, 2010-February, 2012 and July, 2012-February, 2014 at Lucknow, 13 cropping systems: sole crop of each of vetiver, sweet basil-radish-Tagetes minuta, black gram-clarysage, kalmegh-garlic, okra-radish-geranium, pigeon pea-menthol mint, maize-radish-onion and intercropping of above cropping sequences with vetiver were evaluated in randomized block design with three replications. Intercropping of sweet basil-radish-T. minuta with vetiver during rainy and winter seasons though reduced vetiver oil yield by 16.7% but was highly productive in terms of land equivalent ratio (1.54), land use efficiency (130%) and relative net return (1.35) and a net return of US$ 4801.7 ha(-1) followed by intercropping of maize-radish-onion with vetiver. The system also gave about 35% more profit over the sole cropping of vetiver. ( C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lu, XL				Lu, Xingli			Effect of Intercropping Soybean on the Diversity of the Rhizosphere Soil Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi Communities in Wheat Fields	CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER			English	Article						"arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; crop yield; principal component analysis; soil enzymes; wheat; soybean"	"USE EFFICIENCY; YIELD; PRODUCTIVITY; PLANT; AGRICULTURE; PROSPECTS; NITROGEN; MAIZE; RICE"	The variations of rhizosphere soil arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and their impact mechanism are still unclear under different intercropping systems in the Yellow River Irrigation District of Ningxia, China. A field experiment to study variations in rhizosphere soil AMF diversity and its effects under different planting systems in this area. Three intercropping systems consisting of six rows of spring wheat intercropped with two rows of soybean (RSW), wheat monoculture (RW), and soybean monoculture (RS) were applied. The results showed that the RSW treatment has a 5.6% and 10.0% higher soil organic carbon (SOC) content than the RW and RS plots, respectively. The dominant genera in this study are Glomus and Paraglomus. The Shannon index, Simpson index, Chao1 value, and abundance-based coverage estimator in the RSW treatment are higher than in the RS plots. Additionally, the multiple linear regression equation suggests that invertase activity is the main impact factor for the Shannon index of AMF. Moreover, the wheat yield in the RSW plot is 11.4% higher than the RW plot. The results suggest that the RSW treatment has great potential for improving soil nutrients, AMF diversity, and wheat yield to sustain soil health and crop production.

Greater expression of yield components and higher seed yield occurred in sole cropping than in intercropping. There were strong progenies X cropping system interactions for different traits. Cropping system had a large influence on the genetic control of yield and its components. Both additive (sigma(A)2) and non-additive (sigma(D)2) genetic variances were important in the genetic determination of seed yield and its components. However, the ratio of sigma(A)2 to sigma(D)2 was greater under monoculture than under intercropping for all the traits except harvest index and 100-seed weight where it increased, thereby indicating that cropping systems influence the genetic control of important yield components. Further, the occurrence of low genotypic correlations for yield and its components across and cropping systems justify the selection of different parents and crosses for sole and intercropped soybeans.

Reduce pests, enhance production: benefits of intercropping at high densities for okra farmers in Cameroon	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						"intercropping; crop identity; high plant density; pests; predators; yield"	"LAND-USE EFFICIENCY; NATURAL ENEMIES; HOST-PLANT; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; FORAGING EFFICIENCY; HABITAT COMPLEXITY; INSECT HERBIVORES; OLFACTORY CUES; DIVERSITY"	BACKGROUND: Intercropping can help reduce insect pest populations. However, the results of intercropping can be pest- and crop-species specific, with varying effects on crop yield, and pest suppression success. In Cameroon, okra vegetable is often grown in intercropped fields and sown with large distances between planting rows (similar to 2m). Dominant okra pests include cotton aphids, leaf beetles and whiteflies. In a field experiment, we intercropped okra with maize and bean in different combinations (okra monoculture, okra-bean, okra-maize and okra-bean-maize) and altered plant densities (high and low) to test for the effects of diversity, crop identity and planting distances on okra pests, their predators and yield. RESULTS: We found crop identity and plant density, but not crop diversity to influence okra pests, their predators and okra yield. Only leaf beetles decreased okra yield and their abundance reduced at high plant density. Overall, okra grown with bean at high density was the most economically profitable combination. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that when okra is grown at higher densities, legumes (e.g. beans) should be included as an additional crop. Intercropping with a leguminous crop can enhance nitrogen in the soil, benefiting other crops, while also being harvested and sold at market for additional profit. Manipulating planting distances and selecting plants based on their beneficial traits may thus help to eliminate yield gaps in sustainable agriculture.

J	"Vrignon-Brenas, S; Celette, F; Amosse, C; David, C"				"Vrignon-Brenas, Sylvain; Celette, Florian; Amosse, Camille; David, Christophe"			Effect of spring fertilization on ecosystem services of organic wheat and clover relay intercrops	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"Intercropping; Wheat; Clover; Organic fertilizers; Weed control"	"CONVENTIONAL FARMING SYSTEMS; WINTER-WHEAT; GRAIN-YIELD; NITROGEN AVAILABILITY; WHITE CLOVER; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; SOIL FERTILITY; CEREAL-GRAINS; N-2 FIXATION"	Nitrogen (N) deficiency and weed infestation are main factors limiting yield and yield stability in organic wheat. Organic fertilizers may be used to improve crop performance but off-farm input costs tend to limit profitability. Instead, forage legumes may be inserted into the crop rotation to improve the N balance and to control weed infestation. In opposition to simultaneous cropping, relay intercropping of legumes in organic winter wheat limits resource competition for the legume cover crop, without decreasing the performance of the associated wheat. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of spring organic fertilization on the performance of intercropped legumes and wheat, and on services provided by the legume cover. Two species of forage legumes (Trifolium pratense L and Trifolium repens L.) were undersown in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L cv Lona) in five organic fields during two consecutive crop seasons. Organic fertilizer was composed of feather meal and applied on wheat at legume sowing. The cover crop was maintained after the wheat harvest and destroyed just before sowing maize. Spring organic nitrogen fertilization increased wheat biomass (+35%), nitrogen (+49%), grain yield (+40%) and protein content (+7%) whatever the intercropping treatment. At wheat harvest, red clover biomass was significantly higher than white clover one (1.4 vs. 0.7 t ha(-1)). Nitrogen fertilization decreased forage legume above-ground biomass at wheat harvest, at approximately 0.5 t ha(-1) whatever the specie. No significant difference in forage legume biomass production was observed at cover killing. Nitrogen accumulation in legume above-ground tissues was significantly higher for white clover than for red clover. Both red and white clover species significantly decreased weed infestation at this date. Nitrogen fertilization significantly increased weed biomass whatever the intercropping treatment and decreased nitrogen accumulation in both clover species (-12%). We demonstrated that nitrogen fertilization increased yield of wheat intercropped with forage legume while the performance of legumes was decreased. Legume growth was modified by spring fertilization whatever the species. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The present aims of the study is to enhance yield productivity and quality of kalmegh by providing natural shade condition through co-cultivation of traditional food crops [grain crops viz.maize (Zea mays L.) and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.), pulse crop pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L.) and vegetable crop okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L.)] for sustainable agriculture and better resource use efficiency. All traditional crops were intercropped with kalmegh at their full 100 % (55,555 plants ha(-1)), 75 % (37,037 plants ha(-1)), and 50 % (27,777 plants ha(-1)) plant population, with a full plant population of kalmegh (55,555 plants ha(-1)). The research findings revealed that intercropping of pigeon pea at 50 % plant population gave the highest dry herb of kalmegh (4412 kg ha(-1)) followed by okra at 50 % plant population (4253 kg ha(-1)) and kalmegh + pigeon pea at 75 % plant population (4011 kg ha(-1)) over the kalmegh sole (3080 kg ha(-1)).

(annual, Scrophulariaceae) and Viscaria vulgaris Bernh. (perennial, Caryophyllaceae) were studied on a dry meadow in south-western Sweden in June 1986 and 1988. Both species produced seeds by self-fertilization. In Melampyrum (homogamous) fruiting and seed set by selfing were much lower than by natural pollination; in Viscaria (protandrous) fruiting by selfing and by natural pollination were similar, but seed set per flower was lower by selfing than by natural pollination. Sequential hand pollinations increased seed set in Melampyrum, but not in Viscaria. Thus, the number of pollinations is important for high seed set in Melampyrum, and number of pollen grains seed set in Melampyrum, and number of pollen grains deposited one pollination is important for high seed set in Viscaria. Late flowering resulted in the production of fewer seeds in both species, although the visitation rate in pure Viscaria stands was sufficient, because of limited resources. Pollen was the limiting resource in Viscaria, because hand pollination increased natural seed set. In Melampyrum pollen was limiting in 1988 but so were consumable resources, because the seedset decreased with time despite hand pollination. Pure stands of Viscaria had seed set similar to plants in mixed stands (with Melampyrum and Rhinanthus), although plants in mixed stands received fewer visits. Many seeds produced late in the season are the result of self pollination; emasculated Viscaria flowers had a very low seedset late in the season. Pollen loads containing approximately 50% heterospecific grains did not affect seed set in either species. Application of heterospecific (Lupinus) pollen to receptive Viscaria styles 6 h before conspecific pollen did not affect seed set."

Using suppression subtractive hybridization from the roots of intercropped and monocropped peanut which show different iron nutrition levels, a peanut gene, AhNRAMP1, which belongs to divalent metal transporters of the natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (NRAMP) gene family was isolated. Yeast complementation assays suggested that AhNRAMP1 encodes a functional iron transporter. Moreover, the mRNA level of AhNRAMP1 was obviously induced by iron deficiency in both roots and leaves. Transient expression, laser microdissection, and in situ hybridization analyses revealed that AhNRAMP1 was mainly localized on the plasma membrane of the epidermis of peanut roots.

The present review shows that structuring the value chain around the products of this innovative cropping system faces a set of technical (i.e., varietal selection, phytosanitary issue control, crop management sequence, collection management, and storage), economic (i.e., cost, price, market opportunities, and contracting), and public policy (i.e., subsidies for ecosystem services provided by intercropping) obstacles that contribute to its slow adoption and dissemination in Europe. However, the value chain resulting from the wheat-pea intercropping system has levers to be exploited at all levels, particularly in terms of its competitive advantages, ecosystem benefits, and superior product quality. The results of this review help to identify priorities that actors of the value chain can address to better focus their efforts on significant problems and solutions that can accelerate the adoption and dissemination of this agroecological system.

Compared with legume sole cropping, grain legume-cereal intercropping benefits include better weed suppression and higher yield and yield stability. However, the potential of enhancing crop competitive ability against weeds in additive winter grain legume-cereal intercrops is not well-known, and this potential in long crop cycles is even less studied. We studied how intercropping with a triticale (xTriticosecale) alters weed biomass and productivity of winter white lupin (Lupinus albusL.). The experimental setup consisted of eleven sites during a two-year period in western France. In each site-year, winter white lupin sole cropping was compared to winter white lupin-triticale intercropping in an additive sowing design. We found that intercropping reduced weed biomass at lupin flowering by an average of 63%. The rapid growth and high soil N acquisition of triticale compensated for the low competitive ability of lupin against weeds until lupin flowering. Competition from triticale in the intercrop reduced lupin grain yield (-34%), but intercropping produced a higher total grain yield (+37%) than did lupin sole cropping while maintaining the total protein grain yield.

This study was determined to assess the influence of sowing ratio and N fertilization on yield and yield components of oat (Avena sativa L.) and pea (Pisum sativum L) in intercrops. A two-year field study was carried out on a fertile soil in eastern Austria with oat and pea sown in three substitutive sowing ratios and at different nitrogen levels. Oat was the dominant partner in the mixtures, strongly outcompeting pea. N fertilization increased the competitive ability of oat. Total grain yields were generally lower in intercrops than in pure stands; thus oat-pea intercrops failed to achieve a yield advantage. Sowing ratio and fertilization affected yield component parameters of oat and pea compared to the corresponding pure stands. Oat in intercrops used available environmental resources for increasing panicles plant(-1) and grains panicle(-1) whereas harvest index and grain weight of pea were negatively affected in the mixtures. In conclusion, oat-pea intercrops could no achieve higher grain yields than corresponding pure stands on a fertile soil. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The optimal use of soil and atmospheric sources of nitrogen in cereal-legume mixtures may allow farmers to maintain high production levels and good quality with low external N inputs, and could potentially decrease environmental impacts, particularly through a more efficient energy use. These potential advantages are presented in an overall assessment of cereal-legume systems, accounting for the agronomic, environmental, energetic, and economic performances. Based on a low-input experimental field network including 16 site-years, we found that yields of pea-wheat intercrops (about 4.5 Mg ha(-1) whatever the amount of applied fertiliser) were higher than sole pea and close to conventionally managed wheat yields (5.4 Mg ha(-1) on average), the intercrop requiring less than half of the nitrogen fertiliser per ton of grain compared to the sole wheat. The land equivalent ratio and a statistical analysis based on the Price's equation showed that the crop mixture was more efficient than sole crops particularly under unfertilised situations. The estimated amount of energy consumed per ton of harvested grains was two to three times higher with conventionally managed wheat than with pea-wheat mixtures (fertilised or not). The intercrops allowed (i) maintaining wheat grain protein concentration and gross margin compared to wheat sole crop and (ii) increased the contribution of N-2 fixation to total N accumulation of pea crop in the mixture compared to pea sole crop. They also led to a reduction of (i) pesticide use compared to sole crops and (ii) soil mineral nitrogen after harvest compared to pea sole crop. Our results demonstrate that pea-wheat intercropping is a promising way to produce cereal grains in an efficient, economically sustainable and environmentally friendly way. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The competitive ability of pea-barley intercrops against weeds and the interactions with crop productivity and soil N availability	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Intercropping; Weeds; Nitrogen; Pea; Barley; Organic farming"	"PISUM-SATIVUM L.; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; N-2 FIXATION; FIELD PEA; GRAIN-YIELD; NITROGEN; INTERFERENCE; WHEAT; DYNAMICS; BIOMASS"	Grain legumes, such as peas (Pisum sativum L), are known to be weak competitors against weeds when grown as the sole crop. In this study, the weed-suppression effect of pea-barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) intercropping compared to the respective sole crops was examined in organic field experiments across Western Europe (i.e., Denmark, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy). Spring pea (P) and barley (B) were sown either as the sole crop, at the recommended plant density (P100 and B100, respectively), or in replacement (P50B50) or additive (P100B50) intercropping designs for three seasons (2003-2005). The weed biomass was three times higher under the pea sole crops than under both the intercrops and barley sole crops at maturity. The inclusion of joint experiments in several countries and various growing conditions showed that intercrops maintain a highly asymmetric competition over weeds, regardless of the particular weed infestation (species and productivity), the crop biomass or the soil nitrogen availability. The intercropping weed suppression was highly resilient, whereas the weed suppression in pea sole crops was lower and more variable. The pea-barley intercrops exhibited high levels of weed suppression, even with a low percentage of barley in the total biomass. Despite a reduced leaf area in the case of a low soil N availability, the barley sole crops and intercrops displayed high weed suppression, probably because of their strong competitive capability to absorb soil N. Higher soil N availabilities entailed increased leaf areas and competitive ability for light, which contributed to the overall competitive ability against weeds for all of the treatments. The contribution of the weeds in the total dry matter and soil N acquisition was higher in the pea sole crop than in the other treatments, in spite of the higher leaf areas in the pea crops.

Proportion of PBS was 0 (PBSO), 33 (PBS33), 67 (PBS67) or 100 (PBS100) % of silage dry matter (DM). The DM content was 559 and 255 g kg(-1) for GS and PBS. Crude protein content was 131 and 170 g kg(-1) DM, respectively. Pea-barley silage was more extensively fermented than GS with total fermentation acid content of 120 vs. 12 g kg(-1) DM. Silage was fed for ad libitum intake and supplemented with on the average 13 kg concentrate per day. Silage DM intake was 9.2 (PBSO), 9.7 (PBS33), 9.0 (PBS67) and 7.1 (PBS 100) kg per day (P-quandr. < 0.05). The energy corrected milk yield [30.3 (PBSO), 29.8 (PBS33), 30.3 (PBS67), 31.3 (PBS100) kg per day] was not significantly affected by the treatment. Milk protein concentration decreased linearly (P < 0.05) in response to feeding PBS. It is concluded that PBS can replace up to two thirds of wilted, moderate quality GS in the feeding of dairy cows because in this experiment pure pea-barley silage reduced silage intake.

This is an improved land management system, developed by ILCA in collaboration with other national and international partners, to raise productivity of Vertisols. Soil water content monitored at soil depths of 0-50 cm and 50-100 cm indicated that lablab and cowpea deplete significantly greater amounts of available soil water during the growing season than vetch and clover. Deep rooted forage legumes lablab, cowpea and vetch are more suitable for combination with cereals such as maize than with wheat due to the phenological differences between the two crop types.

Agriculturally, nutritionally and culturally, these three crops are complementary. This literature review aims to compile historical foods prepared from the products of the Three Sisters planting system used in Indigenous communities in the region encompassing southern Quebec and Ontario in Canada, and northeastern USA. The review does not discuss cultural aspects of the Three Sisters cropping system or describe foods specific to any one Indigenous group, but rather, gives an overview of the historical foods stemming from this intercropping system, many foods of which are common or similar from one group to another. Some of the methods of food preparation used have continued over generations, some of the historical foods prepared are the foundation for foods we eat today, and some of both the methods and foods are finding revival.

Economic performance of the 'push-pull' technology for stemborer and Striga control in smallholder farming systems in western Kenya	CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						"stemborer; Striga; push-pull; gross margins; Kenya"	"PENNISETUM-PURPUREUM VARIETIES; STEM-BORER; CHILO-PARTELLUS; BUSSEOLA-FUSCA; DESMODIUM SPP.; TRAP PLANTS; MANAGEMENT; MAIZE; HERMONTHICA; SORGHUM"	The 'push pull' technology (PPT), developed in Africa, offers effective control of cereal stemborers and Striga weed in maize-based cropping systems. It involves intercropping maize with desmodium, Desmodium uncinatum, with Napier grass, Pennisetum purpureum, planted as border around this intercrop. Desmodium repels the stemborer moths (push) that are subsequently attracted to the Napier grass (pull). Desmodium also suppresses and eliminates Striga. We assessed economic performance of this technology compared to the conventional maize mono- and maize-bean intercropping systems in six districts in western Kenya over 4-7 years. Ten farmers were randomly recruited in each district and each planted three plots representing the three cropping systems. The cost-benefit analyses were carried out, together with the systems' net returns to land and tabour and their discounted net present values (NPV). Maize grain yields and associated gross margins from the PPT system were significantly higher than those in the other two systems. Although the production costs were significantly higher in the PPT than in the two cropping systems in the first cropping year, these reduced to either the same level or significantly lower than in the maize-bean intercrop from the second year onwards in most of the districts. Similarly, the net returns to land and tabour with the PPT were significantly higher than with the other two systems. The PPT consistently produced positive NPV when the incremental flows of its benefits compared to those of the two conventional systems were discounted at 10-30%, indicating that PPT is more profitable than the other two systems under realistic production assumptions. PPT is thus a viable option for enhancing productivity and diversification for smallholder farmers who largely depend on limited land resource. Hence, enhancing farmers' access to less costly planting materials and promoting quality education and training in the use of this knowledge-intensive technology could stimulate its successful adoption.

Climate-adapted companion cropping increases agricultural productivity in East Africa	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Insect pests; Striga; Climate change; Climate-adapted push-pull; Food security"	"STRIGA-HERMONTHICA; HABITAT MANAGEMENT; STEMBORER COLONIZATION; DESMODIUM-UNCINATUM; MAIZE PRODUCTION; CHILO-PARTELLUS; SOIL FERTILITY; ROOT EXUDATE; STEM BORERS; SORGHUM"	Production of cereals, the main staple and cash crops for millions of farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is severely constrained by parasitic striga weed Striga hermonthica, stemborers and poor soil fertility. A companion cropping system known as 'push-pull' overcomes these constraints while providing additional soil fertility and forage grass benefits to smallholder farmers. To ensure the technology's long-term sustainability in view of the current and further potential aridification as a consequence of climate change, drought-tolerant crops, Brachiaria cv mulato (border crop) and greenleaf desmodium (intercrop), have been identified and incorporated into a 'climate-adapted push pull'. The aims of the current study were to evaluate effectiveness of the new system (i) in integrated control of striga and stemborer pests and (ii) in improving maize grain yields, and to evaluate farmers' perceptions of the technology to assess potential for further adoption. 395 farmers who had adopted the technology in drier areas of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania were randomly selected for the study. Each farmer had a set of two plots, a climate-adapted push pull and a maize monocrop. Seasonal data were collected in each plot on the number of emerged striga plants, percentage of maize plants damaged by stemborers, plant height and grain yields. Similarly, farmers' perceptions of the benefits of the technology were assessed using a semi-structured questionnaire. There were highly significant reductions in striga and stemborer damage to maize plants in the climate-adapted push pull compared to the maize monocrop plots: striga levels were 18 times lower and stemborer levels were 6 times lower. Similarly, maize plant height and grain yields were significantly higher. Mean yields were 2.5 times higher in companion planting plots. Farmers rated the climate-adapted push pull significantly superior in reducing striga infestation and stemborer damage rates, and in improving soil fertility and maize grain yields. These results demonstrate that the technology is effective in controlling both weeds and pests with concomitant yield increases under farmers' conditions. It thus provides an opportunity to improve food security, stimulate economic growth, and alleviate poverty in the region while making agriculture more resilient to climate change.

ANNALS OF BOTANY			English	Article						"Turbid medium-based models; functional-structural plant models; light interception efficiency; light partitioning; intercropping systems; grass-legume mixtures; canopy structure; Festuca arundinacea; Medicago sativa; Pisum sativum; Trifolium repens; Triticum aestivum"	"RADIATION INTERCEPTION; THEORETICAL-ANALYSIS; GAP FRACTION; MODEL; SIMULATION; CANOPY"	Background and Aims Most studies dealing with light partitioning in intercropping systems have used statistical models based on the turbid medium approach, thus assuming homogeneous canopies. However, these models could not be directly validated although spatial heterogeneities could arise in such canopies. The aim of the present study was to assess the ability of the turbid medium approach to accurately estimate light partitioning within grass-legume mixed canopies. Methods Three contrasted mixtures of wheat-pea,tall fescue-alfalfa and tall fescue-clover were sown according to various patterns and densities. Three-dimensional plant mock-ups were derived from magnetic digitizations carried out at different stages of development. The benchmarks for light interception efficiency (LIE) estimates were provided by the combination of a light projective model and plant mock-ups, which also provided the inputs of a turbid medium model (SIRASCA), i.e. leaf area index and inclination. SIRASCA was set to gradually account for vertical heterogeneity of the foliage, i.e. the canopy was described as one, two or ten horizontal layers of leaves. Key Results Mixtures exhibited various and heterogeneous profiles of foliar distribution, leaf inclination and component species height. Nevertheless, most of the LIE was satisfactorily predicted by SIRASCA. Biased estimations were, however, observed for (1) grass species and (2) tall fescue-alfalfa mixtures grown at high density. Most of the discrepancies were due to vertical heterogeneities and were corrected by increasing the vertical description of canopies although, in practice, this would require time-consuming measurements. Conclusions The turbid medium analogy could be successfully used in a wide range of canopies. However, a more detailed description of the canopy is required for mixtures exhibiting vertical stratifications and inter-/intra-species foliage overlapping. Architectural models remain a relevant tool for studying light partitioning in intercropping systems that exhibit strong vertical heterogeneities. Moreover, these models offer the possibility to integrate the effects of microclimate variations on plant growth.

Cereals like maize, rice and fingermillet were more aggressive in intercropping system and they tended to have depressing effect on redgram. Intercropping of short duration pulses like blackgram and greengram and legume-oilseed crops like peanut and soybean with redgram showed balanced competitive abilities and proved more efficient in the system.

Yet, smallholders' adoption of soil conservation practices in Sub-Saharan Africa has not been adequately documented, especially in relation to the interdependence and temporal dynamics of adoption decisions. In this paper, we analyze the interdependence and temporal dynamics of smallholders' adoption of soil conservation practices, such as animal manure, crop residue retention, intercropping, and crop rotation in northern Nigeria. We use data from two rounds of a farm-household panel survey among maize-based farming households and estimate econometric models, including pooled multivariate probit and random effects ordered probit. We found that there is a significant positive correlation between the soil conservation practices, suggesting that adoption decisions for these practices are interrelated and the practices are considered complements by the farmers. We found evidence of inter-temporal variability in the adoption of soil conservation practices, which suggests that some farmers do switch in and out of these practices and may likely explain the often-reported variability in maize yields. Also, we found that the farmers' decisions to adopt soil conservation practices and the intensity of adoption are influenced by several factors, including farmer-, household-, farm-, institutional-, and biophysical-level factors. Yet, the factors that significantly influence the likelihood of adoption differ slightly from those that influence the intensity of adoption. Policy interventions to enhance the adoption intensity of conservation practices should strongly leverage important factors, such as contract farming, crop-livestock integration, and off-farm income diversification.

Organic C increased significantly when maize (25%), wheat (24%), mustard (19%), potato (17%), and rak mash (13%) were intercropped with sugarcane, while legume intercrops substantially increased Nt and available N. Increase in microbial respiration was greater where maize (42%), wheat (37%), or mustard (31%) were intercropped compared with pulse crops. Soil microbial biomass C accounted for 2.7 to 3.3% of C-org content and N-mic accounted for 2.6 to 3.7% of N-t under different intercropping conditions. A higher CO2 evolution rate and wider C-mic/N-mic ratios were recorded with cereal and mustard intercrops, whereas higher N mineralization was recorded with pulse intercrops. Results indicate that intercropping with pulse crops and incorporation of their labile C substrate improved N mineralization. The build up of the C pool and C-mic in the case of cereals, mustard, and potato intercropping should promote longterm stability.

FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Aboveground biomass; Root system; Semi-arid Loess Plateau; Triticum aestivum"	"SPRING WHEAT; INTERGENOTYPIC COMPETITION; CROPPING SYSTEMS; MIXED STANDS; ROOT SYSTEMS; GRAIN-YIELD; PRODUCTIVITY; DIVERSITY; BARLEY; STABILITY"	Use of mixtures of cultivars is an alternative to a monocultural crop and is considered one option to reduce the risks for producers. The objective of this study was to evaluate the grain yield and water use efficiency of a range of proportions of two winter wheat cultivars - an old landrace (Pingliang 40, PL) and a modern cultivar (Changwu 135, CNN). Field experiments were conducted in 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 at Changwu Agricultural Research Station on the Loess Plateau of China. Along with pure stands of each genotype, four mixed stands, 20% PL and 80% CW (PL2:CW8), 40% PL and 60% CW (PL4:CW8), 60% PL and 40% CW (PL6:CW4), 80% PL and 20% CW (PL8:CW2), were established in the first year and a single mixture of 50% PL and 50% CW (PL5:CW5) was established in the second year. The grain yield of the mixtures fell between the yields of the respective monocultures under mild drought condition in 2005, while the yield of PL5:CW5 was not significantly different from that of the modern cultivar, CW, but higher than that of the landrace PL under the more unfavorable conditions (moderate drought) of 2006 (P < 0.05). At the same proportions in the mixture, greater grain yield in PL than that in CW was associated with the higher spike density, higher grain number and larger grains. In 2005, the water use efficiency for grain (WUEg) of CW was significantly higher than that of PL, while the WUEg of the mixtures, except PL8:CW2, was intermediate between the WUEg of the two monocultures. In 2006, the WUEg of PL5:CW5 was higher than both PL and CW (P < 0.05). In the mixtures, plant height increased in PL, but was reduced in CW, while the flag leaf area increased in both cultivars. The mixtures increased the aboveground biomass, the root biomass was reduced, so that the root-to-shoot biomass ratio (R:S) and root respiration of the mixtures were lower than that of the monocultures (P < 0.05). For CW, the rate of leaf photosynthesis and leaf water use efficiency (WUBleaf) both decreased in mixture compared to the values in the monocultures. When the proportion in the-mixture was the same, the rate of photosynthesis of the flag leaf and WUEleaf of PL was significantly greater than CW. In 2006, the root biomass in the PL5:CW5 mixture decreased by 29% and 17% (P < 0.01) in the upper soil layer (0-0.4 m) and increased by 70% and 99% (P < 0.01) in the deep soil layer (0.6-1.0 m) in PL and CW, respectively, compared with the individual cultivars in pure stand. The mixtures had reduced water use before stem elongation, but increased water use from deep soil layers after anthesis. These results indicate that under unfavorable conditions, mixtures offer benefits in conserving soil water before stem elongation, and may provide opportunity for greater niche exploitation and more effective resource use efficiency, especially the extraction of water deep in the soil profile. We suggest that the use of a mixture of cultivars in a serious drought season will ensure greater availability of water after stem elongation stage, resulting in higher yields and WUEg than in cultivars grown as a monoculture.

Rapeseed was cultivated in low N conditions in monocrops using one (R) or two plants (RR) per pot and in mixtures with lupine, clover or vetch. The R monocrop was the most relevant control, intraspecific competition inducing a significant growth delay resulting in a significantly lower leaf number, in RR monocrop compared to R and the three mixtures considered. Plant biomass, and the N and S contents of rapeseed grown in mixtures were the same than those measured in R monocrop. Compared to the monocrop, the proportion of N derived from the atmosphere was increased by 34, 140 and 290% in lupine, clover and vetch, respectively when intercropped with rapeseed. In mixture with clover and lupine, the soil N pool at harvest was higher than in other treatments, while N export by crop was constant. Legumes suffered from competition for soil S resulting in a decrease of 40% in their S content compared to the monocrop. Compared to rapeseeds grown in R monocrop and in mixture with lupine and vetch, rapeseed mixed with clover showed significantly higher SPAD values in old leaves. In our conditions, mixing legumes with rapeseed is relevant to reduce N fertilization and improve nutrition and growth of rapeseed.

Dairy cows were offered GS or 2 intercrop silages prepared from wheat and either Magnus peas (MW, a tall-straw variety) or Setchey peas (SW, a short-straw variety) ad libitum. The respective intercrops were supplemented with 4 kg/d of a dairy concentrate (CP = 240 g/kg dry matter; MW4 and SW4), and the GS were supplemented with 4 (GS4) or 8 (GS8) kg/d of the same concentrate. The second experiment measured the forage DM intake, digestibility, rumen function, and microbial protein synthesis from the forages by offering them alone to 3, nonlactating cows ( 3 x 3 Latin square design with 21-d periods). Forage dry matter intake was greater in cows fed the intercrop silages than those fed GS. Milk production was greater in cows fed SW4 than those fed GS4 or MW4, but similar to cows fed GS8. Dietary treatment did not affect milk fat, protein, or lactose concentrations. The intercrops had greater N retention, and were more digestible than the GS, and these factors probably contributed to the greater forage DM intakes and greater milk production from the intercrop silages compared with the GS. Rumen volatile fatty acid concentrations were similar across forages, but urinary purine derivative excretion was greater in the cows fed the intercrop silages than the GS, suggesting that rumen microbial protein synthesis was enhanced by feeding the intercrops. In conclusion, similar milk yield and milk composition can be obtained by feeding SW and 4 kg of concentrates as that obtained with GS and 8 kg of concentrates. Feeding intercrop silages instead of GS with the same amount of concentrates increased forage intakes, N retention, and microbial protein synthesis."

Two experiments were carried out at each of two sites during 1993 and 1994. The first experiment investigated the effects of seeding soybean or lupin alone or in combination with one of three forages (annual ryegrass, Lolium multiflorum Lam.; perennial ryegrass, Lolium perenne L.; red clover, Trifolium pratense L.) with corn on the yield components of corn, soybean and lupin. The second experiment examined the effects of seeding date (simultaneous with corn or 3 weeks later) and number of rows of large seeded legumes (one or two) seeded between the corn rows. Corn grain yield was generally not affected by any intercrop treatment, although in 1993 some simultaneously seeded treatments resulted in decreased yields. Soybean grain yield was decreased by most treatments, although some simultaneous seedings produced yields similar to soybean monocrops. Lupin grew poorly as an intercrop component, producing little or no grain. Corn harvest index was not affected by any intercrop treatments. Seeding corn and large-seeded legumes simultaneously resulted in decreases in corn hundred seed weights by as much as 6.6 g compared with the monocropped corn. In 1993 (a year with normal precipitation levels), the hundred seed weight and number of seeds per soybean pod were decreased by intercropping, although the harvest index was not affected. In a high precipitation year (1994), the soybean harvest index was decreased by intercropping, but not the seed components. The underseeded forages, annual ryegrass, perennial ryegrass and red clover, had no effect on yields or yield components of the other intercropped species. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The aim of this work was to identify nematodes that are good biological indicators in maize crops under different management systems, and to establish the impact levels of these systems. Soil samples were collected over a 3-year period at a depth of 0.0-0.3 m in areas under six different management systems for maize (Zea mays) monoculture, and intercropped maize and Canavalia ensiformis. Six areas of native vegetation were also assessed to provide a reference for ecological balance. After identification and counting, nematode communities were characterised according to abundance (total and relative), diversity (identified genera and diversity indexes), trophic structure and ecological maturity (disturbance indexes). Nematodes proved to be good ecological indicators, responding to the systems employed. Intercropping maize and Canavalia ensiformis in at least one assessment year reduced disruption and increased nematode diversity, which were both verified based on specific indexes. It was also observed that the maize monoculture increased disruption leading to a drop in nematode fauna diversity and an increase in the incidence of plant-feeding nematodes.

The aim of this experiment was to determine the effect of root excretions of spring cereal seedlings on seed germination of legumes seeds. The experiment carried out in March and April 2009 under laboratory conditions, in the Institute of Soil Science and Plant Cultivation, State Research Institute in Pulawy, involved oat (Avena), barley (Hordeum), wheat (Triticum), triticale (x Triticosecale), pea (Pisum sativum), common vetch (Vicia), yellow lupine (Lupinus luteus) and blue lupine (Lupinus angustifolius). Two concentrations of excretions were applied: 1 corresponding to the effect of one cereal seedling on one legume seed, II corresponding to the effect of five cereal seedlings on one legume seed. The effects were examined after 4 and 8 days. Root excretions applied in a lower concentration usually had no effect on the tested parameters characterizing the germination of legume seeds. However, the stimulating effect of barley excretions on the length of the pea and vetch rootlet was recorded as well as the effect of triticale on the length of rootlet and the weight and length of germ in pea. Favorable effect of triticale excretions was found both after 4 and 8 days from their application. Cereal excretions with higher concentrations, except for oat excretions, had mostly an inhibitory and in some cases even destructive effect on seed germination. No favorable effect of wheat excretions on seeds of both legume species was observed on any treatments.

J	"Gu, CF; van der Werf, W; Bastiaans, L"				"Gu, Chunfeng; van der Werf, Wopke; Bastiaans, Lammert"			A predictive model for weed biomass in annual intercropping	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Intercropping; Hyperbolic equation; Complementarity; Selection; Plant competition; Weed"	"RESOURCE USE; SUPPRESSION; DENSITY; COMPETITION; YIELD; WHEAT; PEA; PRODUCTIVITY; SELECTION; MIXTURES"	Intercropping has frequently been reported to provide good weed suppression. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the weed biomass in annual intercropping systems can be adequately forecasted based on the weed biomass obtained in pure stands of the component crop species. The aim of this analysis was to enlarge the understanding on the weed suppressive ability of intercrops, and specifically to shed light on the relevance of the mechanisms at the basis of weed suppression in intercrops and the factors governing this weed suppression. Based on a literature survey, a dataset covering 76 experiments, a total of 35 different crop species combinations and a total of 339 records was composed, with each record containing weed biomass of the intercrop as well as that of pure stands of the component species. Three models were evaluated and compared using the dataset. The first two models, the arithmetic mean (model 1) and the weighted arithmetic mean (model 2a and 2b) of the weed biomasses obtained in pure stand, resulted in a systematic overestimation of weed biomass in intercrops. This result confirms that the ability of intercrops to suppress weeds is in general well developed. A third model was constructed based on an extended version of the hyperbolic yield-density equation. Mathematical elaboration of this equation suggests the weed biomass in intercrops to be equal to the weighted harmonic mean of weed biomasses in pure stands (model 3), whereby weighting is based on the relative densities of the component species in intercrops. Comparison between observed and predicted data showed that the model accurately predicted weed biomass of simultaneous intercrops in mixed and row design. The harmonic mean indicates that weed biomass in intercrops is the outcome of the joint competitive effect of the component species, whereby the more strongly weed suppressive species contributes a more than proportional share. Such dominance of one of the species is generally referred to as selection. For intercrops with a less intimate entanglement of the two component species, either due to temporal (relay intercrops) or spatial (strip intercrops) separation, the harmonic mean tended to underestimate observed weed biomass. A contribution of complementarity, following from niche differentiation or facilitation between component species, to the weed suppression of intercrops is not accounted for in the harmonic mean model. The high accuracy of the predictions thus suggests that the density and the selection effect are the main mechanisms responsible for weed suppression in intercrops. Choice of component species, their mixing ratio and the total plant density of the intercrop were all shown to clearly influence the weed suppressive ability of the intercrop. With a prominent role of the selection effect, care should be taken that an overemphasis on weed suppressive ability in the design of intercropping systems should not result in the poorer weed suppressive species being outcompeted. Another important implication of the finding that weed biomass in intercrops can be accurately predicted based on weed biomass in pure stands of the component species is that variety selection for intercrops with improved weed suppression can simply be confined to variety selection in pure stands.

We summarize data regarding various aspects of the nesting ecology of the American black duck (Anas rubripes) (n = 812 nests). Mean laying date, average clutch size, and apparent nesting success did not differ among years (P > 0.05). Black ducks nested earlier on islands (mean Julian date 120.0 vs. 121.3; P = 0.03), but mean clutch size and nesting success on islands did not differ from those on the mainland (P > 0.05). Among mainland-nesting black ducks, those nesting in mixed stands of trees and bushes initiated nests almost 10 days earlier than those nesting in the two other types of nest cover (mean Julian date 124.0 vs. 134.4 and 139.6). Black ducks nesting in such habitats as woodlots, peat bogs, or shrubland laid a larger number of eggs than those nesting in the two other habitat types (mean 9.7 vs. 8.8 and 9.4). Finally, we observed that nesting success of ducks nesting in woodlots, peat bogs, and shrubland and in mixed stands of trees and bushes or of herbaceous plants and shrubs was up to three times higher than at other sites (P less than or equal to 0.05). We conclude that in addition to protection and restoration of existing islands, more emphasis should be placed on conserving peat bogs, coniferous woodlots, and shrubland, because they also constitute good mainland-nesting habitat for black ducks along the St. Lawrence estuary."

Objectives were to (1) determine the adequacy of protected or unprotected sole-crop evaluations of genotypes for unprotected intercrop farming systems, and (2) determine if specific plant growth habits or growth durations are advantageous under intercropping. Protected sole-crop yields were not correlated with unprotected intercrop yields in any of the four experiments, but unprotected sole-crop yields were consistently positively correlated with unprotected intercrop yields, and were significant in three of five trials. Differences in field tolerance to insect pests among the lines partially accounted for these correlations. Significant or highly significant positive correlations were observed between protected sole-crop and protected intercrop yields in three of four trials. While protected sole-crop evaluations would be useful in identifying lines for a protected intercrop farming system, such procedures would fail to identify lines best suited to unprotected intercrop systems used by the majority of farmers. Early generation nurseries could be conducted using unprotected sole-crops to evaluate tolerance to pests, but final evaluations should be conducted with the unprotected intercropping system practiced by most farmers. No particular growth habit or developmental pattern appeared to be particularly advantageous under the intercropping system investigated.

Conservationist managements favor the soil physical quality and, consequently, the efficiency of soil water consumption. The objective of this study was to evaluate the soil physical quality, as a function of the conservation managements adopted, by using physical soil quality indicators, and to verify its relation with the soil organic carbon stocks and the grain yield in the Cerrado of Minas Gerais state, Brazil. For that, six treatments were evaluated: soybean (1) and maize (2) monocultures crop systems at medium level of investment in soil fertilization, soybean-maize crop succession at medium (3) and high (6) level of investment in soil fertilization, and crop succession of soybean-maize and intercropped with Urochloa ruziziensis at medium (4) and high (5) level of investment in soil fertilization, during the initial stage of no-tillage system. The treatments 3, 4, 5 and 6 showed improvement in the soil physical quality in relation to the monoculture. Pore distribution and soil organic carbon content were the main responsible for discriminating the intensified crop systems. Attributes related to water availability were important for plant growth in the 0-0.05 m layer, while for the 0.15-0.20 m layer, the highest soil aeration stood out. Productivity did not correlate with the evaluated attributes.

Data were taken from an experiment carried out at the Institute of Animal Science where the intercropping of different species (soybean, maize and dolichos) were evaluated at sowing time in a Brachiaria purpurascens cv. Aguada grassland. The cost of each treatment using a random block design wits determined. A technical and economical analysis using the ANALIT computer programme was carried out to estimate the milk production potentials from a feeding system with pastures plus forages from the intercropping. Also the possible number of animals to be fed according to the availabilities per treatment was considered and the expected economical entry in terms of the estimated milk yield was calculated. Maize intercropping showed the lowest cost/t of DM, while dolichos and soybean offer the greatest possibilities for producing milk and feeding a greater number of animals, showing an increase higher than 3 litres/cow/day with respect to the alternative of supplying pasture alone in the diets. These treatments also contributed with the highest economical profit. Production systems based on combinations of pastures plus intercropped forage cultures demonstrated that it could offer perspectives for improving cattle rations and that the application of mathematical and economical techniques could contribute to optimizing the use of the available resources, and at the same time it may facilitate the planning of productive and economical efforts.

Cowpea (Vigna unguiculataL.Walp) is often intercropped with major cereal crops, maize (Zea maysL.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolorL. Moench) and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum). Here we conducted a systematic literature review on cowpea intercropped with maize, sorghum or pearl millet reported in sub-Saharan Africa with the objectives (i) to determine yield and productivity of component crops and (ii) to quantify biological N-2-fixation in sole or intercrops. We retrieved 60 unique publications combining 1196, 998 and 25 observations of yields, land productivity and N-2-fixation, respectively, for crops grown as intercrops and monocrops. The major results are as follows: (1) land productivity of cowpea intercropped with maize, sorghum and pearl millet is favourable, with average land equivalent ratios of 1.42 +/- 0.47, 1.26 +/- 0.35 and 1.30 +/- 0.32, respectively; (2) no significant differences between the proportion of nitrogen derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa) for sole or intercropped cowpea were found, with average values of 56.00 +/- 4.89 and 46.62 +/- 7.05, respectively; (3) however, the total amount of fixed nitrogen was higher in cowpea monocropping systems due to higher biomass production; nitrogen fixation was 57 kg N ha(-1)and 36 kg N ha(-1)in monocrops and intercrops respectively. We conclude that cereal-cowpea intercropping is a pathway for intensification for the low nutrient input systems of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Our review also suggests potential for improvement of these systems, based on the choice of the associated varieties, planting patterns and sowing time, cowpea leaf harvesting as a vegetable, and fertilization."

Brachiaria species influence nitrate transport in soil by modifying soil structure with their root system	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							"RAY COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; CROPPING SYSTEMS; WATER RETENTION; ORGANIC-MATTER; ARCHITECTURE; TILLAGE; MAIZE; DEFORMATION; ROTATIONS; NITROGEN"	Leaching of nitrate from fertilisers diminishes nitrogen use efficiency (the portion of nitrogen used by a plant) and is a major source of agricultural pollution. To improve nitrogen capture, grasses such as brachiaria are increasingly used, especially in South America and Africa, as a cover crop, either via intercropping or in rotation. However, the complex interactions between soil structure, nitrogen and the root systems of maize and different species of forage grasses remain poorly understood. This study explored how soil structure modification by the roots of maize (Zea maize), palisade grass (Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu) and ruzigrass (Brachiaria ruziziensis) affected nitrate leaching and retention, measured via chemical breakthrough curves. All plants were found to increase the rate of nitrate transport suggesting root systems increase the tendency for preferential flow. The greater density of fine roots produced by palisade grass, subtly decreased nitrate leaching potential through increased complexity of the soil pore network assessed with X-ray Computed Tomography. A dominance of larger roots in ruzigrass and maize increased nitrate loss through enhanced solute flow bypassing the soil matrix. These results suggest palisade grass could be a more efficient nitrate catch crop than ruzigrass (the most extensively used currently in countries such as Brazil) due to retardation in solute flow associated with the fine root system and the complex pore network.

The worldwide absolute yield gain of intercropping as compared with sole crops has not been analysed. We therefore performed a global meta-analysis to quantify the effect of intercropping on the yield gain, exploring the effects of crop species combinations, temporal and spatial arrangements, and fertilizer input. We found that the absolute yield gains, compared with monocultures, were the greatest for mixtures of maize with short-grain cereals or legumes that had substantial temporal niche differentiation from maize, when grown with high nutrient inputs, and using multirow strips of each species. This approach, commonly practised in China, provided yield gains that were (in an absolute sense) about four times as large as those in another, low-input intercropping strategy, commonly practised outside China. The alternative intercropping strategy consisted of growing mixtures of short-stature crop species, often as full mixtures, with the same growing period and with low to moderate nutrient inputs. Both the low- and high-yield intercropping strategies saved 16-29% of the land and 19-36% of the fertilizer compared with monocultures grown under the same management as the intercrop. The two syndromes of production in intercropping uncovered by this meta-analysis show that intercropping offers opportunities for the sustainable intensification of both high- and low-input agriculture. Intercropping can provide for agricultural intensification within a sustainable footprint. This study of Chinese methods finds yields four times greater than intercropping outside China with less land and fertilizer use.

Field trails were organized in randomized complete blocks design with four replications at the end of November in 2014 and 2015. Grain yields in the intercropped pea and wheat were less than sole crops. Increasing pea rate in the mixture seeding provided good competition with wheat. The highest grain yield of intercropped pea was found in the intercrops including 85% of pea seeds in alternate row in both years and combined years. Total grain yield of intercrops was higher than sole crop pea, but it was lower than sole crop wheat. Total grain yield of intercrops including 50 % pea at the same row was higher when compared to the other intercrops in both of years and combined years. On the other hand, it was found that generally, LER value for grain in the intercrops was greater than 1 and intercrops use environmental sources such as water, soil, and light for plant growth factors more efficiently than the sole crops for grain production.

Effect of intercropping vetch (Vicia sativa L.), field pea (Pisum sativum L.) and triticale (X Triticosecale) on dry-matter yield, nutritive and ensiling characteristics when harvested at two growth stages	GRASS AND FORAGE SCIENCE			English	Article						"cereal-legume intercrops; field pea; forage; ruminant; silage; triticale; vetch"	"IN-VITRO-DIGESTIBILITY; BI-CROP SILAGES; WHEAT INTERCROPS; MILK-PRODUCTION; FERMENTATION CHARACTERISTICS; GRASS-SILAGE; COMMON VETCH; DAIRY-COWS; FORAGE; QUALITY"	This study aimed to investigate the effects of growth stage and legume proportion on the nutritive and ensiling characteristics of triticale-pea-vetch intercrop mixtures. The three-species mixtures were sown at three seeding ratios to produce different legume proportions (low, medium and high proportions) and harvested at two growth stages. The six resulting forages were subsequently ensiled in mini-silos. Forage dry-matter (DM) yield, nutritive characteristics of fresh and ensiled mixtures and fermentation characteristics of silages were determined. Forage DM yield almost tripled between early-stage harvest and late-stage harvest. Nutritive characteristics of fresh and ensiled mixtures were affected by both growth stage and legume proportion: crude protein concentration and pepsin-cellulase digestibility decreased whereas NDF and ADF concentrations increased as growth stage advanced. Crude protein concentration and pepsin-cellulase digestibility were higher for the high-legume treatment at both growth stages. All mixtures ensiled well, as indicated by low pH and high lactic and acetic acids contents. However, all silages had high soluble nitrogen and ammonia concentrations. This study showed that triticale-peavetch silages hold good potential net energy supply value for ruminants, especially at early-stage growth and when legume proportion increases. However, protein value has to be improved by reducing protein breakdown during ensiling.

However, the proportion of each species in the mixture at harvest is highly variable. The aim of this study was to test whether the timing of small application of N fertilizer is an effective way of influencing the dynamic interactions between species during crop growth and affecting the percentage of each species in the biomass of the mixture without greatly disturbing N-2 fixation. The influence of timing of nitrogen fertilization in pea-wheat intercrops was studied as regards (i) the dynamics of crop growth, (ii) nitrogen acquisition of each species, (iii) the inhibition and recovery of symbiotic N-2 fixation (SNF) after N application and (iv) final performance (yield, % of wheat. grain protein content). This was assessed in winter pea-wheat (Pisum sativum L-Triticum aestivum L) intercrops in 2007 and 2008 at two locations in France. Whatever the stage of application. N fertilizer tended to increase wheat growth and to decrease pea growth. N fertilization (applied once at different dates from tillering to the end of stem elongation) delayed the decrease in the contribution of wheat to total biomass and maintained the competitive ability of wheat over pea for longer than in unfertilized intercrops. N acquisition dynamics and N sharing between the two species were modified by N fertilization and its timing. Crop conditions at the time of N application (growth and phenology of each species, and their proportions in the intercrop biomass) greatly influenced intercrop response to N fertilization. Partitioning between species of soil and fertilizer N was correlated with the proportion of wheat in the total intercrop biomass observed at the date of N application. Short-term inhibition of nitrates on SNF was shown during the few days after N application, whatever its date. SNF recovery after N applications was observed only until pea flowering, but was prematurely stopped by N fertilization after this stage. The effect of N fertilization on the amount of fixed N-2 at harvest was correlated with pea biomass. N fertilization affects N-2 fixation mainly by affecting crop growth rather than %Ndfa in pea-wheat intercrops. In conclusion, N fertilization could be used as a tool to enhance the contribution of wheat in the intercrop biomass but may reduce the amount of fixed N-2 in the intercrop by decreasing pea biomass.

However, scanty information is available on soil and nutrient losses under different crop covers in a vertisol of Central India. Thus, a field experiment was conducted for 4 years (2010-2013) to study the effect of different crop cover combinations on soil and nutrient losses through runoff in a vertisol. Materials and methods Very limited information is available on runoff, soil, and nutrient losses under different vegetative covers in a rainfed vertisol. Thus, the hypothesis of the study was to evaluate if different crop cover combinations would have greater impact on reducing soil and nutrient losses compared to control plots in a vertisol. This experiment consisted of seven treatment combinations of crop covers namely soybean (Glycine max) (CC1), maize (Zea mays) (CC2), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) (CC3), soybean (Glycine max) + maize (Zea mays) - 1:1 (CC4), soybean (Glycine ma x)) + pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) -2:1 (CC5), maize (Zea mays) + pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) - 1:1 (CC6), and cultivated fallow (CC7). The plot size was 10 x 5 m with 1% slope, and runoff and soil loss were measured using multi-slot devisor. All treatments were arranged in a randomized block design with three replications. Results and discussion Results demonstrated that the runoff and soil loss were significantly (p < 0.05) higher (289 mm and 3.92 Mg ha(-1)) under cultivated fallow than those in cropped plots. Among various crop covers, sole pigeon pea (CC3) recorded significantly higher runoff and soil loss (257 mm and 3.16 Mg ha(-1)) followed by that under sole maize (CC2) (235 mm and 2.85 Mg ha(-1)) and the intercrops were in the order of maize + pigeon pea (211 mm and 2.47 Mg ha(-1)) followed by soybean + maize (202 mm and 2.38 Mg ha(-1)), and soybean + pigeon pea (195 mm and 2.15 Mg ha(-1)). The lowest runoff and soil loss were recorded under soybean sole crop (194 mm and 2.27 Mg ha(-1)). The data on nutrient losses indicated that the highest losses of soil organic carbon (SOC) (25.83 kg ha(-1)), total nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) (7.76, 0.96, 32.5 kg ha(-1)) were recorded in cultivated fallow (CC7) as compared to those from sole and intercrop treatments. However, sole soybean and its intercrops recorded the minimum losses of SOC and total N, P, and K, whereas the maximum losses of nutrients were recorded under pigeon pea (CC3). The system productivity in terms of soybean grain equivalent yield (SGEY) was higher (p < 0.05) from maize + pigeon pea (3358 kg ha(-1)) followed by that for soybean + pigeon pea (2191 kg ha(-1)) as compared to sole soybean. Therefore, maize + pigeon pea (1:1) intercropping is the promising option in reducing runoff, soil-nutrient losses, and enhancing crop productivity in the hot sub-humid eco-region. Conclusions Study results highlight the need for maintenance of suitable vegetative cover as of great significance to diffusing the erosive energy of heavy rains and also safe guarding the soil resource from degradation by water erosion in vertisols.

The benefits have been investigated by measuring biological N fixation and production, but have seldom been evaluated based on plant N acquisition strategies. Methods Zea mays and Glycine max were planted under three cropping regimes, i.e., monocropping or intercropping the two species in the same hole (sowing at the same point) or separated at a certain distance. After 50 days, an in situ N-15-labeling experiment was carried out to assess N uptake preference (NO3- or NH4+). Results Intercropping in the same hole increased plant density and total biomass. Both species showed a strong preference for NO3- over NH4+. Intercropping in the same hole increased and decreased NO3- uptake by Z. mays and G. max, respectively. Z. mays significantly increased NH4+ uptake when intercropped in the same hole or at a certain distance. Conclusions Z. mays and G. max showed strong preference for NO3- over NH4+ irrespective of cropping regime. Intercropping did not influence N preference but altered uptake rates of both N forms. Thus, intercropping in the same hole is a useful practice in agricultural systems because it can increase total biomass and N uptake by Z. mays.

This study aimed to evaluate the tillering and dry matter yield of two brachiaria species under different depths of seed deposition intercropped with corn in integrated crop-livestock production in the Cerrado region. The experiment was conducted in no-tillage system in Selviria - Mato Grosso do Sul State, in an Oxisol, clayey. The experimental design was randomized blocks in factorial scheme 2x3, with four replications. The treatments were two species of brachiaria (Brachiaria brizantha cv. 'Marandu' and Brachiaria ruziziensis), whose seeds were mixed with fertilizer from corn, and three different depths (8, 10 and 16cm) of fertilizer deposition. The deposition of brachiarias seeds to 16cm depth resulted in lower stand of tillers and dry matter yield. The filtering of forages was influenced by the phases of the corn cycle, with trend towards stabilization in closing between the lines of culture and taken up in the issuance of tillers at the end of the cycle.

Millsp.] intercropped with greengram (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) under varying levels of fertility and plant population. Uniform planting of pigeonpea at 60 cm apart rows intercropped with greengram at optimum plant population and recommended fertilization (30 kg N/ha + 60 kg P2O5/ha for pigeonpea and 20 kg N/ha + 40 kg P2O5/ha for greengram) separately drilled gave higher grain yield (15.44 q/ha pigeonpea + 8.30 q/ha greengram) than either sole pigeonpea (16.84 q/ha) or greengram (8.92 q/ha) or rest of the intercropping systems followed. Application of fertilizer drilled separately, by and large, proved advantageous over the fertilizer mixed together for both crops in intercropping system. Higher land-equivalent ratio (1.85) also further established the superiority of former intercropping system. Intercropping of pigeonpea with greengram appreciably increased the wheat yield (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori & Paol.) over the yield obtained after pigeonpea sole.

Effect of whole-crop pea (Pisum sativum L.) silages differing in condensed tannin content as a substitute for grass silage and soybean meal on the performance, metabolism, and carcass characteristics of lambs	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						"metabolism; performance; silage; tannin; whole-crop peas"	"DIFFERENT PROTEIN SUPPLEMENTS; MILK-PRODUCTION; FORAGE LEGUMES; DAIRY-COWS; WHEAT INTERCROPS; FINISHING LAMBS; DIETARY ENERGY; CV BLANCA; IN-VIVO; RUMINANTS"	Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of inclusion of whole-crop pea (WCP) silages, differing in condensed tannin content, as a substitute for grass silage (GS) and soybean meal on lamb metabolism, performance, plasma metabolites, digestibility, and carcass characteristics. In both experiments lambs were offered either solely GS or a 50: 50 mix on a DM basis of GS with either low-tannin (LTPS) or high-tannin (HTPS) pea silage ad libitum. Each forage mix was fed with either 400 g/d of low-protein (LP) concentrate or 400 g/d of LP with an additional 200 g/d of pelletized soybean meal (HP), resulting in 6 dietary treatments. Experiment 1 examined the effects of the diets on metabolism, digestibility, and N balance using 6 lambs in 4 periods of 21 d in an incomplete crossover design. Experiment 2 used 48 lambs and examined the effects of the diets on ADG, plasma metabolites, and carcass characteristics over 56 d. Both experiments were analyzed using a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. In Exp. 1, lambs offered the LTPS diets had a greater (P < 0.05) digestibility of DM and OM than those offered the GS diets. Lambs offered the WCP silages had an increased (P < 0.05) N intake, N output, and digestibility of GE compared with those offered GS. Mean N digestibility was greatest (P < 0.05) in lambs offered LTPS. Lambs offered HP diets had increased (P < 0.001) digestibility of DM, OM, GE and N, and N-intake, output, retention, and digestibility compared with those offered the LP diets. In Exp. 2, there was no effect (P > 0.05) of forage type on intake, slaughter BW, or feed conversion efficiency (FCE). However, lambs offered the LTPS had a greater (P < 0.05) ADG than those offered the GS diets. Feeding diets containing HP increased (P < 0.001) total DMI, slaughter BW, ADG, and FCE. Lambs offered the WCP had a greater (P < 0.05) plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate and urea concentration compared with those offered the GS diets. Feeding lambs HP diets increased (P < 0.05) plasma urea and total protein. Forage mix had no effect (P > 0.05) on carcass composition except for fat depth, which was greater (P < 0.05) in lambs offered WCP silage. Diets containing the HP increased (P < 0.05) carcass weight, hind leg circumference, chop dimensions, and kidney weight. It was concluded that lambs offered LTPS performed better than those offered GS and that LTPS has a concentrate sparing effect. Additionally, the increased tannin concentration in HTPS did not increase performance over lambs offered either GS or LTPS.	"[Hart, K. J.; Sinclair, L. A.; Wilkinson, R. G.; Huntington, J.

Resistant maize after a trap crop increased the net benefit over the two Cropping seasons in both trials by over 100% over farmer practice. However, in the second set of trials there was no significant increase in productivity between a trap crop followed by Shiga resistant maize, and a trap crop followed by local maize especially where legume intercropping and fertilizer bad been applied in the farmer practice. There was also no increase in productivity between two years traditional cereal cropping and one year's local maize followed by Striga resistant maize. This indicates the importance of a legume trap crop in the first year in order to ensure high productivity in the second year, regardless of variety Up to 20% of farmers obtained higher productivity from their own practices, notably intercropping of cereals with legumes and use of inorganic fertilizers. Leguminous trap crops and Striga a resistant maize, together with two key management practices (increased soybean planting density and hand-roguing) were seen to be spreading both within and beyond the research villages, indicating that farmers see the economic benefits of controlling Striga. Survey findings show that explaining the reasons why control practices work can greatly increase the adoption of these practices. Wider adoption of Striga control will therefore require an extension approach that provides this training as well as encouraging farmers to experiment and adapt Striga control options for their local farming systems.

In the context of agricultural research, the analysis of yield stability has been largely confined to multienvironment trials of crop cultivars. This review emphasizes that methods for comparing the stability of cultivars can also be used for comparing different agronomic treatments in general, of which cultivars are but a special case. Throughout the paper, different agronomic treatments are referred to as cropping systems. Some of the methods useful for stability analysis of cropping systems are discussed and a brief review of applications of these methods is given. The paper puts different stability measures into a unifying mixed model perspective.

Purpose Increasing crop yield to ensure global food security while decreasing carbon footprint (CF) is a challenge for sustainable agriculture. Although intercropping is suggested as a potential pathway in this regard, the balance between yield advantage and CF is unclear, especially under different nitrogen (N) application rates. Methods A two-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of oat/sunflower intercropping and N application rates (0, 50, 100, and 150 kg ha(-1)) on yield advantages, N uptake, and CF. Results The overall land equivalent ratio of oat/sunflower intercropping decreased from 1.33 to 1.07 with increasing N fertilization, which implies the potential N reduction to maintain crop yield. Without fertilization, the yield advantage of intercropping was 28-32% and 18-47% higher for oat and sunflower, respectively compared with corresponding monocultures. However, this yield advantage decreased with increasing fertilization, especially for oat. The border rows contributed more than one-third of the yield for intercropped oat without N fertilization, but their contribution decreased with increasing N fertilization. However, the contribution of border rows to intercropped sunflower yield was independent of N fertilization and remained around 69-75%. Overall, oat/sunflower relay strip intercropping maximizes the productivity by border row effects due to reduced N fertilization demand. Furthermore, intercropping decreased the CF relative to monoculture, especially without N fertilization. Conclusion Intercropping can act as a win-win strategy for sustainable agriculture in Northwest China with higher productivity and lower carbon footprint.

The promotion of natural resource management (NRM) technologies is widely seen as more sustainable to increase agricultural productivity and food security. Relatively little is known about how input subsidies affect farmers' decisions to adopt NRM technologies. There are concerns of incompatibility, because NRM technologies are one strategy to reduce the use of external inputs in intensive production systems. However, in smallholder systems of Africa, where the average use of external inputs is low, there may possibly be interesting complementarities. Here, we analyse the situation of Malawi's Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP). Using panel data from smallholder farm households, we develop a multivariate probit model and examine how FISP participation affects farmers' decisions to adopt various NRM technologies, such as intercropping of maize with legumes, use of organic manure, water conservation practices and vegetative strips. As expected, FISP increases the use of inorganic fertilizer and improved maize seeds. Yet, we also observe a positive association between FISP and the adoption of certain NRM technologies. For other NRM technologies, we find no significant effect. We conclude that input subsidies and the promotion of NRM technologies can be compatible strategies.

Subba"			Legume effect for enhancing productivity and nutrient use-efficiency in major cropping systems - An Indian perspective: A review	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE			English	Article						"alley cropping; cropping system; dry land; intercrop; irrigated; legume; nutrient use-efficiency; rainfed; residual fertility"	"MAIZE ZEA-MAYS; FERTILIZER NITROGEN; PHOSPHORUS; GRAIN; MANAGEMENT; PIGEONPEA; ECONOMY; CROPS; PURE; SOIL"	Inclusion of legumes in the cropping system has been known since times immemorial. Legume is a natural mini-nitrogen manufacturing factory in the field and the farmers by growing these crops can play a vital role in increasing indigenous nitrogen production. Legume help in solubilizing insoluble P in soil, improving the soil physical environment, increasing soil microbial activity, and restoring organic matter, and also has smothering effect on weed. The carryover of N derived from legume grown, either in crop sequence or in intercropping system for succeeding crops, is also important. In a country like India, where the average consumption of plant nutrients from chemical fertilizers on national basis is very low, the scope for exploiting direct and residual fertility due to legumes has obviously a great potential. This article deals with the beneficial effect of important legumes on increasing productivity and nutrient use-efficiency in various systems. Sorghum, pearl millet, maize, and castor are mainstay in dry lands and marginal and sub-marginal lands. Sorghum yield increased when sown after cowpea, green gram, and groundnut. Grain legumes like groundnut or cowpea provide an equivalent to 60 kg N ha on the Subsequent crop of pearl millet. Various studies have shown that among legume/cereal intercropping system, the combination of maize/pigeon pea is considered to be highly suitable with a minimum competition for nutrients, while legume/legume intercropping system, pigeon pea/groundnut system is the most efficient one in terms of resource use-efficiency. In alley cropping system, Leucaena leucocephala (Subabul) prunings provide N to the extent of 75 kg, which benefits the intercrop castor and sorghum. Nitrogen economy through intercropped legume is still a researchable issue because the key point for leguminous crop grown in intercropping system is the problem of nodulation. Incorporation of whole plant of summer green gram/black grain into soil (after picking pods) before transplanting rice resulted in the economizing (40-60 kg N ha(-1), 30 kg P2O5, and 15 kg K2O per ha) of rice in rice-wheat system. Similarly, 6-8 weeks old green manure crop of sunhemp or dhaincha accumulates about 3-4 t ha(-1) dry matter and 100-120 kg N ha(-1) which, when incorporated in situ, supplements up to 50% of the total N requirement of rice. Legumes with indeterminate growth are more efficient in N, fixation than determinate types. Fodder legumes in general are more potent in increasing the productivity of succeeding cereals. The carryover of N for succeeding crops may be 60-120 kg in berseem, 75 kg in Indian clover, 9 t, 75 kg in cluster bean, 35-60 kg in fodder cowpea, 68 kg in chickpea, 55 kg in black gram, 54-58 kg in groundnut, 50-51 kg in soybean, 50 kg in Lathyrus, and 36-42 kg per ha in pigeon pea. Direct and residual effect of partially acidulated material and mixture of rock phosphate + single superphosphate were observed to be better when these were applied to green gram in winter season than to rice in rainy season simply because of legume effect.

In this study, root responses in maize (Zea mays)/soybean (Glycine max) intercropping systems recognized soil phosphorus (P) status and neighboring plants in the field. Compared to self culture, the maize variety GZ1 intercropping with soybean HX3 grew much better on low P, but not in another maize variety, NE1. This genotypic response decreased with increasing distance between plants, suggesting that root interactions were important. We further conducted a detailed and quantitative study of root behavior in situ using a gel system to reconstruct the three-dimensional root architecture. The results showed that plant roots could integrate information on P status and root behavior of neighboring plants. When intercropped with its kin, maize or soybean roots grew close to each other. However, when maize GZ1 was grown with soybean HX3, the roots on each plant tended to avoid each other and became shallower on stratified P supply, but not found with maize NE1. Furthermore, root behavior in gel was highly correlated to shoot biomass and P content for field-grown plants grown in close proximity. This study provides new insights into the dynamics and complexity of root behavior and kin recognition among crop species in response to nutrient status and neighboring plants. These findings also indicate that root behavior not only depends on neighbor recognition but also on a coordinated response to soil P status, which could be the underlying cause for the different growth responses in the field.

In fields, the two crops of soybean (Glycine max L.) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), which have nitrogen-fixing capacity (NFC), are generally used to intercrop with corn to improve plant physiology and production ability of corn even under fertilizer reduction. To explore a more scientific and reasonable way to plant corn, and simultaneously reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, the impacts of corn intercropping with two NFC crops (including soybean and peanut) and the a non-NFC crop (i.e., millet (Setaria italica)) through five planting patterns, including three intercropping patterns (2 corn rows to 2, 3, and 4 NFC-crop rows or 2, 4, and 6 millet rows) and two sole crop patterns of corn and soybean, peanut, or millet under normal (600 kg/ha) and reduced (375 kg/ha) levels of NPK (N:P2O5:K2O = 15:15:15) fertilization levels on the activity of N-metabolism-related enzymes in corn rhizosphere soil and corn leaves, and plant biomass and yield of corn were researched in this study. The results showed that fertilizer reduction significantly decreased the plant biomass and grain yield of the sole crop corn. The intercropping type and planting pattern both had significant effects on the activities of N-metabolism-related enzyme of soil alkaline protease (S-ALPT), and glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase (GOGAT), glutamate synthetase (GS), and nitrate reductase (NR) in the leaves of corn plants. The intercropping type of corn with soybean through the planting pattern of 2 corn rows to 4 soybean rows significantly improved the activities of N-metabolism-related enzymes in soil and corn leaves even under the fertilizer reduction. The intercropping pattern of corn-soybean was the most beneficial to increase the total nitrogen content in soil and corn leaves. In addition, the intercropping significantly increased the soil microbial diversity under normal fertilizer. Furthermore, fertilizer reduction significantly increased soil microbial diversity of the corn sole crop. Therefore, it is concluded that for corn in intercropping systems, the best and the worst companion crop were, respectively, soybean and millet.

The non-host plant, molasses grass (Melinis minutiflora Beauv. (Poaceae)), is reported to produce some volatile compounds known to be attractive to some parasitoid species. The studies were conducted to explore the possibility of intercropping stemborer host plants with molasses grass in order to enhance the foraging activity of D. busseolae in such a diversified agro-ecosystem. Olfactometric bioassays showed that volatiles from the host plants maize, Zea mays L., and sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) (Poaceae), were attractive to the parasitoid. Infested host plants were the most attractive. Volatiles from molasses grass were repellent to the parasitoid. Further tests showed that volatiles from infested and uninfested host plants alone were preferred over those from infested and uninfested host plants combined with the non-host plant, molasses grass. In dual choice tests, the parasitoid did not discriminate between volatiles from maize infested by either of the two herbivore species, C. partellus or Busseola fusca Fuller (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Volatiles from sorghum infested by C. partellus were preferred over those from C. partellus infested maize. The study showed that the pupal parasitoid D. busseolae uses plant volatiles during foraging, with those from the plant-herbivore complex being the most attractive. The fact that volatiles from molasses grass were deterrent to the parasitoid suggested that intercropping maize or sorghum with molasses grass was not likely to enhance the foraging behaviour of D. busseolae. Volatiles from the molasses grass may hinder D. busseolae's host location efficiency.

In general, only monoculture systems have been modeled. Furthermore, there have been few experiments under field conditions at farm scale, where clear evidence for the benefits of intercropping is lacking. This work focus on mechanistic modeling approaches based on the ecological functioning of the microbial biomass, to quantify the daily exchange of C and N between plant organs, micro-organisms, rhizobial symbionts, soil compartments and the atmosphere in an arable intercropping system. The MOMOS model was validated on C and N data collected from a common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv. El Djadida) and maize (Zea mays L. cv. Filou) intercropping system. The experiment was performed at two field sites that were chosen with farmers to represent both high and low soil P availability. The results show that all C and N exchanges were successfully predicted at 5% significance and that they depend on the phenological stage, especially the flowering stage. Increased C allocation from photosynthesis to roots contributed to increasing both grain yield and N grain for intercropped maize. C and N stocks in the common bean nodules were lower in intercropping than in monocultures, and this is associated with the decrease of total atmospheric nitrogen (N-2) fixation by intercropped common beans, in particular with a high soil P. However, the rate of N-2 fixation was higher in the intercrops than in the monoculture when the soil is P-deficient. Micro-organisms were responsible for most of the C losses from the soil to the atmosphere but intercropping significantly reduced the C losses by improving micro-organism C use efficiency. These results uncover the strong link between N and C stocks, confirming the robustness of the newly formulated MOMOS equations that are validated in this paper. This agroecological modeling experiment demonstrated the functional role of microbial biomass, in both the growth of the intercrops crop and their symbiosis, improving the prediction of the daily C and N flows between plant organs, soil compartments and the atmosphere.

Two experiments were conducted to evaluate biological yield, essential oil (EO) composition and yield of sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) treated with N-2 fixing bacteria in additive intercropping with forage maize during the 2018 and 2019. Treatments were arranged in factorial split-plot-in time in randomized complete block design with three replications. The factors were 100% chemical fertilizer (N), N-2 fixing bacteria (Azospirillum brasilense and Azotobacter chroococcum), integration of N-2 fixing bacteria + 50% nitrogen chemical fertilizer and control. The cropping pattern factor included of sole cropping basil and the additive intercropping of maize + 25% basil, maize + 50% basil, maize + 75% basil, and maize + 100% basil. The results indicated that the highest essential oil yield (30.8 kg ha(-1)) and essential oil percentage (0.75%) were obtained in sole cropping with A. brasilense and A. chroococcum + 50% chemical nitrogen fertilizer application in second harvest in 2019. In both cropping systems, the N-2 fixing bacteria application significantly increased fresh and dry yield and land equivalent ratio (LER) as compared to control plants. In both years of experiments could remarkably vary depending on type of treatment. In both years, eight constituents including methyl chavicol (17.24-51.28%), Z-citral (neral) (8.33-24.3%), geranial (10.2-31.3%), (E)-caryophyllene (1.05-5.64%), alpha-trans-bergamotene (0.53-1.7%), alpha-humulene (0.4-1.69%), germacrene-D (0.2-1.88%), and (Z)-alpha- bisabolene (1.16-3.86%) were the main constituents of EO. The highest content of methyl chavicol was found through sole cropping of sweet basil with nitrogen chemical fertilizer followed by sole cropping of sweet basil with an integration of A. brasilense and A. chroococcum + 50% nitrogen chemical fertilizer in 2018 and 2019. Intercropping system and N-2 fixing bacteria can be effective in reducing chemical fertilizer consumption and environmental pollution and achieving the sustainable agriculture goals.

Intercropping systems are designed by growing two, or more, annual crop species in the same field, aiming for a better resource use efficiency. However, assembly rules for their design are lacking. Notably, it is unknown whether species performances are maximized during both the vegetative and reproductive phases given the sensitivity of reproductive allocation rules to resource limitation. Interestingly, ecological theory provides expectations regarding putative invariance of plant reproductive allometry (PRA) under non-limiting conditions for plant growth. Here we examined whether and how PRA changes in response to plant-plant interactions in intercropping systems, which can inform both ecological theory and the understanding of the functioning of intercropping systems. We analysed a dataset of 28 field cereal-legume intercropping trials from various climatic and management conditions across Western Europe. PRA was quantified in both mixing and single-species situations. Plant reproductive allometry was positively impacted in specific management conditions, leading to a greater increase in yield for a given increase in plant size. Variations in PRA were more beneficial to legumes grown in unfertilized mixtures, which explains their use as a key component in actual intercropping systems. The response for cereals was similar but less pronounced in magnitude, and was greater under resource-limiting conditions. Focusing on intercropping conditions, hierarchical competition (indicated by biomass difference between intercropped species) appears as a strong driver of the reproductive output of a given species. Synthesis and applications. Plant reproductive allometry (PRA) behaves in crop species in the same way as it does in wild species. However, contrary to theoretical expectations about an overall invariance of PRA, we highlighted taxon-specific and context-dependent effects of plant-plant interactions on PRA. This systematic deviation to PRA expectations could be leveraged to cultivate each species up to its reproductive optimum while accounting for the performance of the other, whether farmer's objective is to favour one species or to reach an equilibrium in seed production. Sowing density and cultivar choice could regulate the biomass of each component, with specific targets derived from allometric relationships, aiming for an optimal reproductive allocation in mixtures.

Two study sites in western Kenya were sampled. There were two treatments at each site, maize monocrop and 'push-pull'. The latter comprised an intercrop of maize and Desmodium, Desmodium uncinatum Jaccl., with Napier grass, Pennisetum purpureum (Schumach), as a trap crop planted around the edge of the plot (spaced I m from main crop). Trichogramma spp. were recovered from stemborer eggs while Cotesia sesamiae and Cotesia flavipes were recovered from stemborer larvae, and Dentichasmias busseolae from pupae. Mean number of eggs parasitized was significantly higher in the maize monocrop than in the 'push-pull' plots however proportions parasitized did not differ between the two systems. The number of larvae and pupae parasitized and dead from causes other than parasitism similarly did not differ between cropping systems. Proportions of larvae and pupae parasitized were significantly higher in the 'push-pull' than in the monocrop plots, indicating that the activity of larval and pupal parasitoids was enhanced. C sesamiae female wasps were attracted to the volatiles from Desmodium flowers but not those from the leaves in a four-arm olfactometer bioassay. A total of 1530 individual Collembola in seven families were recovered from the plots. The 'push-pull' strategy did not have any significant effect on Collembola abundance and dominance. The factors underlying these observations and their implications are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	"[Midega, Charles A.

J	"Singh, A; Singh, T"				"Singh, Angrej; Singh, Thakar"			Growth, yield and quality of Bt cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) as influenced by different intercropping systems and nitrogen levels	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article								A field experiment was conducted during the rainy (kharif) season of 2010 and 2011 at Ludhiana, Punjab to study the effect of intercrops and different levels of recommended dose of nitrogen (RDN). Applied to intercrops on growth, yield and quality of hybrid Bt cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). The main plot treatments comprised Bt cotton intercropped with fodder maize (Zea mays L., Saccharata), fodder cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.], summer mungbean [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek], pearlmillet fodder [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br. emend. Stuntz] and long melon [Cucumis melo L. var. utilissiumus Duth. & Full.] and subplot treatments consisted of 5 levels (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100%) of recommended dose of nitrogen applied to intercrops on area basis. The maximum seed-cotton equivalent yield recorded under Bt cotton + fodder maize intercropping system (2.61 t/ha) was 10.6, 17.6, 27.3 and 39.6% higher than Bt cotton + fodder cowpea, Bt cotton + summer mungbean, Bt cotton + long melon and Bt cotton + fodder pearlmillet, respectively. The maximum net returns of 249,085 and benefit: cost ratio 2.33 obtained from Bt cotton + fodder maize intercropping system were statistically at par that obtained with Bt cotton + 5 fodder cowpea ((sic)41,545 and benefit: cost ratio 2.12) but significantly higher than all the other intercropping systems. The application of 50% recommended dose of nitrogen to intercrops resulted in 7.0 and 12.4% increase in  seed-cotton and seed-cotton equivalent yield as compared to no fertilizer application to intercrops. In all the inter cropping systems except Bt cotton + long melon, application of full dose of nitrogen to Bt cotton and 50% of the RDN to intercrops proved beneficial for getting higher seed-cotton equivalent yield and economic returns.

Benth. (witchweed) through an allelopathic mechanism. Isoschaftoside, a di-C-glycosylflavone, isolated from the root extract and root exudate of Desmodium, interferes with in vitro radicle development of germinated Striga. The biosynthetic pathway of this class of compound is already mostly present in edible legumes and in cereals, so characterisation of the enzyme and genes that control C-glycosylflavone biosynthesis has the potential to create this protection mechanism in other agriculturally important plants.

Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) relay intercropping rotation systems are a mainstay of the measures to improve the economic and food security situation in China. Therefore, a 2-year field study (2015-2017) was conducted to evaluate the effect of different N fertilizer management regimes on the photosynthetic characteristics and uptake and translocation of N in peanut in the wheat-peanut rotation system. We used common compound fertilizer (CCF) and controlled-release compound fertilizer (CRF) at the same N-P2O5-K2O proportion (The contents of N, P2O5, and K2O in the two kinds of fertilizer were 20, 15, and 10%, respectively.). The fertilizer was applied on the day before sowing, at the jointing stage or the flag leaf stage of winter wheat, and at the initial flowering stage of peanut in various proportions, with 0 kg N ha 1 as the control. Results showed that split applications of N significantly increased leaf area index (LAI) and chlorophyll content and improved photosynthetic rate, thus increasing the pod yield of peanut. Topdressing N at the jointing stage (S1) or at the flag leaf stage of wheat (S2) and supplying part of the N at the initial flowering stage of peanut increased pod yield. Withholding N until the flag leaf stage (S2) did not negatively affect wheat grain yield; however, it increased N accumulation in each organ and N allocation proportions in the peanut pod, ultimately improving pod yield. With the same N-P2O5-K2O proportion and equivalent amounts of nutrient, CRF can decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) and maintain a relatively high LAI and chlorophyll content at the late growth stage of peanut, prolong the functional period of peanut leaves and delay leaf senescence, resulting in an increase of pod yield over that with CCF. At S1, CRF resulted in a better pod yield than CCF by 9.4%, and at S2 it was 12.6% higher. In summary, applying N fertilizer in three splits and delaying the topdressing fertilization until the flag leaf stage of winter wheat increases total grain yields of wheat and peanut. This method could therefore be an appropriate N management strategy for wheat-peanut relay intercropping rotation systems in China."

This study was focused to find ways to ameliorate the soil fertility degraded by past soil erosion. Different cropping patterns viz maize-wheat-maize rotation (C1), maize-lentil-maize rotation (C2) and maize-wheat+lentil intercrop-maize rotation (C3) and different soil treatments, namely, the control (T1), 50 NP (also called the farmer's practice) (T2), 100 % NPK or the recommended dose of NPK (T3) and 20 t ha(-1) farmyard manure integrated with 50 % N and 100 % PK (T4) were tested in a randomized complete block (RCB) design with split plot arrangements. Integrated use of organic manure (farmyard manure) and inorganic NPK fertilizers (T4) produced the highest wheat grain yield (4730 kg ha(-1)), which was 9 % higher than the 100 % inorganic NPK (T3, 4349 kg ha(-1)) and more than twice the control (T1, 2072 kg ha(-1)). The increase in lentil grain yield in T4 (1112 kg ha(-1)) was 7.4 % higher than in the recommended NPK levels for lentils (T3, 1035 kg ha(-1)) and 79% higher than the control. A significant nutrient enrichment and an improvement in soil fertility parameters was recorded by T4 over T3. This was further augmented by the application of cereal-legume rotation (C2) in the traditional cereal-cereal rotation (Cl) and their combination showed a significantly improved residual effect on soil fertility in the subsequent year. In conclusion the degraded soil fertility of Missa gullied soil cannot be ameliorated to its full potential with only the recommended dose of mineral fertilizers. 50 % N from organic fertilizer sources and the inclusion of legumes in the crop rotation is necessary to ensure agricultural sustainability on such soils.

The experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design (RCBD) with factorial arrangement comprising three replications. Pearl millet was sown alone and in association with cluster bean and cowpea with three sowing techniques like line sowing at 30cm apart rows, 45cm apart rows and by broadcast method. The net plot size was 8 m x 2.7 m. Data on growth, yield and quality parameters was recorded using standard procedures and was statistically analyzed by using Fisher's analysis of variance technique. Yield and quality parameters of pearl millet gave significantly better results by mix cropping with cluster bean. Results showed that maximum green forage yield (73.33 t ha(-1)), dry matter yield (15.25 t0 ha(-1)) and crude protein % age (17.98 %) was recorded by pearl millet and cluster bean sown in association with each other in 30 cm apart rows. Maximum benefit cost ratio (2.81) was calculated where pearl millet + cluster bean were sown at 30 cm apart rows. So it is recommended that pearl millet should be sown together with cluster bean in 30 cm apart rows to obtain maximum forage yield and protein% age under agro ecological conditions of Faisalabad.

In order to study the competition effects of wheat against rye, an experiment was conducted at the research centers of Karaj and Varamin, Iran, during 2001 and 2002. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with 24 treatments and four replications. The treatments included pure stands of wheat at densities of 350, 450, 550, and 650 plants m(-2) and volunteer rye densities of 10, 30, 50, and 70 plants m(-2), and mixed stands of wheat and rye at complete factorial densities. The results indicated that rye was a superior competitor compared to wheat. The biological and economic yields of wheat were mainly affected by interspecific competition in the Karaj region. This was also true during the first year in the Varamin region but, in the second year, the biological and economic yields of wheat were equally affected by interspecific and intraspecific competition because of increasing precipitation. The evaluation of competitive ability, using regression coefficients, showed that in Karaj, the effect of one rye plant on wheat was approximately equivalent to three and two plants of wheat in reducing the grain yield of wheat in the first and second years, respectively, while in Varamin, it was equivalent to three and 1.2 plants of wheat, respectively. In other words, each 0.36 and 0.51 rye plant in Karaj and each 0.36 and 0.84 rye plant in Varamin had the same impact on the reciprocal wheat grain yield as did one wheat plant in the first and second years, respectively.

Effect of cotton-cowpea intercropping on C and N mineralisation patterns of residue mixtures and soil	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH			English	Article						"cotton-cowpea intercropping; carbon and nitrogen mineralisation; crop residue mixtures"	"NITROGEN MINERALIZATION; CROP RESIDUES; CARBON; MAIZE; DECOMPOSITION; FERTILIZER; DYNAMICS; RECOVERY; NITRATE; YIELD"	"Carbon and nitrogen mineralisation potential of mixed cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp) crop residues produced under intercropping, as well as a reddish-brown soil classified by FAO as Ferralic Cambisol previously under intercrops, were studied over a 10-week incubation period under controlled conditions (25 degrees C and moisture content of 70% field capacity, 125 mm) in the laboratory. Treatments consisted of cotton residues ( 100 : 0), cowpea residues ( 0 : 100), and cotton-cowpea residues ( 50 : 50, 70 : 30, and 30 : 70). These ratios were based on yields obtained in different cotton-cowpea intercrop treatments from a field study. Cowpea residues ( 0 : 100) released the highest amount of mineral N of 36.4 mg/kg soil, and cotton residues ( 100 : 0) least, 19.2 mg/kg soil, while the other mixtures were in between. All treatments except for cowpea residues ( 0 : 100) and the 30 : 70 mixture showed immobilisation of soil N during the first 2 weeks of incubation. The trend for C mineralisation was similar to that of N, and cowpea residues ( 0 : 100) released the highest amount, 492 mg C/kg soil, while cotton residues ( 100 : 0) recorded the least, 315 mg C/kg soil. The C mineralisation patterns of cowpea residues ( 0 : 100) and 30 : 70 treatments were exponential and were well described by the equation: C = C-E(1 - e(-kt)) where C-E is exponentially mineralisable C fraction, k is the rate constant, and t is time in days. The mineralisation patterns for other treatments were sigmoidal and were well described by the equation: C = C-S/1+e(-(t t0/k)) where CS is sigmoidally mineralisable C fraction; t(0) is time in days required for complete mineralisation of CS, while k is rate constant. The amount of N released from soil previously under cotton-cowpea intercrops and sole crops was approximately one-third of the amount released when the residues were incorporated. The highest amount of N released (12.2 mg/kg soil) was from soil previously under sole cowpea, while soil from the 1 : 1 cotton-cowpea intercrop released 9.9 mg/kg soil and soil from sole cotton released 5.9 mg/kg soil. There was no significant effect ( P > 0.05) of previous crop on C mineralisation patterns of the soil. Mixtures slow down N losses and increase nutrient use efficiency of legume residues, especially in the short-term. When cotton is grown as a sole crop, starter N to offset negative effects of initial N-immobilisation at the start of season is required. A better understanding of controlling parameters of decomposition can make it possible to predict C and N mineralisation patterns in mixtures. Reduced C mineralisation in cotton-cowpea mixtures may result in more C sequestration and, hence, SOM build-up and improved sustainability in the long term in intercropping systems."

The main bio-agronomic traits, dry matter forage yield (DMY) and quantity of crude protein (CP) were determined in both sole crop and intercrop. The land equivalent ratio (LER) was used for evaluating biological efficiency and competitive ability of the intercrops. Our results showed that the total calculated LER for fodder and protein yields was always greater than one and corresponded to crop yield advantages of 16.0% and 11.5%, respectively. Our data also highlighted the low competitive ability of the ryegrass in intercrop, which achieved the lowest yield among all the mixtures. Conversely, the same grass showed the best green fodder quality, due to the high incidence of the legume, equal (on average) to 46%. Triticale and barley, harvested for silage (hard dough stage), provided the best quantitative and qualitative results both in sole crop and intercropped with common vetch and pea, determined mainly by the cereal grain.

We have, during field conditions in central Sweden, evaluated the contribution of intercropped peas (Pisum sativum L.) and oats (Avena sativa L.) to the overall N economy. We have done this by determining the N-2 fixation by the difference method and by the N-15-dilution method using two reference crops. N-2 fixing efficiency was calculated as fixed nitrogen of total pea nitrogen and of dry matter, respectively. We complemented this by determining the mineral nitrogen at three soil levels before and after the growing seasons. Our results indicate that nitrogen yield sometimes, but not dry matter yield, was affected by pea ratio. The efficiency of the fixation increased with decreasing pea ratio. This could be explained by competition for N from the intercropped oats, in which the N-concentration decreased with decreasing pea ratio. Results indicate that peas supplied the intercropped oats with nitrogen. Residual soil mineral nitrogen after harvest was similar in the intercrop to the pure stand of oats, while it was higher in a pure stand of peas. This was repeated in one out of three trials following the winter season. The nitrate to total mineral N ratio was higher in the pure stand of peas and lower in the intercrop and the pure oats. The studied crops did not give different residual effects in nitrogen and dry matter contents in a following oat crop. Conclusions are that intercropping may increase the efficiency of fixation and reduce risk of N leaching, but this is not necessarily reflected in current yields or subsequent crops.

The N-15 enrichment and natural abundance techniques were used to determine N accumulation in the crops from the soil, fertilizer and symbiotic N-2 fixation. Intercrops of pea and wheat showed maximum productivity without the supply of N fertilizer. Intercropping increased total dry matter (DM) and N yield, grain DM and N yield, grain N concentration, the proportion of N derived from symbiotic N-2 fixation, and soil N accumulation. With increasing fertilizer N supply, intercropped and sole cropped wheat responded with increased yield, grain N yield and soil N accumulation, whereas the opposite was the case for pea. Fertilizer N enhanced the competitive ability of intercropped wheat recovering up to 90% of the total intercrop fertilizer N acquisition and decreased the proportion of pea in the intercrop, but without influencing the total intercrop grain yield. As a consequence, Land Equivalent Ratios calculated on basis of total DM production decreased from a maximum of 1.34 to as low as 0.85 with increased fertilizer N supply. The study suggests that pea-wheat intercropping is a cropping strategy that use N sources efficiently due to its spatial self-regulating dynamics where pea improve its interspecific competitive ability in areas with lower soil N levels, and vice versa for wheat, paving way for future option to reduce N inputs and negative environmental impacts of agricultural crop production.

The new model was tested on intercrops of pea (Pisum sativum L.) and spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). A 3-year dataset on pea and barley sole crop growth was used for calibration. Two datasets that included detailed measurements of crop production, nitrogen uptake and leaf area indices from two sites were used for testing. An arable organic experiment from three sites including several treatments over 4 years was also used for testing. The model predicted the increase in resource utilisation of pea and barley and effects on pea symbiotic nitrogen fixation satisfactorily. The effects of pea interspecific competition on barley production agreed with observations, but the simulated effect of barley interspecific competition on pea was underestimated. Sensitivity analyses showed that the vertical distribution of barley leaf area had a great influence on the Outcome of the interspecific competition between the barley and pea crops.

Leaf senescence (LS) occurs at the later stage of plant development but can also be initiated by high temperature (HT) stress. LS involves the breakdown of certain key developmental processes in plants, which affect leaf greenness, thereby decreasing plant photosynthetic performance. Light signaling pathway modulates plant growth processes under high-temperature stress, suggesting that light and temperature signaling pathways are linked. However, our knowledge of how light signaling pathways delay LS in soybean under HT remains incomplete. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate how low light signaling pathway delays LS in soybean under HT stress. The results showed that low light signaling delayed LS in soybean under high-temperature stress. Our gas exchange analysis showed that low light signaling improved soybean photosynthetic process and chlorophyll contents under HT stress. Further analysis indicated that low light treatment improved soybean soluble sugar, starch, and free amino acids of plants exposed to HT stress. The phytohormones analysis suggested that under low light, plants accumulated endogenous jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) when exposed to HT stress. The transcriptional analysis suggested that soybean STAY-GREEN genes (GmSGR1and GmSGR2), sucrose phosphate synthase genes (GmSPS1 and GmSPS2), and starch synthase genes (GmAGP1 and GmUGP1-1) were upregulated in the high-temperature and low light treatment. Again, the JA defense pathway genes GmPDF1.2, GmJAR1.1 GmFAD3.1, and GmPR4.2 expression levels were significantly upregulated in the high-temperature and low light treatment as compared to SA defense pathway genes GmSID2, GmEDS5, GmNPR1, and GmPR1. The regulation mechanisms involving how low light signaling delays leaf senescence in soybean under high temperature through improved photosynthetic rate and JA defense signaling activation are discussed.

The main plots were sowing method in two levels (row and mixed sowing) and subplots were five intercropping ratios of wheat and chickpea (75:25, 25:75, 50:50, 100:0 and 0:100) and nitroxin biofertilizer seed inoculation at two levels (inoculation and no inoculation). The 2-year analysis showed that some yield components and yield of wheat and chickpea significantly increased under the influence of sowing pattern, sowing ratios and inoculation with nitroxin. The row sowing pattern increased the wheat and chickpea yield by 13.68% and 4.12%, respectively. Also, the total seed yield increased with all intercropping ratios and reached a maximum (1269.83 kg ha(-1)) at the 50:50 ratio. Nitroxin increased the yield of wheat and chickpea seeds by 7.12% and 12.6%, respectively. Furthermore, the maximum land equivalent ratio, competitive ratio, and actual yield loss were obtained using the row sowing pattern and nitroxin. Finally, the maximum land equivalent ratio (1.53) and actual yield loss (1.13) were achieved in the 50:50 sowing ratio and the maximum competitive ratio (2.18) was obtained in the 25:75 ratio.

The objectives of this study were (i) to assess long-term (17 years) contributions of cover crop- or forage-based no-till rotations and their related shoot and root additions to the accumulation of C in bulk and in physical fractions of a subtropical Ferralsol (20-cm depth); and (ii) infer if these rotations promote C sequestration and reach an eventual C saturation level in the soil. A wheat (Triticum aestivum L., winter crop)-soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr, summer crop) succession was the baseline system. The soil under alfalfa (Medicago sativa L, hay forage) intercropped every three years with maize (Zea mays L., summer crop) had the highest C accumulation (0.44 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)). The bi-annual rotation of ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam., hay winter forage)-maize-ryegrass-soybean had a soil C sequestration of 0.32 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). Among the two bi-annual cover crop-based rotations, the vetch (Vicia villosa Roth, winter cover crop)-maize-wheat-soybean rotation added 7.58 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) as shoot plus root and sequestered 0.28 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). The counterpart grass-based rotation of oat (Avena strigosa Schreb., winter cover crop)-maize-wheat-soybean sequestered only 0.16 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1), although adding 13% more C (8.56 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)). The vetch legume-based rotation, with a relative conversion factor (RCF) of 0.147, was more efficient in converting biomass C into sequestered soil C than oat grass-based rotation (RCF = 0.057). Soil C stocks showed a close relationship (R-2 = 0.72-0.98, P < 0.10) with root C addition, a poor relationship with total C addition and no relationship with shoot C addition. This suggests a more effective role of root than shoot additions in C accumulation in this no-till soil. Most of the C accumulation took place in the mineral-associated organic matter (71-95%, in the 0-5 cm layer) compared to the particulate organic matter. The asymptotic relationship between root C addition and C stocks in bulk soil and in mineral-associated fraction supports the idea of C saturation. In conclusion, forages or legume cover crops contribute to C sequestration in no-till tropical Ferrasols, and most of this contribution is from roots and stored in the mineral-associated fraction. This combination of soil and rotations can reach an eventual soil C saturation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Treatment, consisted of A) Leucaena intercropped with 3 vigna and 3 guinea grass furrows sown after the vigna harvest, B) Leucaena intercropped with 2 maize and I guinea grass furrows. C) Leucaena intercropped with 2 vigna and I guinea grass furrows, D) Leueaena intercropped with I guinea grass furrow (control). The highest production (P < 0.05) of vigna grains (0.75 t/ha) was obtained when furrows were sown within a double row of leucaena in May and the 3 furrows of guinea grass were sown later in July. This treatment showed the highest yield of crop residues (4.4 t/ha DM), differing (P < 0.001) from that of vigna (2.25 t/ha). Maize yield was affected by rodent attacks. The number of plants/m(2) (4.0-5.3). height (99-127 cm), stems/plant (9.6-10.1) and yield (0.14-0.19 t/ha DM) of leucaena was similar in all tntatments. The smallest plants (58 cm) and highest CP content (12.21 %) of guinea grass ev likoni was obtained when planting in July, after the vigna harvest. Three vigna furrows sown in May and 3 guinea grass furrows in July was the treatment that contributed with more biomass to the system (7.69 t/ha DM) and 0.79 t/ha of CP. Furthermore, this treatment offered good net returns (2750.55 Cuban pesos). It is concluded that intercropping these crops did not affect the establishment of leucaena and guinea gram cv likoni. and that the best economic, production and total biomass quality alternative was treatment A: Leucaena intercropped with 3 vigna furrows in May and 3 guinea grass furrows sown after the vigna harvest in July.

However, the mechanism of such systemic signaling has not been revealed yet. Our studies on different species suggest the involvement of carbohydrates in light-dependent systemic regulation between different parts of a plant under both short- and long-term light heterogeneity. Leaves exposed to better light condition perform enhanced photosynthetic capacity, and act to compensate for the decline in photosynthesis of other leaves under bad light condition within the same plant. This kind of compensatory photosynthesis has a close relationship to the distribution of carbohydrates, and can be regarded as an integrative strategy to make efficient use of sunlight at the whole-plant level.

Walp.] were investigated on a soil under continuous cropping. Fertilizer application significantly increased nodule counts at 10 weeks after planting in cowpea sole and in cowpea-okra (Hibiscus esculentus L.)-tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. nom, cons.) and in cowpea-maize (Zea mays L.)-okra-tomato intercropping systems. Cowpea in cowpea-okra-tomato intercropping had the highest nodule weight at 10 weeks. The lowest weight was obtained from sole cowpea without fertilizer. Fertilizer significantly increased root weight in sole and intercropped cowpea. Soils carrying sole okra and tomato, including their combinations with 1,2 or 3 crops possessed reduced microbial populations due to fertilizer application, except cowpea-maize-tomato and maize-tomato. Fertilized and unfertilized tomato soils contained the highest microbial population, while soils carrying 4 crop combinations had the lowest. Simple correlation analysis indicated that cowpea yield, root weight, nodule count and nodule weight were highly and positively correlated and the correlation was highest at 10 weeks after planting. Nodule counts and weight were highly significantly correlated at each sampling stage. Fertilizer application increased greater nodulation in the intercrops but resulted in a lower seed yield of cowpea.

Our objective was to do a meta-analysis on cereal-legume intercrops testing the effects of N fertilization on land equivalent ration (LER; partial and total LER), yield ratio, and proportion of legume in the mixture of crop grains. This analysis was based on 17 published studies reporting the results of experiments performed in 15 countries on six species of cereals and 10 species of legumes. Experiments were generally based on replacement (50-50, i.e., in the intercrop, each species is sown at half the sowing rate used for the sole crop) or full substitutive (100-100, i.e., the sowing rate for each crop in the intercrop is identical to that for sole crops) designs. Nitrogen fertilization rates ranged from 0 to 180 kg N ha(-1). The effect of N fertilization and its inter-study variability were analyzed with mixed-effect statistical models, including study as a random effect. Results showed that N fertilization had non-significant effects on average LER and average yield ratio but that the inter-study variability of these effects was large. Nitrogen fertilization was found to significantly decrease the grain proportion of the legume in the mixture and the partial LER of the legume in studies based on C-3 cereal intercrops.

The experiment was installed in 2006 at the district of Itahum, city of Dourados, state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, made possible through a partnership between Embrapa Western Agriculture and Paraiso Farm. Treatments consisted of (1) Jatropha in monocrop, with no plant at the interrrows; or the following plants cultivaded at the interrows of Jatropha: (2) Stylosanthes spp.; (3) Brachiaria ruziziensis; (4) Brachiaria ruziziensis + Stylosanthess pp.; (5) Brachiaria humidicola; (6) Panicum maximum cv. massai; (7) Cajanus cajan cv. anao; (8) Crotalaria spectabilis; (9) Crop rotation system 1 - (maize second crop - Crambe abyssinica - soybean - peanut); and (10) Crop rotation system 2 - (cowpea - radish - maize - cowpea) conducted for two years. Phytosociological characterization of weed species was accomplished in 2011 based on the Ecological Approach. Estimations of relative abundance, frequency, dominance and Importance Value Index were obtained. Areas were also characterized by the diversity coefficients of Simpson and modified Shannon-Weiner, and then grouped by cluster analysis. Areas with low soil coverage resulted in higher infestation levels; crop rotation in the interrows of Jatropha produced a significant reduction in weed infestation, but the lowest infestation levels were observed when grasses were grown intercropped with Jatropha. Lower diversity coefficients were associated with occurrence of the most troublesome weed species. In the first years after planting Jatropha, species of Brachiaria or a crop rotation involving species with high mulching ability and whose biomass exhibit a high C:N ratio, should be established in the interrows to avoid problems with weeds infestation."

How does pea architecture influence light sharing in virtual wheat-pea mixtures? A simulation study based on pea genotypes with contrasting architectures	AOB PLANTS			English	Article							"PLANT ARCHITECTURE; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; INTERCEPTION EFFICIENCY; THEORETICAL-ANALYSIS; N-2 FIXATION; MODEL; DENSITY; CULTIVARS; EXPANSION; GROWTH"	Background and aims Light interception is a key factor driving the functioning of wheat-pea intercrops. The sharing of light is related to the canopy structure, which results from the architectural parameters of the mixed species. In the present study, we characterized six contrasting pea genotypes and identified architectural parameters whose range of variability leads to various levels of light sharing within virtual wheat-pea mixtures. Methodology Virtual plants were derived from magnetic digitizations performed during the growing cycle in a greenhouse experiment. Plant mock-ups were used as inputs of a radiative transfer model in order to estimate light interception in virtual wheat-pea mixtures. The turbid medium approach, extended to well-mixed canopies, was used as a framework for assessing the effects of leaf area index (LAI) and mean leaf inclination on light sharing. Principal results Three groups of pea genotypes were distinguished: (i) early and leafy cultivars, (ii) late semi-leafless cultivars and (iii) low-development semi-leafless cultivars. Within open canopies, light sharing was well described by the turbid medium approach and was therefore determined by the architectural parameters that composed LAI and foliage inclination. When canopy closure started, the turbid medium approach was unable to properly infer light partitioning because of the vertical structure of the canopy. This was related to the architectural parameters that determine the height of pea genotypes. Light capture was therefore affected by the development of leaflets, number of branches and phytomers, as well as internode length. Conclusions This study provides information on pea architecture and identifies parameters whose variability can be used to drive light sharing within wheat-pea mixtures. These results could be used to build up the architecture of pea ideotypes adapted to multi-specific stands towards light competition.

The plots consisted of seven lines of 7.5 m length with 0.45 m spacing between the lines. The evaluated parameters were: thy matter of the plant cover, dry matter of the aerial part (beans), production components, weight of 100 grains, and grain yield. The intercropping of maize and cover crops promoted an increase in dry matter over the soil, compared to the exclusive maize crop. There was an increase in the dry matter of bean plants with the increase in N rates in the two years of cultivation; regarding productivity, there was an increment only in the first year of cultivation. The maize consortium with cover plants provided adequate soil cover, but did not influence the productivity of beans cultivated in succession in the two years of cultivation."

This review synthesizes the research findings on how intercropping affects productivity, quality, competitiveness and economic viability of sorghum-legumes mixed, row and strip intercropping systems under varied pedo-climatic conditions. Though component crops show yield reductions in row (additive and row-replacement series), mixed (seed blended crops) and strip intercropping systems, in general overall productivity per unit land area increases to a great extent. The significantly higher resource capturing with better utilization efficacy by intercrops in temporal and spatial dimensions helps explain their greater productivity. In addition, forage intercrops result in improved nutritional quality as legumes contain protein in double quantity than cereals. Cereal-legumes intercropping systems yield higher quantities of lush green forage with improved quality traits, which ultimately increase monetary benefits. Furthermore, legumes inclusion as an intercrop with cereals has the potential to serve as a nitrogen-saving strategy due to the biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) process. Moreover, cereal-legume intercropping systems are effective in reducing weed infestationsand soil erosion by providing extended soil cover, as well as in increasing water use efficiency and improving soil fertility. However, despite a significant increase in overall productivity, component crops suffer yield losses in intercropping systems owing to competition for the finite divisible pool of growth resources. Thus, there is a dire need to optimize spatial and temporal arrangements in sorghum-legumes intercropping systems to achieve maximum productivity and economic returns.

However, whether neighboring plants influence the microbial colonization of the host's root and further affect host performance is less understood. In this study, using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing of peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) roots from over 5 years of mono- and intercropping field systems, we found that neighbor maize can alter the peanut root microbial composition and re-shape microbial community assembly. Interspecific maize coexistence increased the colonization of genera Bradyrhizobium and Streptomyces in intercropped peanut roots. Through endophytic bacterial isolation and isolate back inoculation experiments, we demonstrated that the functional potentials of available nutrient accumulation and phytohormones production from Bradyrhizobium and Streptomyces endowed them with the ability to act as keystones in the microbial network to benefit peanut growth and production with neighbor competition. Our results support the idea that plants establish a plant-endophytic microbial holobiont through root selective filtration to enhance host competitive dominance, and provide a promising direction to develop modern diversified planting for harnessing crop microbiomes for the promotion of crop growth and productivity in sustainable agriculture.

Effects of type and amount of crop residue in rainfed rice based cropping systems in Madagascar	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Weed emergence; Weed biomass; Rainfed rice; No till; Conservation agriculture; Smallholder farms"	"CAPSICUM-ANNUUM L.; CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; COVER CROP; TILLAGE SYSTEMS; MAIZE; EMERGENCE; BIOMASS; YIELD; PRINCIPLES; STRATEGIES"	Weeds are a major constraint to crop yields in tropical production systems, especially for smallholder farmers who cannot afford to purchase herbicides. It has been argued that the practice of mulching with crop residues can suppress weeds in conservation agriculture systems. However, few data are available on the effect of crop residue mulching on weed infestation. In this study we quantified the effect of increasing amounts of surface crop residues on weed emergence, weed biomass production and rice yield. The experiment was conducted during four growing seasons in the Lake Alaotra region, Madagascar. Two types of mulch were applied on a no-tilled soil, Stylosanthes guianensis and a mixture of maize and Dolichos lablab, with different amounts ranging from 0 to 45 Mg dry matter ha(-1). Weed emergence was measured every week from the day of the first rain that triggered weed germination to 100 days thereafter, and weed biomass was monitored at four dates during the cropping season. Our results show that weed emergence and weed biomass decreased with increasing amount of residue. More than 10 Mg ha(-1) was, however, needed to significantly reduce weed emergence and weed biomass as compared to the bare soil treatment without surface residues. Rice grain yields decreased by 16% for an increase in weed biomass of one Mg ha(-1). Our results indicate that mulching is not a viable option of weed control for smallholder farmers, given the low amounts of residue currently retained on their fields, which is at best about 4 Mg ha(-1) in the case of a stylosanthes crop and about 5 Mg ha(-1) in case of dolichos intercropped with maize.

Berseem clover was intercropped with barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), oat (A vena sativa L.), or triticale (x Triticosecale rimpaui Wittm.) at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 240 cereal plants m(-2) at Edmonton, Alberta, from 1998 to 2001. Cereals dominated Cut 1 (silage-stage) yield, and berseem clover dominated regrowth yield. As cereal density decreased from 240 to 60 plants m(-2), Cut 1 yield decreased from 10.5 to 9.3 Mg ha(-1) dry matter (DM), berseem clover percentage of Cut 1 increased from 5 to 14%, and berseem clover regrowth yield (Cut 2) increased from 1.8 to 3.0 Mg ha(-1) DM. Total season intercrop yields with barley or oat at 60 plants m(-2) were yields with 240 plants m(-1). Total season intercrop DM yields did not differ among the three cereal species in 3 of 4 yr. Triticale intercrops had advantages of greater Cut 1 yield and greater berseem clover percentage in Cut 1. Barley intercrops had advantages of greater Cut 2 yield and greater total season protein yield. Greater Cut 2 yield with barley intercrops was related to earlier silage-stage (Cut 1) harvest date. Intercropping berseem clover with reduced seeding rates of cereals improved Cut 1 forage quality. When berseem clover was 20% of Cut 1 yield, neutral detergent fiber was 25 to 45 g kg(-1) less than with cereals alone. The crude protein of berseem clover regrowth averaged 210 g kg(-1), providing high quality late-season forage.

Mixing corn silage and legumes can enhance silage quality and hence animal productivity. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate yield and quality of silages from intercropping between genetically modified corn and soybean for glyphosate tolerance (RR - Roundup Ready) as a function of plant spatial arrangement, soybean variety, and sowing fertilization methods. Two intercropping arrangements of RR corn and RR soybeans were tested: alternate single rows of corn and soybeans and double corn rows for each soybean row. Treatments were randomized blocks with four replications, arranged in a 2x2+1 factorial scheme. The first factor was sowing fertilization method (2): only in corn rows or in total area. The second factor was soybean variety (2): medium- and late-cycle genotypes, and an additional treatment of corn monoculture. After harvest, forage material was analyzed for agronomic characteristics and then ensiled for 60 days. Thereafter, bromatological composition, fermentation profile, and losses were analyzed during silage fermentation process. No differences were observed among treatments for total silage production. Overall, silage from intercropping treatments showed higher levels of hemicellulose, total digestible nutrients, crude protein, and ether extract, thus improving silage quality. However, lower contents of dry matter, acid detergent fiber, and cellulose were also observed in silage from intercropped treatments. In short, adding soybeans to silage can improve final roughage, reducing costs of protein and energy supplements.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the variation of soil CO2 emission (FCO2) and its relationship with soil attributes under long-term no-tillage systems with different successions of summer and winter crop sequences. Treatments consisted of combinations of three summer and two winter crop sequences. Summer sequences were maize monocrop (MM), soybean monocrop (SS), and soybean-maize intercrop (SM), while winter crops were crotalaria and maize, FCO2 showed no difference among summer sequences (p > 0.05) , For winter crops, however, the soil under crotalaria crop residues presented higher FCO2 values (1.03 +/- 0.027 mu mol m(2) s(-1)) when compared to that under maize crop residues (0.94 +/- 0.027 mu mol m(2) s(-1)). Soil moisture presented the greatest influence on the temporal variation of FCO2, being correlated in the summer sequences MM (r =0 .79 ; p < 0 .0001) and SS ( r = 0 .70 ; p = 0.002) , as well as in the winter crop crotalaria (r = 0 .78 ; p < 0 . 0001) and maize (r = 0.66; p = 0 .005) . In the Oxisol under no-tillage for > 14 years, the spatial variation of FCO2 was explained by the soil physical attributes total porosity, macroporosity, microporosity , and soil temperature. The soil under crotalaria crop residues as a winter crop had an improvement in soil physical attributes, leading to a more aerated environment and hence a higher CO2 production process. How ever, the winter crops crotalaria (38 .65 d= 0,0 8 Mg ha(-1)) and maize (38 .14 +/- 0 .09 Mg ha(-1)) also provided a higher carbon stock on this tropical soil. Maize monocrop (41 .13 +/- 0.11 Mg ha(-1)) as a summer crop under no-tillage system also promoted higher carbon stocks on this tropical soil. A strategy to optimize no-tillage systems in terms of FCO2 reduction and increase in soil carbon stock is related to the adoption of crop cultivation that includes legumes and grasses under intercropping and succession. Therefore, our results suggested that the summer sequences used in this study might contribute to reducing FCO2 and that both winter crops influenced the increased soil carbon stock.

In addition, organic acids in the rhizosphere can mobilize external nutrients, which may help nodulation. However, how much NO3- and NH4+ competition and organic acids in the rhizosphere of intercropped crops contribute to N fixation remains unclear and requires study. Methods Field and greenhouse experiments were conducted to quantify effects of N competition and organic acids on N fixation in a maize/alfalfa intercropping system. Results Intercropping increased nitrogen derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa), nodules number, and leghemoglobin content by 43.66%, 85.53%, 141.05%, respectively, leading to significantly improved total N uptake and yield, compared to monoculture. The improved %Ndfa was not only due to the depletion of NO3-, but also significantly correlated with the decrease of NO3-/NH4+ ratio and the increase of citric acid in rhizosphere of alfalfa, which could mobilize soluble resources for N fixation under no N addition. Overall, 15.4%-21.5% of N fixed by alfalfa was transferred to associated maize, and the improved N fixation enhanced N transfer. Conclusions Our findings provide a mechanism for how root interactions facilitate N fixation, highlighting the importance of NO3-/NH4+ ratio and citric acid in nutrient mobilization for N fixation.

In this study, an amending method to enhance phytoremediation of zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) in sewage river sediment was developed, and its assistant mechanisms were investigated, by comparing the effects of four treatments: plants alone, plants treated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, plants treated with arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM), or plants treated with AM plus indigenous bacteria. The plants were grown in intercropping and crop rotation systems including ryegrass and either maize or alfalfa. The results showed that inter cropping and crop rotation effectively reduced Zn and Cu pollution in sediment, particularly when plants were treated with AM. In AM treatment, the Zn remediation effect was better in the maize/ryegrass system, and Zn concentrations in rhizosphere soil decreased the most by 64.37%. Cu was removed better by alfalfa/ryegrass system, with the highest removal rate of 26.93%. AM treatment assisted phytoremediation mainly by increasing the exchangeable and carbonated fractions of HMs and improving the activity of dehydrogenase, polyphenol oxidase and urease in sediment. AM application promoted the uptake of HMs from belowground to aboveground of plants, however, interspecies competition may occur between AM and indigenous bacteria.

Farmers' perceptions of a 'push-pull' technology for control of cereal stemborers and Striga weed in western Kenya	CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						"farmer perceptions; Striga; stemborers; 'Push-pull' technology; Kenya"	"INTEGRATED PEST-MANAGEMENT; PENNISETUM-PURPUREUM VARIETIES; CHILO-PARTELLUS; TRAP PLANTS; ADOPTION; MAIZE; AFRICA; CONSERVATION; STRATEGIES; UGANDA"	Striga and cereal stemborers are major constraints to cereal production in sub-Saharan Africa causing serious food security concerns. The International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) and partners have developed a novel integrated management system called the 'push-pull' technology (PPT) in mitigation. This involves inter-cropping maize with a stemborer moth-repellent forage legume, silverleaf desmodium (push), and planting an attractive trap crop, Napier grass (pull), around the intercrop. Additionally, chemicals produced from desmodium roots inhibit Striga. We evaluated farmers' perceptions of the pests, PPT attributes and factors influencing the likelihood of its adoption in 15 districts in western Kenya. A random sample of 923 farmers, with 478 having adopted the technology (practicing) and 445 not yet adopted but attending PPT field days (visiting) were interviewed. The practicing farmers cited both Striga and stemborers as major maize production constraints, alongside other constraints, as the main motivations for adoption of PPT. Reduced infestation by the pests, improvement in soil fertility, increase in maize grain yields, improved fodder and milk productivity were cited as main benefits of PPT. Similarly, the field day visiting farmers rated PPT as a more superior technology compared to their own maize production practices. Farmer's age, household headship by female farmers, technology attributes and exposure to a variety of extension methods significantly influenced likelihood of PPT adoption. Effective dissemination pathways are needed to provide farmers with appropriate information for evaluating potential benefits and tradeoffs of such a management-intensive technology. Further research is needed to understand how PPT contributes to farmers' livelihood improvement and how the efficacy of different dissemination pathways in PPT technology transfer influences its adoption.

Glycine max. var. Jupiter; Zea mays; Cynodon nlemfuensis"		"The effect of maize, sunflower and soybean intercropping at leucaena sowing on the establishment of this species, the recovery of star grass and grain yield of the intercropped seasonal cultures was studied. A random block design with 4 replications was used. Treatments were: leucaena sown alone or intercropped with 1 or 3 furrows between a double row with maize, sunflower or soybean after a conventional soil preparation; At 35 days of sowing the number of plants/m(2) of leucaena was similar in all treatments (5-6 plants/m(2)). In the cultures, this measurement varied according to the species, being greater(P < 0.001) in soybean when 3 furrows between double rows of leucaena were sown. Yield (t/ha DM), height, leaves and stems/leucaena plants were not affected by the intercropped species 120 days after sowing. The best grain yield was obtained when 3 furrows of soybean between double rows of leucaena (0.72 t/ha) were intercropped. Sunflower contributed 1.95 t/ha of DM of harvest residues which differed (P < 0.05) from the remaining treatments. At the end of the experiment, 11 months after sowing, leucaena yield (1.95 t/ha DM) was higher(P < 0.05) when one furrow of sunflower was intercropped and lower (0.64 t/ha) when 3 furrows of sunflower were sown. The highest yield (P < 0.05) of star grass (2.6 t/ha DM) was attained when 1 or 3 furrows of soybean were intercropped and the lowest was when 3 furrows of sunflower were intercropped between double rows of leucaena (1.4 t/ha DM). It was concluded that the contribution to grain production when 3 furrows of maize or soybean are intercropped is an option to decrease the establishment costs of leucaena and star grass. Soybean had a higher contribution to grain production and it favoured or did not affect biomass production of leucaena and star grass. A single row of sunflower also improved leucaena yield."

Evidence for local adaptation was found in seedling introductions into intact environments and from ecotype colonization success in the first generation after seed dispersal. Estimates of fitness were obtained at particular stages of the life cycle (seed, seedling and adult). Experiments that manipulated the environment (vegetation removal, different plant density) demonstrated the intensity and direction of natural selection in different life history episodes, but there was no strong evidence for local adaptation under these circumstances. The observed genetically determined differences between Mediterranean and desert ecotypes can be summarized as the following: reproductive output was higher in desert plants, with smaller seeds than in Mediterranean plants. There was a higher competitive ability of Mediterranean than desert plants. Plants of desert origin had significant reductions in yield when grown in mixed stands with Mediterranean plants; no such effect was observed for plants of Mediterranean origin. Seed germination and seedling survival was lower in seeds of desert origin. This was due to both: genetically determined higher dormancy of desert seeds and a trade-off between no. of seeds and their size (directly related to seed/seedling vigour)."

The two field trials were conducted with winter peas in either pure stands as winter catch crop for biomass yield (three seasons) or mixed stands with rye as a seed legume (two seasons: seeding rate 20 and 225 germinable seeds m(-2), respectively) on the experimental farm of the University of Kassel, Germany. The main findings suggest that only those genotypes can be recommended for cultivation that have adequate winter hardiness. Results support the conclusion that winter peas have sufficient winter hardiness for cultivation in transitional climatic conditions when they display a rosette growth with small leaves and short internodes at the onset of winter and possess quantitative photoperiodic sensitivity. For these genotypes, no impact of the sowing date on the extent of winter hardiness could be determined. In the experiment winter pea pure stands, the highest biomass yield (assessed at the onset of flowering) was determined for the earliest sowings. In the experiment with winter pea/rye mixture, the influence of sowing date on seed yield of the frost-resistant peas was negligible. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Wheat-pea intercropping allows to decreasing the use of nitrogen fertilization through ecological processes such as niche complementarity and facilitation. Rhizosphere microbial communities may account for these processes, since they play a major role in biogeochemical cycles and impact plant nutrition. Still, knowledge on the effect of intecropping on the rhizosphere microbiota remains scarce. Especially, it is an open question whether rhizosphere microbial communities in cereal-legume intercropping are the sum or not of the microbiota of each plant species cultivated in sole cropping. In the present study, we assessed the impact of wheat and pea in IC on the diversity and structure of their respective rhizosphere microbiota. For this purpose, several cultivars of wheat and pea were cultivated in sole and intercropping. Roots of wheat and pea were collected separately in intercropping for microbiota analyses to allow deciphering the effect of IC on the bacterial community of each plant species/cultivar tested. Our data confirmed the well-known specificity of the rhizosphere effect and further stress the differentiation of bacterial communities between pea genotypes (Hr and hr). As regards the intercropping effect, diversity and structure of the rhizosphere microbiota were comparable to sole cropping. However, a specific co-occurrence pattern in each crop rhizosphere due to intercropping was revealed through network analysis. Bacterial co-occurrence network of wheat rhizosphere in IC was dominated by OTUs belonging to Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Gammaproteobacteria. We also evidenced a common network found in both rhizosphere under IC, indicating the interaction between the plant species; this common network was dominated by Acidobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, with three OTUs belonging to Acidobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Chloroflexi that were identified as keystone taxa.

Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) relay intercropping systems are a mainstay of economic and food security in China. We performed a field experiment to investigate the effects of N fertilizer on N recovery efficiency, crop yield, and N loss rate in wheat-peanut relay intercropping systems in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, China during 2015-2017. The N was applied on the day before sowing, the jointing stage (G30) or the booting stage (G40) of winter wheat, and the anthesis stage (R1) of peanut in the following percentage splits: 50-50-0-0 (Ni), 35-35-0-30 (N2), and 35-0-35-30 (N3), using 300 kg N ha(-1), with 0 kg N ha(-1) (NO) as control. N-15-labeled (20.14 atom %) urea was used to trace the fate of N in microplots. The yields of wheat and peanut increased by 12.4% and 15.4% under the N2 and N3 treatments, relative to those under the Ni treatment. The N-15 recovery efficiencies (15NRE) were 64.9% and 58.1% for treatments N2 and N3, significantly greater than that for the Ni treatment (45.3%). The potential N loss rates for the treatments N2 and N3 were 23.7% and 7.0%, significantly lower than that for treatment Ni (30.1%). Withholding N supply until the booting stage (N3) did not reduce the wheat grain yield; however, it increased the N content derived from N-15-labeled urea in peanuts, promoted the distribution of N-15 to pods, and ultimately increased pod yields in comparison with those obtained by topdressing N at jointing stage (N2). In comparison with N2, the N uptake and N recovery efficiency (NRE) of N3 was increased by 12.0% and 24.1%, respectively, while the apparent N loss decreased by 16.7%. In conclusion, applying N fertilizer with three splits and delaying topdressing fertilization until G40 of winter wheat increased total grain yields and NRE and reduced N loss. This practice could be an environment-friendly N management strategy for wheat-peanut relay intercropping systems in China. (C) 2018 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS.

Field experiment covering 2 ha land was conducted at Ultisol in East Lampung during 2011 growing season. A split plot design was used in this research involving four farmers as replications. Each farmer applied two fertilizer packages for the main plot, i.e., (A) 1/2 dose of recommended NPK + organic fertilizer + biofertilizer, and (B) the recommended dose of NPK. The sub-plot was intercropping system, i.e., (i) the farmer's monoculture cassava technological package, (ii) the improved farmer's monoculture cassava technological package, (iii) intercropping cassava + peanut, and (iv) intercropping cassava + peanut +/ soybean. The results indicated that improvement of plant spacing and NPK fertilization could increase the productivity of the farmer's monoculture cassava technological model by 54-85% of fresh roots. The productivity could be further increased by intercropping cassava with peanut, or intercropping cassava + peanut/+ soybean. The LER of intercropping cassava + peanut was 3.30 when the technological farmer's monoculture cassava was used as the control in the LER calculation and was 1.78 when the improved technological monoculture cassava was used as the control in the LER calculation. In addition, the LER of intercropping cassava + peanut +/soybean was 3.70 and 1.98, respectively, when the calculation of LER considered, respectively, the farmer's monoculture cassava and improved monoculture cassava as the control. The intercropping system significantly increased the net income of monoculture system up to 210% and the higher income was generated by intercropping cassava + peanut +/soybean. The use of organic and biological fertilizer reduced the NPK fertilizer requirement by 50% and significantly increased the benefit-cost ratio.

Based on two year study the net return and B:C ratio under Sesbania-wheat rotation were 17.9% and 7.1% more over pearlmillet-wheat crop rotation, respectively. Among intercropping systems Sesbania sown at 90 cm spacing intercropped with one row ofpearlmillet followed by wheat was the most profitable crop rotation for the farmers who are interested in seed crop of sesbania with net return (Rs 40013/ha) and B:C ratio (1.48) along with highest Sesbania seed yield of (924kg/ha) with an additional pearlmillet yield (743kg/ha) and wheat equivalent yield (6656kg/ha). Sesbania sown at 120 cm spacing intercropped with two rows of pearlmillet followed by wheat was the most profitable crop rotation for fanners, who are more interested in pearlmillet seed crop with the highest net return ( Rs 40593/ha) and B:C ratio (1.48) along with highest pearlmillet seed yield (1344 kg/ha), Sesbania seed yield (762 kg/ha), highest sesbania equivalent yield (1379 kg/ha) and second highest wheat equivalent yield (6661kg/ha) among intercropping systems. So, Sesbania followed by wheat is more profitable over pearlmillet- wheat crop rotation and from sustainability point of view to encourage the farmers for seed production of Sesbania and to get maximum net return, the Sesbania can be intercropped with one or two rows of pearlmillet. Sesbania sole or in combination with pearlmillet as intercrop was found beneficial for soil health improvement in terms of available N,P and K status of soil as compared to pearlmillet sole-wheat rotation.

Energy budgeting and carbon footprint of transgenic cotton-wheat production system through peanut intercropping and FYM addition	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						"Cotton; Carbon footprint; Energy; FYM; Intercropping; Nitrogen; Peanut; Wheat"	"ECONOMIC-ANALYSIS; CROPPING SYSTEMS; NUTRIENT-UPTAKE; USE EFFICIENCY; NITROGEN; MANAGEMENT; GROUNDNUT; EMISSIONS"	Two of the most pressing sustainability issues are the depletion of fossil energy resources and the emission of atmospheric green house gases like carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The aim of this study was to assess energy budgeting and carbon footprint in transgenic cotton-wheat cropping system through peanut intercropping with using 25-50 % substitution of recommended dose of nitrogen (RDN) of cotton through farmyard manure (FYM) along with 100 % RDN through urea and control (0 N). To quantify the residual effects of previous crops and their fertility levels, a succeeding crop of wheat was grown with varying rates of nitrogen, viz. 0, 50, 100, and 150 kg ha(-1). Cotton+ peanut-wheat cropping system recorded 21 % higher system productivity which ultimately helped to maintain higher net energy return (22 %), energy use efficiency (12 %), human energy profitability (3 %), energy productivity (7 %), carbon outputs (20 %), carbon efficiency (17 %), and 11 % lower carbon footprint over sole cotton-wheat cropping system. Peanut addition in cotton-wheat system increased the share of renewable energy inputs from 18 to 21 %. With substitution of 25 % RDN of cotton through FYM, share of renewable energy resources increased in the range of 21 % which resulted into higher system productivity (4 %), net energy return (5 %), energy ratio (6 %), human energy profitability (74 %), energy productivity (6 %), energy profitability (5 %), and 5 % lower carbon footprint over no substitution. The highest carbon footprint (0.201) was recorded under control followed by 50 % substitution of RDN through FYM (0.189). With each successive increase in N dose up to 150 kg N ha(-1) to wheat, energy productivity significantly reduced and share of renewable energy inputs decreased from 25 to 13 %. Application of 100 kg N ha(-1) to wheat maintained the highest grain yield (3.71 t ha(-1)), net energy return (105,516 MJ ha(-1)), and human energy profitability (223.4) over other N doses applied to wheat. Application of 50 kg N ha(-1) to wheat maintained the least carbon footprint (0.091) followed by 100 kg N ha(-1) (0.100). Our study indicates that system productivity as well as energy and carbon use efficiencies of transgenic cotton-wheat production system can be enhanced by inclusion of peanut as an intercrop in cotton and substitution of 25 % RDN of cotton through FYM, as well as application of 100 kg N ha(-1) to succeeding wheat crop.

Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) intercropped With peas prevents lodging, but this facilitative effect of the cereal on the pea has rarely been examined. Two two-factorial experiments (Experiment 1 and Experiment 2) were conducted in 2005, 2006, and 2007 to study interactions between barley and a medium-tall, leafy field pea (Wiato cultivar) and between barley and a tall, leafy field pea (Fidelia cultivar). In both experiments, mineral N fertilizer was used at rates of 0,30, and 60 kg of N ha(-1). Experiment 1 was conducted to evaluate plant lodging, grain yield, the intercrop yield advantage over pure stands and competition between the intercropped species. Experiment 2 was designed to separate the facilitative effect of the mechanical support provided to the peas by the barley in the intercrop from the effects of competition. In the experiment, groups of four pea plants were grown supported by an iron wire frame to prevent their lodging. The frames were kept in the plots until the peas flowered fully or reached full maturity. Similar groups of legumes were also grown in mixtures with nine barley plants. These treatments permitted the determination of the net benefits to the peas of the mechanical support provided by the added barley between pea flowering and maturity. In Experiment 1, there was little lodging of the pea cultivars in the intercrops, whereas the pure stands lodged severely. In all years, the barley-pea intercrops were more productive than the sole crops (LER > 1). The barley-Wiato mixture yielded more grain than the barley-Fidelia mixture in 2005 and 2006. Both mixtures transgressively overyielded in 2006 at the nitrogen fertilizer rate of 30 kg of N ha(-1), and the barley-Wiato mixture did so at 0 kg of N ha(-1). Experiment 2 showed that mechanical plant support (facilitation) was more important for the tall cultivar Fidelia than for the medium-tall cultivar Wiato, but Fidelia was the weaker competitor of the two with barley. Increasing the N fertilizer rates decreased the pea tolerance to competition from barley in the intercrop. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Modelling, by taking into account the complexity of species interactions, can be a very useful tool to study such systems and to test new strategies in various soil and climatic conditions. The present work describes the adaptation of an intercrop model for pea-barley intercrops through the extrapolation of the STICS sole crop model and its parameterisation from experimental data recorded on sole crops. Several improvements have been added to the existing crop model to allow an inversion of dominance in height between species during the crop cycle and a trophic link between crop growth rate and the potential for N-2 fixation. A 2-year dataset on pea and barley sole crops grown under non-limiting water conditions and with full crop protection was first used for calibration. The intercrop model was subsequently tested on experimental datasets of pea-barley intercrops grown under the same conditions as the sole crops. The intercrop experiments used to test the intercrop model differed in soil type, soil N supply and plant densities of each species. The development of the intercrop model through the extrapolation of the sole crop model and its parameterisation from experimental data recorded in sole crops allowed an accurate simulation of the interactions for nitrogen between intercropped species. The Simulated crop growth, N accumulation and N-2 fixation in intercrops were in agreement with the observations from the experimental dataset. Moreover the behaviour of the model was consistent with the general knowledge about those intercropping systems. However the simulation of competition for light needs to be improved, especially the simulation of height growth. A thorough validation on many data sets, independent of those used for parameterisation, is still required. This model needs to be tested under a wider range of situations and for other limiting factors than nitrogen Occurring in low-input farming systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In cereal-legume intercrops, competition for soil nitrogen during the vegetative phase greatly influences the final performance of the intercropped species. However, there is a lack of knowledge on the main factors involved in interspecific soil N competitive interactions between species. The dominance of cereals over legumes is often attributed to their faster growing rooting system. Nevertheless, using only field experimental approaches makes it difficult to isolate the effect of one factor because of the strong interactions between processes and the environment. Given the complexity of intercropping systems, dynamic simulation models can be especially helpful for testing hypotheses about the key factors driving competition between species. The present work was designed to investigate, under non-limiting water conditions, through an experimental and modelling approach, whether differences in root depth penetration among pea and barley grown together determined competition for soil N and dry matter accumulation (DM) by each species during the vegetative phase. This hypothesis was tested through several simulated scenarios generated using the STICS crop model. The model was first used to compare competition for soil N according to differences in root depth penetration rates between species. This rooting depth penetration effect was then studied at three levels of soil N supply leading to different degrees of N demand and N stress. A field experiment carried out in 2003 including pea-barley intercrops grown either with 130 kg N ha(-1) or without any fertilizer was used to test the model. Experimental results of aboveground biomass, nitrogen accumulation, N-2 fixation and rooting depth monitored regularly during the crop cycle were compared to simulated results. The simulated responses of the intercrops were in agreement with the observations from the experimental dataset. Using the model, it is clear that faster root growth in barley gives it access to more soil nitrogen than pea during the vegetative phase. However, this advantage, which is limited to the vegetative phase, only affects the outcome of the intercrop when soil N supply is low. With higher soil N supplies, soil N sharing is not affected by the differences in rooting depth penetration between species. It appears that with higher N supplies, the differences in N demand between species have more influence on species dominance than differences in rooting depth. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

J	"Corre-Hellou, G; Fustec, J; Crozat, Y"				"Corre-Hellou, Guenaelle; Fustec, Joelle; Crozat, Yves"			Interspecific competition for soil N and its interaction with N-2 fixation, leaf expansion and crop growth in pea-barley intercrops	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						"barley; competition; intercropping; N-2 fixation; nitrogen; pea"	"SYMBIOTIC NITROGEN-FIXATION; ROOT; FIELD; YIELD; DYNAMICS; NITRATE"	Field experiments were carried out during three successive years to study through a dynamic approach the competition for soil N and its interaction with N-2 fixation, leaf expansion and crop growth in pea-barley intercrops. The intensity of competition for soil N varied between experiments according to soil N supply and plant densities. This study demonstrates the key role of competition for soil N which occurs early in the crop cycle and greatly influences the subsequent growth and final performance of both species. Relative yield values for grain yield and N accumulation increased with the intensity of competition for soil N. Barley competed strongly for soil N in the intercrop. Its competitive ability increased steadily during the vegetative phase and remained constant after the beginning of pea flowering. The period of strong competition for soil N (500-800 degree-days after sowing) also corresponded to the period of rapid growth in leaf area for both species and therefore an increasing N demand. For each species, the leaf area per plant at the beginning of pea flowering was well correlated with crop nitrogen status. Barley may meet its N needs more easily in intercrops (IC) and has greater leaf area per plant than in sole crops (SC). Barley having a greater soil N supply results in an even higher crop N status and greater competitive ability relative to pea in intercrop. Competition by barley for soil N increased the proportion of pea N derived from fixation. The nitrogen nutrition index (NNI) values of pea were close to 1 whatever the soil N availability in contrast to barley. However N-2 fixation started later than soil N uptake of pea and barley and was low when barley was very competitive for soil N. Due to the time necessary for the progressive development and activity of nodules, N-2 fixation could not completely satisfy N demand at the beginning of the crop cycle. The amount of N-2 fixed per plant in intercrops was not only a response to soil N availability but was largely determined by pea growth and was greatly affected when barley was too competitive.

Carabids were most numerous in yellow lupin monoculture and in the intercrop with the highest proportion of lupin. Important differences between the experimental treatments were found, but they were mostly non-significant because of the great variation between samples. It is supposed that the positive effect Of lupin oil carabid beetles was due to the shelter it provides. During the three-year study 59 species of carabid beetles were recorded. The most abundant species in each treatment was Pseudoophonus rufipes. Irrespective of the experimental treatment, this species was caught in the greatest numbers towards the end of each growing season. This was probably because of the greater soil coverage provided by the larger lupin plants at the end of the season.

The WCP was harvested at the pod swell growth stage. The bi-crops were harvested after 14, 17 and 18 weeks of drilling, when the peas and wheat were respectively at the pod swell and early milk (cut 1), dry seed and early dough (cut 2) and early pod senescence and dough (cut 3) growth stages. The forages were conserved in 600 kg bales without additive treatment for 90 days and then analyzed for chemical composition, aerobic stability, rumen degradation, in vivo digestibility and N balance. The voluntary feed intake, in vivo digestibility and N balance of the bi-crops was measured using 6, 9 month-old, Suffolk cross wethers that were housed in separate metabolism crates. The WCP forage was similarly evaluated in a separate experiment. In situ degradation was measured in three ruminally-fistulated cows fed a perennial ryegrass silage diet without concentrate. The level of peas in the forages at harvest ranged from 90 to 170 g/kg dry matter (DM). The pH, DM and starch contents of the bi-crop silages increased (P < 0.001), while their water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content and fermentation product concentrations decreased (P < 0.01) with maturity. Crude protein content, DM intake, in vivo digestibility, N balance and rumen degradation were higher in WCP than in the bi-crops. Within the bi-crops, intakes of DM, organic matter (OM) and N were highest at cut 2, whereas digestibilities of DM, OM and N were highest at cut 1. Only the cut 1 bi-crop gave a positive N balance. The effective rumen degradability of DM and the N loss after 48 h were higher for cut 1 silages than for cut 2 and cut 3 silages. However, the starch loss after 48 h increased (P < 0.05) with maturity. This study shows that the nutritive value of pea-wheat bi-crops is optimized after 14 weeks of harvest. Since the nutritive value of such low pea (<200 g/k-g DM) bi-crops was considerably poorer than that for WCP, a complementary study is investigating the effect of sward pea content on the nutritive value of pea-wheat bi-crops.

Results showed that wheat + rapeseed was the best combination for getting yield advantage in intercropping over wheat + pea and rapeseed + pea as judged by wheat equivalent yield and various competitive functions like land-equivalent ratio and aggressivity. Among the proportions 1 : 1 was found to be the most favourable. Yield advantage in wheat + pea and rapeseed + pea combination was also observed except at 1 : 3 sowing proportion. Either with wheat or rapeseed when the sowing proportion of pea was more than 50%, intercropping became disadvantageous.

Merr.] is sown into standing wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), alleviates several problems associated with delayed soybean sowings following wheat in a double-cropping system. However, relay intercropping has resulted in wheat yield reductions at some locations. Little information is available on the relative performance of wheat cultivars in this system or on the effect of wheat cultivar on performance of the soybean crop. This 2-y study compared performance of relay intercropped versus sequentially double-cropped wheat and soybean and determined the influence of wheat cultivar on performance of wheat and the succeeding soybean crop. Three wheat cultivars were sown in a relay intercropping pattern (33-cm-wide rows with two 61-cm-wide traffic lanes per 11-row planter pass) and in a conventional double-cropping pattern (18-cm-wide rows). Intercropped soybean was sown between wheat rows 19 (1991) or 27 (1992) days before wheat harvest. Double-cropped soybean was sown in 97-cm rows after wheat harvest. Averaged over cultivars and years, intercropped wheat yield was 18% less than double-cropped wheat due to fewer spikes per unit area. No consistent cultivar by cropping system interaction occurred for wheat yield or yield components. The exception was that, in 1991, 'Williams' wheat harl similar yields in both cropping systems, but its yields in both systems were very low. In the intercropped system, yields (on an area basis) were less in rows bordering traffic lanes than in interior rows. Double-cropped soybean plants were taller at harvest, but intercropped soybean had longer lower internodes and higher lodging scores. However, relay-intercropped and double-cropped soybean yields were similar, and independent of the previous wheat cultivar.

Present study revealed that yield attributes and yield of pigeonpea were not adversely affected by different planting patterns and nutrient levels applied to intercrop during both the years. Pigeonpea planted at 50 x 25 cm with maize fodder as intercrop recorded highest pigeonpea equivalent yield of 1840 and 1895 kg/ha during 2015 and 2016, respectively. Application of 100% recommended dose of nutrient to intercrop also significantly increased the pigeonpea equivalent yield (1629 and 1732 kg/ha) over 50% of recommended dose and control during both years. Pigeonpea (50 x 25 cm) + maize fodder fetched significantly higher net returns (Rs. 61191 and 68764/ha), B: C (1.7 and 2.0) and per day income (Rs. 453 and 509/ha/day) than other intercropping systems during both the years.

Nitrogen-fixing legumes were cultivated between rows of wheat or barley grown at low levels of soil nitrogen, and mostly under rainfed conditions, in Mexico between 1989 and 1992. None of the legumes tested reduced yields of the cereal crop in comparison to controls where cereal yields were in the range of 1-4 t/ha, while the extra total biomass from legumes in some cases more than doubled productivity. Different legume crops were tested to demonstrate the adaptability of the system to the varying needs of farmers. The intercropped legumes achieved dry biomass yields as high as 6.5 t/ha in the case of a sequentially cropped forage crop of hairy vetch, or 1.4 t/ha of dry beans plus 3.5 t/ha of green residue in the case of Vicia faba. Total biomass in the intercropped situation gave land equivalent ratios as high as 1.54. Light measurements inside the crop canopies indicated that the intercropped systems intercepted a higher proportion of the incident solar radiation than the cereal monocrop, presumably accounting for the large differences in total biomass produced. In addition, with leaf nitrogen levels of 3.8%, it is assumed that the intercropped legumes fixed considerably more nitrogen than was removed by the wheat crop. The potential of the system to stabilize erodible soils by increasing ground cover as well as by raising inputs of soil organic matter is discussed.

Soil total Zn and Cd concentrations decreased markedly after long-term phytoextraction. But shoot biomass and Cd and Zn concentrations showed no significant difference with increasing remediation time. In the intercropping experiment the phytoremediation efficiency in the treatment S. plumbizincicola intercropped with maize was higher than in S. plumbizincicola monocropping, and Cd concentrations of corn were below the maximum national limit. In the plant density experiment the phytoremediation efficiency increased with increasing plant density and 440,000 plants ha(-1) gave the maximum rate. These results indicated that S. plumbizincicola at an appropriate planting density and intercropped with maize can achieve high remediation efficiency to contaminated soil without affecting the cereal crop productivity. This cropping system combines adequate agricultural production with soil heavy metal phytoextraction.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) from co-cultivated intercropped plants may proliferate into the microsites and interact with soil microbes to reduce N2O emissions. Yet, the mechanisms by which or how mycorrhizal hyphae affect nitrifiers and denitrifiers in the legume residues remain ambiguous. Here, a split-microcosm experiment was conducted to assess hyphae of Rhizophagus aggregatus from neighbouring maize on overall N2O emissions from stubbles of nodulated or non-nodulated soybean. Soil microbes from fields intercropped with maize/soybean amended with fertilizer nitrogen (SS-N1) or unamended (SS-N0) were added to the soybean chamber only. AMF hyphae consistently reduced N2O emissions by 20.8%-61.5%. Generally, AMF hyphae promoted the abundance of N2O-consuming (nosZ-type) denitrifiers and altered their community composition. The effects were partly associated with increasing MBC and DOC. By contrast, AMF reduced the abundance of nirK-type denitrifiers in the nodulated SS-N0 treatment only and that of AOB in the non-nodulated SS-N1 treatment. Taken together, our results show that AMF reduced N2O emissions from soybean stubbles, mainly through the promotion of N2O-consuming denitrifiers.

Separating corn and soybean with a small grain strip could decrease competition for soybean and improve overall yield. This study was conducted to determine the effect of a small grain strip on corn and soybean performance and on soil water content in the corn strip. Corn and soybean were strip-intercropped (rows running north-south) with oat (Avena sativa L.) in 1991 and barley (Hordeum vulgare L. emend. Lam.) in 1992 on a ridge-tilled Dalhousie silt loam (fine, mixed, mesic Typic Endoaquoll) in Nepean, Ontario. Both years, plant height varied among corn rows. In 1992, plant development was faster and grain moisture at harvest was lower in corn border rows than in non-border rows. In 1991 and 1992, soil water was depleted earlier in the corn and small grain interrow than in the corn and soybean interrow. In 1991, a hot and dry growing season, yield of the corn row next to small grain was 20% lower than that of other corn rows. In 1992, a wet and cool growing season, both corn border rows yielded yielded 26% more than nonborder rows, partly due to increased number of ears per plant. Both years, soybean yield in the row bordering small grain was similar to that of nonborder rows but yield in the row bordering corn was 18% lower than that of nonborder rows. Including a small grain in corn and soybean strip-cropping can be beneficial if soil moisture is not limiting.

Intercropping primed seeds with Phaseolus vulgaris L. did not affect germination percentage but reduced germination speed as compared to primed, monocropped seeds. This was ascribed to effects of competition for water and to seed size. Neither priming treatment nor cropping system affected seedling growth in the genotypes studied. Priming treatments with PEG and other additives increased the speed of germination. The PEG and PEG + Sucrose treatments yielded the highest germination percentages, and PEG + GA(3) the highest germination speed. Mixing PEG with NaCl or ascorbic acid yielded lower germination percentages and longer germination periods.

The hypothesis of this study was that sowing maize and marandu palisadegrass with the presence of grazing animals might cause short-term changes in soil indicator responses. We compared four intercropping techniques: ICLS-1: maize plus marandu palisadegrass sown simultaneously, without herbicide; ICLS-2: maize plus marandu palisadegrass sown simultaneously, with herbicide; ICLS-3: maize plus marandu palisadegrass in lagged sowing (i.e., marandu palisadegrass sown 20 days after maize sowing); ICLS-4: maize plus marandu palisadegrass sown simultaneously (palisadegrass on the rows and inter-rows, with herbicide). Two control treatments in monoculture (i.e., grass and maize monocultures) represented the conventional systems. The soil was sampled three times over a one-year period, for the evaluation of carbon and nitrogen fractions as affected by seasonal variability. Results indicated that ICLS-1 and ICLS-4 enhanced soil quality more quickly during the seasonal variation. The ICLS-2 negatively affected microbial biomass (22%), resulting in reduced labile carbon (43%), carbon management index (33%), and potentially mineralizable nitrogen (20%). Labile carbon and the carbon management index were more sensitive and efficient indicators for verifying soil quality changes in the short-term. Results indicated that there is large variability in these soil indicators during the annual cycle, and further studies are needed to verify the effects of the tested systems on different soil nitrogen fractions and how they affect available nitrogen in the short-term. However, potentially mineralizable nitrogen can provide positive insights for short-term changes in the soil."

The objectives of this study were: (i) to determine the response of varying levels of potassium (K) fertilizer to plantain when grown as sole or intercropped with selected arable crops such as melon, maize, and cassava and (ii) to determine the critical limit of K in the soil at 90% relative plantain bunch yield. The experimental design was a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four replications. The treatments were four cropping systems: sole plantain (SP), plantain + melon (PME), plantain + maize (PMA), and plantain + cassava (PCA). Five levels of potassium fertilizers were used: 0, 120, 240, 360, and 480 kg K ha(-1). The results showed that bunch yield of plantain at harvesting, the cropping systems follows the order: PME > SP > PCA > PMA. Highest bunch yield of about 10.39 t ha(-1) were obtained with PME intercropping at the rate of 360 kg K ha(-1). At varying levels of K fertilizers significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed amongst the following morphological parameters: 50% days to shooting, plant height, number of suckers/stool as well as number of fingers/bunch. Cate and Nelson model showed that when these data are pooled, optimum soil test K was between 0.20 and 0.21 cmol kg(-1).

This study was conducted to estimate soil losses from plots of different agricultural land management using the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) (95.7) model. The study took place in a semiarid region in Kenya. The mean annual rainfall was 694 mm. The WEPP (95.7) model was initially used to estimate total sediment loading from the catchment into a reservoir. The estimate was about 2871 t corresponding to an average sedimentation rate of 1063 t km(-2) year-(1), which was about 76% of the measured total sediment inflow into the reservoir. Soil losses were estimated within 10 plots on the catchment of different sizes and slopes with the following treatments: conventional tillage (hand hoeing) with maize and soybean intercropping (HOCOBE); conservation tillage (disc plough) with maize and soybean intercropping (COBEAN); conservation tillage with only maize cultivation (CNTCORN); and conservation tillage with only soybean cultivation (CNTBEAN). The soil loss reduction of COBEAN, CNTCORN and CNTBEAN relative to HOCOBE ranged between 27-47%, 16-29% and 12-25%, respectively, depending on the size and slope of the plot. In general, conservation tillage reduced soil loss relative to conventional tillage. However, with conservation tillage, the single cropping system resulted in greater soil loss than the intercropping system. In the case of single cropping with conservation tillage, the soil loss reduction for maize ranged between 4 and 9%, relative to soybean. Overall, the study showed that there would be a significant reduction of soil losses from plots if conservation tillage with an intercropping system (maize and soybean) were to be adopted on agricultural lands in semiarid regions."

Merr.; growth retardant; morphological characters soybean; third trifoliolate stage; uniconazole"	"SHADE; CHLOROPHYLL; HORMONES; QUALITY; YIELD"	Due to light limit under maize/soybean relay strips intercropping system, soybean is thin and weak at seedling stage. Uniconazole is a plant growth retardant that could reduce plant stem elogation and increase lateral growth. For a better understanding, the respose of soybean to uniconazole at V-4 (The third trifoliolate leaf fully developed), morphological characters such as the height, the diameter of stem, the leaf morphological and the content of chlorophyll of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr] cv. Gongxuan 1 was studied. The results showed that plant hight and stem slenderness ratio (H : D) decreased and stem diameter increased after seed treatment with uniconazole powder (0, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 mg/kg seed). Uniconazole also significantly increased the petiole length, leaf length and leaf width. In addition, it enhanced the content of chlorophyll and the ratio of chl a and chl b. Thus, results suggested that uniconazole treatment could improve plant growth which would be conducive to greater use of light source areas and favourable to gain light sources efficiently.

A study was conducted to assess the N fertilizer efficiency in four private farms in intensively cropped areas of NW Italy, and to monitor the effects of agricultural practices on the mineral N concentration of the soil solution, sampled every 2 weeks for 2 years and considered as an indicator of potential leaching. Two cultivation systems were compared in each farm, one involving continuous maize rotation, the other assuring a continuous soil cover (permanent meadow or winter cereal-maize double cropping system). The fertilization level in the arable crops was high (369-509 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) compared to the crop removals, and resulted in a low efficiency, as indicated by the four examined efficiency indexes (calculated N surplus, N removal-fertilizer ratio, N apparent recovery, N use efficiency). The soil-water-nitrate concentration showed large temporal variations in the range of 1-150 mg l(-1) for five out of the eight cropping situations, while concentrations smaller than 10 mg l(-1) were always recorded in the meadows and in one of the four soils (Aeric epiaquept). The fertilizer management that characterized each cropping system affected the soil-mineral-nitrate content in shallow arable soils. The longer soil cover duration in double-cropping systems did not result in a reduction of soil N compared to maize as a single crop, not even in winter (the bare-soil intercropping period in maize-based systems). However, the temporal oscillations of the concentration were buffered by the crop cover duration and by the presence of a shallow water table (1 m deep) in the soil profile. The average nitrate content of the soil could be predicted by the N uptake of the crop, the N removal-fertilizer ratio, the soil pH and sand content, however no simple explanatory relationship was found with the experimental factors. Hence, in farm conditions, in the absence of sufficient data for a deterministic model approach, the target of reducing the risk of leaching should be achieved by maximizing the fertilizer efficiency.

For successful organic farming, efficient cropping systems and organic amendments are to be identified to sustain soil health on one hand and productivity and enhanced income on the other. The efficacy of three organic amendments, namely, farmyard manure (FYM), vermicompost (VC) and integrated nutrient source (INS; 50% recommended dose of nitrogen (N) through FYM + 50% N through VC) on performance of three-vegetable-based cropping systems, namely, maize + soybean (2:2 intercropping)-tomato, maize + soybean-potato and maize + soybean-French bean was evaluated for five consecutive years (2005-06 to 2009-10) under subtropical climate at Umiam, Meghalaya, India (950 m above sea level). All the organic amendments were applied on N equivalent basis and phosphorus (P) requirement was compensated through rock phosphate. The results revealed that the yield of vegetables, except root vegetables, was maximum with FYM as soil amendment. Total system productivity in terms of maize equivalent yield (MEY) was significantly higher under FYM followed by INS. Pooled analysis revealed that MEY was enhanced by 200 and 191% with continuous application of FYM and INS, respectively, over control (no manure). Maize + soybean-tomato system recorded the highest MEY (28.78 Mg ha(-1); Mg - megagram) followed by maize + soybean-French bean (24.37 Mg ha(-1)). INS as organic amendment resulted in maximum improvement in soil organic carbon (SOC), available P and potassium (K), soil microbial biomass carbon and water holding capacity and was similar to those under FYM. The SOC concentration under INS (23.6 g kg(-1)), FYM (23.3 g kg(-1)) and VC (22.3 g kg(-1)) after five years of organic farming were 31.0, 29.4 and 23.8% higher than the initial and 26.2, 24.6 and 19.3% higher than those under control, respectively. The quality traits of tomato such as total soluble solids (5%), ascorbic acid (28.6 mg 100 g(-1)) and lycopene content (19.35 mg 100 g(-1)) were higher under FYM application than other amendments. The study indicated that FYM and INS are equally good as organic amendment and their continuous application not only improves soil health but also crop productivity. FYM application was also found to be cost effective as it resulted in a higher benefit: cost ratio (4.4:1) compared to other amendments irrespective of cropping sequences during transition to organic farming."

The crop multiple cropping and peanut monocropping (M) were established in 2002 and fertilizer was applied to any plots. We hypothesize that peanut/cowpea multiple cropping harbour a greater microfauna diversity, while organic mature application support a more complex soil food web and soil functioning. Combined the two factors implies a beneficial soil ecosystem for peanut production via repelling PPNs. The results showed microbial C and N over the growing season were 39.2% and 30.7% greater when peanut was intercropped and relaycropped than in monocropping plots. Total organic C, total N and alkali hydrolysable N were average 24.6%-43.1% greater when organic manure was applied than in the chemical fertilizer plots. Soil nematode community in peanut monocropping was dominated by plant parasites, mainly from Meloidogyne spp., but their abundance decreased when cowpea was associated to peanut. The cowpea also impacted other trophic groups. The proportion of bacterivores and high colonizer-persister (c-p) value omnivore-carnivores was increased in multi-cropping plots. The abundance of protozoa and fungivores were 36.9% and 29.8% greater in mixed manure plots than in no fertilization plots at flowering stage. The increased diversity indices (H') and ecological indices (EI and SI) of the nematode communities indicated less disturbance and high soil fertility in multiple cropping systems. Overall, peanut multicropping with manure had a positive effect on peanut rhizosphere soil conditions."

The present work was conducted with the objective of identify the best intercrop modality of three species of brachiaria (Brachiaria brizantha, B. decumbens and B. ruziziensis) with fall maize (row, interrow, interrow at the moment of maize coverage fertilization) in the pasture-agriculture integration system. It was used a randomized block design in a factorial scheme (3x3) with four repetitions evaluating dry weight of maize straw, dry matter of pasture straw, total dry weight of straw, 1000 grain weight and grain yield. The results showed that when the main focus of intercropping maize with pasture for grain yield and the secondary focus is the formation of straw, the use of Brachiaria ruziziensis sown at the time of maize manuring led to the highest grain yield. All treatments produced sufficient quantity of straw to maintain the stability of no tillage.

J	Kumar, D				Kumar, D			Status and direction of arid legumes research in India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Review						"arid legumes; improvement; production; protection; gum content"	"HORSEGRAM MACROTYLOMA-UNIFLORUM; VIGNA-UNGUICULATA; COWPEA CULTIVARS; MOSAIC-VIRUS; INSECT PESTS; WATER-STRESS; RESISTANCE; YIELD; CROP; DRYLAND"	Arid legumes are recognized for taming droughts, sustaining soil health and diversifying agriculture and for providing organic food, feed and variety of products of industrial use of export value. Considerable research results have been generated at various levels for making them more productive. In moth bean [ Vigna aconitifolia (Jacq) Marechal], varieties maturing in 58-60 ('FMM 96'), 61-64 ('RMO 40', 'RMO 225', 'CAZRI Moth Y), 65-67 ('CAZRI Moth 2 and 7075 ('CAZRI Moth 3', 'Jawala', 'IPCMO 880') days having erect, semi-crect and semi-spreading types, respectively, compared with traditional types maturing in 90-100 days with spreading behaviour, have been developed. These varieties, suited to various rainfall situation of 150-500 mm, are highly productive (500-800 kg/ha) with tendency to escape yellow mosaic virus and drought. In horsegram [Macrotyloma uniflorum (Lain.) Verd.] also, varieties maturing in 80-85 days ('AK 21', 'AK 42') compared with traditional ones maturing in 100-110 days have been developed. Promising varieties in clusterbean or guar [Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taubert] ('RGC 986', 'RGC 1003', 'RGC 1002', 'RGC 1017', 'RGM 112') and in cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp] ('GC 3', 'V 585', 'V 240', 'RC 101', 'CoVu 702') have been developed, showing improved grain yield and field tolerance to important diseases. Large number of varieties available in active seed chain (35-40) owe their origin from germplasm collected from various situations. Promising donor of diseases arid insect-pests are available in cowpea. Workable indices of practical significance for drought tolerance have been provided in moth bean and cowpea. Genetical studies revealed preponderance of both additive and non-additive gene effects for important yield traits arid grain yield, however quality traits are less complex. Clusterbean or guar-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.emend. Fiori & Paol) or guar-Indian mustard [Brassica juncea (L.) Czernj. & Cosson] sequences, proved quite profitable in north India. In Southern states, growing short-duration horsegram with rice (Oryza saliva L.) by replacing cowpca is useful arid in Orissa horsegram is successfully taken after rice or maize or sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] crops. Beneficial effects of intercropping clusterbean with pearlmillet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br. emend. Stuntz] sorghum, maize and castor (Ricinus communis L.) have been observed at various places. Intercropping I or 2 rows of cowpea between 2 rows of pigeonpea, maize, pearl millet or sorghum have ensured success of crops without loss to the main crop. Mixing of moth bean and pearl millet seeds (as two-thirds and one-third of recommended dose, respectively) resulted in highest moth bean equivalent grain yield even under late-sown rainfed conditions of Rajasthan. Moth bean kept weed-free up to 20-25 days after sowing gave satisfactory grain yield, Among chemical weedicides, Basalin @ 1 kg ai/ha effectively controlled weeds in moth bean and guar. In cowpea Pendemethalin @ 0.75 kg/ha + 1 hand-weeding at 35 days after sowing gave least weed index (18.0), higher grain yield (502 kg/ha) and benefit: cost ratio (1.69) than weeded check. Bacteria] leaf blight (Xanthomonas axonopodis pv cyamopsidis Patel), alternaria leaf spot (Alternaria cucumerina var cyamopsidis), anthracnose (Collelotrichum lindemuthianum (Sacc. & Magn.) Bri. & Cav.], dry root rot [Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid], powdery mildew [Odiopsis taurica (Lev.) Sain], fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f sp tracheiphilum), yellow mosaic virus arid cowpea yellow mosaic virus are important diseases of and legumes, causing considerable yield loss (10-95%). Control measures through chemical, organic and biological means have been developed. Among insects, more than 25% yield losses have been observed due to storage beetles or bruchids (Callosobruchus maculatus Fab.). Edible oil treatment (8 ml/kg seed) proved effective up to 150-200 days against storage pests. Pod-borer [Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner)] is another main pest damaging cowpea and horsegram. Spray of 0.07% endosulphan @ 700 litres/ha has been effective to check the same. Galactomannan guar gum, a polysaccharide compound, is used in a number of industries where water is an important factor. Cluster bean varieties with higher gum content (> 32%) and high viscosity (4000-5000 mps.a) are preferred for export. Clusterbean meal obtained from seed coat and germ cell is important feed of monogastric animals and has high proportion of protein content (45-50%). Cowpea and moth bean varieties having almost 27 and 25-26% grain protein are available, whereas horsegram varieties may contain even up to 30% crude protein.

Influence of cassava (Manihot esculenta) intercrop on growth and fruit yields of pepper (Capsicum spp.) in south-western Nigeria	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article							"OKRA ABELMOSCHUS-ESCULENTUS; CROPPING SYSTEMS; RAINY-SEASON; MAIZE; TEMPERATURE; MIXTURE; MELON; SOIL"	"In tropical Africa, pepper (Capsicum spp.) is grown as a rainfed crop, and its production is limited by the long; hot growing season. Field experiments were conducted in Nigeria to evaluate the effects of cassava (Manihot esculenta) oil the growth and yields of three pepper cultivars and gross returns in 2001-2003. In Experiment 1, pepper (cv. Sombo) was planted between rows of cassava cvs Idileru (PI), Odongbo (PO) and TMS 30572 (PT). In Experiment 2, pepper cvs Sombo, Tatase and Atarodo, were mixed with TMS 30572 (MS; MT or MA). The growth environment for the intercropped pepper differed from sole crops of pepper. Radiant energy reaching the soil surface, maximum diurnal soil and canopy temperatures, and weed growth were lower with intercropping, with the lowest values being observed in the PI and PT intercrops. Similarly. soil moisture content and the number of earthworm casts were greater with intercropping, with the highest values also Occurring in the PI and PT intercrops. In both experiments, fresh fruit yields of pepper depended on the duration of harvest, the number of fruits per plant and the weight of fruits. In Experiment 1, although the number of fruits and fruit yield of cv. Sombo were greater in the sole crop (SP) than the PO intercrop, the fruit yields in the PI and PT intercrops were similar to those of the SP plot. In Experiment 2, the number of fruits and yield of intercropped pepper cvs Tatase, Sornbo and Atarodo were 25-28 % higher, on average, than in pure stands. Cassava tuber yield was not affected by intercropped pepper in either experiment. Total gross returns were greater than growing either pepper or cassava in monoculture. Increased total gross returns in the intercrops were obtained in the PI and PT treatments and in the MS and MA treatments without a significant reduction in pepper fruit yield. By promoting early fruit set and harvest, and bearing in mind the cumulative gross returns, mixing pepper and cassava enhanced the value of the vegetable, as early fresh pepper fruits command a premium price. It is concluded that pepper can be grown between cassava rows to provide a Suitable environment for growth, but that this depends on the cassava cultivar. Using the less tall early cassava cultivar, with a relatively moderate leaf area index in a mixture with pepper is therefore recommended."

As such, the aim of this study was to evaluate the operational and energy performance of a ridge planter and fertiliser, as well as the deposition depth of maize seeds and fertiliser as a function of the sowing system, and the use of different furrowing mechanisms (disc and shank) for depositing fertilisers. The experimental design was of randomised blocks, in a 6 x 2 factorial scheme with four replications, including six sowing systems: (S1 - intercropped ridge-sown maize; S2 - monocropped ridge-sown maize; S3 - intercropped furrow-sown maize; S4 - monocropped furrow-sown maize; S5 - conventional intercropping system; S6 - conventional monocropped system) and two mechanisms for depositing the fertiliser (offset double disc and shank furrower). The statistical analysis was carried out using the SISVAR software at 5% significance. It was concluded that, irrespective of the sowing system (ridge or furrow) and mechanism employed, there is no difference in the initial plant population or in the depth of the maize seeds. However, greater attention must be paid to the depth of both the fertiliser and forage seeds when these are deposited at the same time. Sowing systems that turn the soil (furrow and ridge) consume more energy, as does the shank mechanism. Sowing system S5 affords better operating performance when used together with the disk mechanism."

A completely randomized design with six replicates was used, in which growth was evaluated in a silvopastoral system at distances of 2.5 and 5.0 m from the trees and under full sunlight. The dry mass of Marandu palisadegrass was higher under full sunlight (4,074.1 kg/ha) compared to the silvopastoral system (2,283.4 kg/ha) and for the distance of 5.0 m (2,708.1 kg/ha) compared to 2.5 m (1,858.7 kg/ha). The dry mass of Stylosanthes was not influenced by the cultivation system or distance from the trees and was 134.0 kg/ha. The participation of Stylosanthes in the botanical composition was lower under full sunlight (3.59%) compared to the silvopastoral system and lower for 5.0 m (4.76%) compared to 2.5 m (7.32%). Full sunlight also stimulated tillering, percentage of stems and height of Marandu palisadegrass and reduced its leaf: stem ratio.

This practice could be an effective cost-saving alternative to reduce frequent fungicide applications. Research was conducted from 2011 to 2014 on a simulated golf fairway and examined dollar spot severity responses in a mixed-stand of creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) and annual bluegrass (Poa annua ssp. reptans) to sand topdressing and rolling. Treatments consisted of biweekly sand topdressing, rolling at three frequencies (one, three, or five times weekly), a control, and three replications. Infection was visually estimated. Sand topdressing significantly (P < 0.05) reduced disease up to 50% at the peak of the dollar spot activity in 2011, 2013, and 2014. Results on the effects of rolling on dollar spot were inconsistent.

J	"Moynihan, JM; Simmons, SR; Sheaffer, CC"				"Moynihan, JM; Simmons, SR; Sheaffer, CC"			Intercropping annual medic with conventional height and semidwarf barley grown for grain	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							"FORAGE; YIELD; ALFALFA; CLOVER; CORN"	Interseeding annual legumes with grain crops has been proposed as a cropping strategy to enhance ground cover, thereby reducing weed competition, suppressing soil erosion, and providing N for use by subsequent crops. The potential of annual medics (Medicago spp.) for intercropping in small-grain cropping systems has not been adequately assessed for the north-central United States. Our objective was to evaluate a spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)-annual medic intercrop system for barley grain yield, fall biomass production, suppression of fall weeds, and quantity of N available for incorporation into the soil. Field experiments were conducted in four Minnesota environments (Becker, Morris, Rosemount, and St. Paul). Conventional height 'Robust' and semidwarf 'Royal' barley were intercropped with each of three medic species ['George' black medic (M. lupulina L.), 'Mogul' barrel medic (M. truncatula Gaertn.) and 'Santiago' burr medic (M. polymorpha L.)]. Intercropping with medics reduced barley yields by an average of 6% at Rosemount, 30% at St. Paul, and 76% at Becker, compared with monoculture barley fertilized with N. Medics increased yields by 9% at Morris. Intercropping with medic reduced fall weed mass by an average of 65% across environments, compared with the fertilized Royal monoculture. Nitrogen available for incorporation from the barley-medic intercrops ranged from 66 to 140 kg ha(-1) over the environments, whereas N available for incorporation from fertilized barley monoculture ranged from 22 to 80 kg ha(-1) We conclude that the prospects for successfully intercropping with annual medic in a barley grain production system are mixed and depend in part on the medic species used and barley stature. A wider array of medic types should be evaluated for their suitability in intercropping with small grains.

The experimental arrangement was in a 2x12 factorial scheme [two soil type (clayey and sandy) and twelve crops], in a randomized block design, with three replications. At 55 days after sowing the crops, the plant dry mass, number of tiller and height of the ruzigrass were evaluated; leaf area and dry mass of annual crops. The dry mass of ruzigrass was calculated in the intercropping in relation to its single crop. The data were submitted to analysis of variance and the means grouped by the Scott-Knott test (p < 0.05). The ruzigrass produced 78% and 55% by mass; and 2.2 and 1.6 tillers per plant in the clayey and sandy soil, respectively.

The soil productivity and yield contributions of ground akidi (Sphenostylis stenocarpa), pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan), kafanji (Vigna unguiculata), and an improved cowpea cultiver (IAR-355) to the main crops in fertilizer equivalent were assessed. Also evaluated were the effects of cassava, yam and maize on the yield potentials of legume cover crops. Fertilizer applied at multiple rates to cassava and/or yam crops were used to determine levels of legume contributions to soil productivity improvement. Those applied to maize/legume mixtures were used to determine the influence of cover crops on maize response to applied fertilizer. Data were collected on yields of grains, tubers, biomass, nodules and root density. Competition effects were shown when cassava, yam and maize reduced the grain yield of legumes by 20-30%; root density and nodule yields were increased from 0.44 g/m(2) in sole legumes to about 1.11 g/m(2) in legume/cassava intercrop. Root weight was increased from 0.92 to 2.20 g/m(2) in ground akidi intercropped with cassava. Similar increases were observed in kafanji. Legume crops depressed the response coefficient of maize to applied fertilizer; an estimated 250 kg grain/kg NPK were gained by the use of kafanji or its improved version (IAR 355) as cover crops for fertilized maize. In yam, an equivalent of 25-40 kg/ha NPK were contributed by cover crops. About 1.12 and 1.61 tones of cassava tubers were gained by the use of kafanji and ground akidi respectively as cover crops."

Intercropping black oat (Avena strigosa) and annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) can increase pasture leaf production compared with their monocultures	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE			English	Article						"annual grasses; forage production; leaf production; mixture; morphogenesis; ontogeny"	"INTERMITTENT STOCKING; GRASSLAND ECOSYSTEMS; EUROPEAN GRASSLANDS; PLANT DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; MANAGEMENT; MIXTURES; SWARDS; PERFORMANCE; SENESCENCE"	Multi-species pastures have been viewed as a means to increase forage production relative to monocultures through enhanced three-dimensional occupation of the canopy, which will intercept and use the incident radiation more efficiently. For this to occur, increased production of photosynthetically active tissues such as leaves is required. We tested the hypothesis that intercropping of black oats (Avena strigosa Schum.) and annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) can increase total and leaf forage production compared with their monocultures. Monocultures and mixed pastures of black oat and annual ryegrass were established, and their tiller morphogenetic and structural traits, as well as components of herbage production, were measured throughout the usage period of the pastures. There was no difference between treatments for total growth rate (77.1kg dry matter (DM)ha(-1)day(-1)), but annual ryegrass pastures presented the greatest stem growth rate (38.1kg DMha(-1)day(-1)). Taking into account only the vegetative phase, the intercropped pasture produced 20% more leaf than the monocultures. There were no differences between species, either in monoculture or intercropped, for phyllochron, final leaf length, leaf elongation duration and leaf elongation rate. The most important modification in morphogenetic variables due to the inter-specific competition was an increase in senescence rate of annual ryegrass leaves. The average specific green leaf weight in the intercropping pastures corresponded to 84.6% and 137.5% of those values observed for black oat and annual ryegrass pastures, respectively. On the other hand, the intercropping pastures presented 43.5% more tillers than the black oat pastures and 17.8% fewer tillers than the annual ryegrass pastures. It is suggested that intercropping black oat and annual ryegrass does not change tiller ontogenetic processes and that the association of their different size and shape in intercropped pastures could increase pasture leaf production over their monocultures.

The research was carried out in off-season between February and June 2015, in Rio Verde, Goias (Brazil). In the experimental period the rainfall was 865 mm and the average temperature of 23.7 degrees C. Two trials were performed. The first had com rows spaced in 1 m with a row of soybeans in the interrow. The second had double corn rows interspersed with one row of soybeans, all spaced in 0.50 m. In both trials, we used a randomized block design, in a 2x2+3 factorial scheme, with four replications. Primary factor consisted of two types of pre-sowing fertilization: one only in corn rows and the other over the total area. The secondary factor corresponded to two soybean varieties: medium and late cycle variety. In addition, three control treatments were made: one of corn and two of soybeans. The corn cutoff point was at the hard farinaceous stage when the milk line reaches half the grain, and in the sole crop soybean at the R5.5 final phase of grain filling. Silage was stored in PVC experimental silos for 60 days. The intercropped treatments, in both spatial arrangements, promoted increases in neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber contents. Soybean monoculture presented high values of crude protein and ethereal extract. There were higher effluent losses in medium-cycle soybean variety silage when it was grown in single cropping. However, the lowest effluent losses were recorded for silages of medium-cycle soybean intercropped under a double row pre-sowing corn fertilization system. The soybeans mixed silages produced together with corn under off-season conditions did not yield satisfactory results.

Although soil shading and additional nitrogen made some contribution to the reduction of S. hermonthica infestation, an allelopathic mechanism associated with the intercrop. was a major factor. Root exudates of D. uncinatum contain novel flavonoid compounds, some of which stimulate germination of S. hermonthica and others dramatically inhibit its subsequent development, including radicle growth. Desmodium spp. have been developed as intercrops for both maize and sorghum and are now being evaluated for millet. From the experience with Desmodium spp., there is now the possibility for producing edible legumes suitable for intercropping with maize and other cereals to respond to a broader profile of farmer practices. These legumes would incorporate the powerful S. hermonthica controlling properties of D. uncinatum through feasible breeding programmes, with appropriate contributions from analytical chemistry to plant molecular genetics and biotechnology. In the longer term, it may also be possible to transfer genes associated with the allelopathic attributes to cereals themselves by heterologous gene expression, creating a new generation of parasitic weed-free cereals.

The results showed that GM application increased soil organic matter (SOM), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and electrical conductivity (EC) by 41%, 82%, and 35%, respectively, while the soil pH decreased by similar to 0.3 units. These changes were associated with enhanced soil bioavailability of Zn (14%), Cu (26%), and Ni (20%) and improved shoot dry matter yield of the plants. Soil metal bioavailability was also found to be enhanced due to the presence of plant roots. Canola intercropped with corn produced greater individual plant dry weights (IPDWs) of 96% and 59% in the untreated and GM-amended rhizoboxes, respectively. The intercropped corn, however, recorded 25% and 6.4% lower IPDW values in unamended and GM-amended soils, respectively, as compared to the monocropped corn. Enhanced Zn, Cu, and Ni uptakes were observed in canola shoots, while they decreased in corn shoots. The results demonstrate the importance of organic amendment and intercropping strategies for managing metal uptake by plants grown in metal-rich soils.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether crop succession and N splitting fertilization promote differences in the technological quality of common bean grains. The experiment was carried out during winter over two agricultural years in southeastern Brazil. A randomized block design was used in a split-plot scheme, with four replications. The plots were composed of three crop successional systems (maize sole, maize + Urochloa ruziziensis, U. ruziziensis sole) and the subplots contained nine combinations of N splitting fertilization at a rate of 90 kg.ha(-1) N top-dressing in the phenological stages V-3, V-4, and R-5 of the common bean and a control without fertilization. The evaluated variables were: sieve yield greater than or equal to 12 (SY >= 12), crude protein content, cooking time, and hydration ratio. Crop succession promotes differences in the technological quality of common bean; however, the N splitting fertilization did not change the technological attributes of grains. The highest technological quality of common bean was obtained after succession with U. ruziziensis sole, generating large size and crude protein content of grain, followed by the succession with maize + U. ruziziensis intercropping, and finally, the succession with maize sole. Therefore, the crop succession is a fundamental factor for obtaining common bean with higher technological quality, affecting the food biological value and the profitability of producers."

The incidence of bean flies decreased with increasing plant populations from 66,666 to 533,332 plants per ha. Ovipunctures made by bean flies in the leaves of beans were not significantly different among the various treatments. A significant and gradual decrease in the number of ovipunctures from lower to higher plant populations was recorded. The bean fly larva-pupal counts were significantly lower in both intercrop combinations than in pure stand beans; larval-pupal counts were significantly lower in higher plant populations in 1983 season.

The experimental scheme assumed intercropping of two soybean cultivars alternately with one and two rows of buckwheat. The control (C) was soybean in monoculture. Both Annushka and Mavka cultivars significantly increased seed yield in the intercropping system with one row of buckwheat as compared to control. The addition of two rows of buckwheat resulted in a significant decrease in seed yield of both soybean cultivars compared to control. The seeds of both cultivars had significantly higher fat content and better fatty acid composition in both variants of intercropping with buckwheat compared to soybean monoculture. Significant changes in the amino acid composition were noted in the seeds of Mavka cultivar, in which glutamic and aspartic acids were the most abundant and the cultivation with two rows of buckwheat additionally increased their content. Intercropping of soybean with buckwheat significantly reduced weed infestation in both tested soybean cultivars. The presented results confirm the assumed hypothesis and the most advantageous variant turned out to be the cultivation of soybean with one row of buckwheat.

Soil nutrients balance in sweet orange intercropped with some arable crops	JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION			English	Article						"nutrient balance; cropping system; citrus; arable crops; crop growth and yield"	ORGANIC-MATTER	Sweet orange (Citrus sinensis (L) Osbeck Cv. Agege) was intercropped between 1996 and 1999 on an alfisol (Oxic Paleustalf), at the National Horticultural Research Institute, Ibadan Nigeria. The objectives were to determine the best compatible crops that would provide stable environmental conditions for sweet orange growth and yield. The companion crops were maize (M) (Zea mays L. DMR-LSR-W) in the early planting season, followed by cowpea (CP) (Vigna unguiculata L., Walp cv. Ife-brown) in the late planting season of each year, cassava (CA) (Manihot esculenta, Crantz cv. TMS30572), and pineapple (P) Ananas comosus, cv. Smooth cayenne). For comparison, there were sole plots of sweet orange (SCT), maize (SM), cowpea (SCP), Cassava (SCA), and pineapple (SP) to serve as controls. The treatments were assigned to plots using a randomized complete block design (RCB). The growth of sweet orange intercropped with cassava was not as good as that of sole orange or orange intercropped with maize/cowpea (CT + M/CP) and pineapple (CT + P). Sweet orange in pure stands and CT + M/CP produced flowers 24 months after transplanting, with 75% and 87% of trees producing flowers and fruits, respectively. Forty-two months after transplanting sweet orange, SCT, CT + M/CP, and CT + CA had 1.63, 1.45, and 0.05 citrus fruit t/ha, respectively. Sweet orange intercropped with pineapple did not produce fruits. The effects of the crop mixtures on the soil showed that pH decreased by 2.17, which was a 5.2% decrease for all the cropping systems after three years of continuous cropping. There was a build up of nitrogen (N) and organic carbon in the soil for all the intercrops after the third year of the study. The cropping mixture of CT + M/CP and SCT had the highest N value of 0.70 g N/kg soil as compared to 0.30 g N/kg pre-planting. Zinc (Zn) a major nutrient of citrus, decreased from 3.16 mg/kg to 0.37 mg/kg under SCT and SP cropping systems. Sweet orange leaf analysis for N in all the treatments showed that leaf N was higher than the 2.5 - 2.7% optimum level, except for citrus intercropped with cassava, which had a leaf N concentration of 2.36%. Sweet orange intercropped with maize/cowpea had the highest phosphorus (P) level of 0.17%, followed by SCT, while sweet orange intercropped with cassava or pineapple had the lowest P values. Potassium (K) was in the adequate range in the sweet orange leaves for all the cropping systems, but the Zn content was below the satisfactory range of 20 - 50 ppm. The nutrient dynamics were results of the interaction among cropping systems, soil depth, and cropping cycle. Maize intercropped in the early planting season followed by cowpea in the late season was the most compatible crop with sweet orange in terms of fruit yield.

Treatments were cassava intercropped with Desmanthus virgatus (C + Dv) or Gliricidia sepium (C + Gs), and cassava alone (C) was the control. The harvested biomass was weighed and samples for the determination of dry matter (DM), nitrogen (N), crude protein (CP), and leaf proportion were taken. Soil fertility was assessed by a 'biological test' with maize grown in soil samples from the cassava plots and sod samples were also analyzed for the determination of chemical composition at the beginning and the end of the experiment. Intercropping did not affect cassava DM and CP yields but total DM and CP yields were increased by 43% and 39% in D. virgatus and G. sepium intercrops, respectively. Intercropping increased leaf proportion in the cassava DM. The total CP yield ranged from 0.1 to 0.5, from 0.4 to 0.6 and from 0.3 to 0.6 tons harvest occasion(-1) in treatments C, C + Dv, and C + Gs, respectively. The CP content ranged from 21.1-29.3% and 8.3-10.8% in the cassava leaf and stems plus petioles, respectively, while the CP contents in D. virgatus and G. sepium were 14.8% and 15.6%, respectively. It was estimated that D. virgatus and G. sepium fixed 1/3 and 1/2 of the N amounts removed in the cassava forage, respectively. In this experiment all biomass produced was removed from the plots and soil fertility declined.

Annual crop rotation of tropical pastures with no-till soil as affected by lime surface application	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"Acidity; Soil management; Plant nutrition; Net profit; Sustainability of tropical agriculture"	"DIFFERENT GRAZING INTENSITIES; LIVESTOCK SYSTEM; SOYBEAN YIELD; CHEMICAL-PROPERTIES; GRAIN PRODUCTION; USE EFFICIENCY; COVER CROPS; ROOT-GROWTH; ACID SOILS; CORN"	Soil acidity and low natural fertility are the main limiting factors for grain production in tropical regions such as the Brazilian Cerrado. The application of lime to the surface of no-till soil can improve plant nutrition, dry matter production, crop yields and revenue. The present study, conducted at the Lageado Experimental Farm in Botucatu, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, is part of an ongoing research project initiated in 2002 to evaluate the long-term effects of the surface application of lime on the soil's chemical attributes, nutrition and kernel/grain yield of peanut (Arachis hypogaea), white oat (Avena sativa L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) intercropped with palisade grass (Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu), as well as the forage dry matter yield of palisade grass in winter/spring, its crude protein concentration, estimated meat production, and revenue in a tropical region with a dry winter during four growing seasons. The experiment was designed in randomized blocks with four replications. The treatments consisted of four rates of lime application (0, 1000, 2000 and 4000 kg ha(-1)), performed in November 2004. The surface application of limestone to the studied tropical no-till soil was efficient in reducing soil acidity from the surface down to a depth of 0.60m and resulted in greater availability of P and K at the soil surface. Ca and Mg availability in the soil also increased with the lime application rate, up to a depth of 0.60 m. Nutrient absorption was enhanced with liming, especially regarding the nutrient uptake of K, Ca and Mg by plants. Significant increases in the yield components and kernel/grain yields of peanut, white oat and maize were obtained through the surface application of limestone. The lime rates estimated to achieve the maximum grain yield, especially in white oat and maize, were very close to the rates necessary to increase the base saturation of a soil sample collected at a depth of 0-0.20 m to 70%, indicating that the surface liming of 2000 kg ha-1 is effective for the studied tropical no-till soil. This lime rate also increases the forage dry matter yield, crude protein concentration and estimated meat production during winter/spring in the maize-palisade grass intercropping, provides the highest total and mean net profit during the four growing seasons, and can improve the long-term sustainability of tropical agriculture in the Brazilian Cerrado.

The pooled average per cent fruit infestation by fruit borer was lowest in the marigold intercrop treatment (9.69) followed by coriander intercropping (12.40) on weight basis. While the sole crop (32.14) recorded the highest per cent fruit infestation. The treatments having maize as border crop and coriander/ marigold/ mint as intercrop recorded the highest population of natural enemies.

However, soil conditions and crop selection are key determining factors for soil microbial communities. This study investigated the effect of plant types and soil salinity on the microbial community of interspecific interaction zone (II) based on the sorghum/peanut intercropping system. Microbial community diversity and composition were determined through PacBio single molecule, real-time sequencing of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) genes. Results showed Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota, and Acidobacteriota to be the dominant bacterial phyla in IP, II, and IS, whereas Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Mucoromycota were the dominant fungal phyla. Under salt-treated soil conditions, the plants-specific response altered the composition of the microbial community (diversity and abundance). Additionally, the interspecific interactions were also helpful for maintaining the stability and ecological functions of microbial communities by restructuring the otherwise stable core microbiome. The phylogenetic structure of the bacterial community was greatly similar between IP and II while that of the fungal community was greatly similar between IP and IS; however, the phylogenetic distance between IP and IS increased remarkably upon salinity stress. Overall, salinity was a dominant factor shaping the microbial community structure, although plants could also shape the rhizosphere microenvironment by host specificity when subjected to environmental stresses. In particular, peanut still exerted a greater influence on the microbial community of the interaction zone than sorghum."

Therefore, a nondestructive estimation of soybean leaf carbon content (LCC) and leaf nitrogen content (LNC) is important for managing soybean production. This study aims to investigate the properties of soybean LCC, LNC and leaf carbon and nitrogen ratio (LCNR) under different light conditions and to construct the estimation models for soybean LCC, LNC and LCNR on the basis of hyperspectral reflectance. A 3-year field trial was conducted from 2013 to 2015 to investigate the effect of five shade treatments (from 57% to 18% of normal photosynthetic active radiation) by regulating the distance between maize and soybean rows in an intercropping system. Results showed that the LNC is increased, and the LCC is decreased with the increase in shading level. A typical leaf hyperspectral reflectance showed that the changes in near infrared and around the green peak are approximately proportional to the LCC and analogously inverse to the LNC. The corresponding first-order derivative presented the changes in the red-edge positions as a 'blue shift' with the increase in shading level. General vegetation indices (VIs), uninformative variable elimination-partial least squares (UVE-PLS) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) were used to develop the models. The linear models constructed using the CWT, compared with the VIs and LTVE-PLS, had the highest determination coefficient and the lowest root mean square error (RMSE). The models were validated using independent data from 2015 with RMSE values of 1.9789, 0.6132 and 2.1587 for the LCC, LNC and LCNR, respectively. Moreover, these models obtained relative errors of 4.5%, 13.2% and 20% for the LCC, LNC and LCNR, respectively. Results indicated that soybean LNC and LCC can be accurately estimated using the CWT for assessing the physiological situation.

To test whether this is an economic proposition, Arabica and Robusta coffee was intercropped with various food crops at several sites in the main coffee-growing zones of Kenya. Intercropping with potatoes, tomatoes, dry beans, cabbages, carrots and soyabeans was found to be economically viable, depending on the site, Intercropping coffee with maize, sweet potatoes, groundnuts, cowpeas, garden peas and cassava was not economic, however.

Poir.] to increase forage yield and quality. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of two barley and two oat cultivars and seeding rates of cereal-pea intercrop on forage production, crude protein (CP) concentration, and N yield. A field experiment was conducted in 1993 and 1994 under dryland management in both fallowed and continuously cropped, no tillage environments. 'Bowman' and 'Horsford' barley, and 'Dumont' and 'Magnum' oat, were each sown at 93, 185, and 278 kernels m(-2) with 'Trapper' pea at 40, 80, and 120 seeds m(-2), in all possible rate combinations. The cereal cultivars also mere sown alone at 185 kernels m(-2). Cultivars developed for forage production (Horsford, Magnum) produced as much or more forage than cultivars developed for grain production (Bowman, Dumont) across sole-crop and intercrop plots (P less than or equal to 0.05). Forage yield was unaffected by intercropping when the cereal crop was sown at the sole-crop or greater rate. Less forage was produced by intercrops when the cereal component was sown at half the sole-crop rate. Forage yield was not affected by the pea seeding rate, but CP concentration increased with increasing seeding rate of pea in three of four environment-years. Forage N yield was unaffected by intercropping. These data indicate that the cereal component in barley-pea and oat-pea mixtures should be sown at a sole-crop or greater seeding rate for maximum forage production. Forage CP concentration can be increased as the relative proportion of pea seed to cereal kernels sown in a mixture is increased, but forage N yield may not be affected, since the cereal component contributes more to yield than the pea component.

Agronomic measures have to lie optimized to control disease and minimize yield and quality loss, because no fungicides call be applied. Resistant sugar beet cultivars have been introduced to reduce disease occurrence. Furthermore. crop rotation can influence R. solani occurrence. In contrast to other cereals, maize serves as a host of the fungus. In order to study the combined effect of these factors, a series of four field trial,. was established with crop rotations varying in the proportion of maize and comparing a resistant with a susceptible sugar beet cultivar in 2001-02 in southern Germany. Within crop rotations, cultivation methods were varied in the form of soil tillage, intercrops, or both. Sugar beet cultivar and crop rotation had the main impact oil disease severity and sugar yield. With increasing proportion of maize, sugar yield decreased, whereas cultivation method had only a minor impact. Plowing directly before sugar beet increased sugar yield only within the unfavorable maize-maize-sugar beet rotation compared with mulching. These results Five strong evidence that crop rotation of sugar beet with nonhost plants and cultivation of resistant sugar beet cultivars are adequate means for integrated R. solani control.

This study aimed to determine the N accumulation and export by common bean as a function of Zea mays and Urochloa ruziziensis grass straw (maize, maize/U. ruziziensis intercropping and U. ruziziensis) and splitting of top-dressing N fertilization. The experiment was conducted in Jaboticabal-SP-Brazil, during the 2012/13 crop season, in a Red Eutrophic Oxisol (Eutrudox) in no-tillage under irrigation. The experimental design was a randomized block with split plots with four replicates, totaling 120 subplots sized in 25m(2) each. The plots consisted of the cropping systems prior to common bean: maize, maize/U. ruziziensis intercropping and U. ruziziensis. The subplots were composed of ten top-dressing N fertilization splitting schemes (NS) at the phenological stages V3, V4 and R5 in different combinations. Common bean grain yield differs among cropping systems and as a function of top-dressed N split application. U. ruziziensis grass as single crop promotes greater N accumulation in common bean shoots compared to maize and its intercropping with U. ruziziensis grass. Regardless the cropping system, top-dressing N application in a single dose (90 kg ha(-1)) at V-4 leads to similar accumulations and exports to those found in the absence of N fertilization. Splitting schemes with N application at the R-5 stage increase the exports of this nutrient by common bean in succession to maize and its intercropping with U. ruziziensis grass.

First, we estimate the determinants of adoption by applying a multivariate panel data model capturing their complementarities and/or substitutabilities. Second, after testing for their potential endogeneity, we study the impact of these practices (and combinations of them) on maize productivity controlling for weather shocks. Finally, we disaggregate results by presence/absence of seasonal rainfall and temperature shocks to explore the heterogeneous impact of adoption under weather shocks. We find strong complementarities between agricultural practices both in terms of adoption and yield impacts. Long-run variability in rainfall decreases the adoption of organic fertilizers and increases that of improved seeds. Farmers in areas where the cropping season's rainfall has been highly variable and temperature has been unexpectedly high have significantly lower maize yields. SWC emerges as one of the most important practices in increasing yields with significant benefits by itself, in combination with other practices, under average weather conditions as well as under rainfall and temperature shocks. Overall, increasing the adoption of SWC appears a promising policy option to buffer food security from increasingly frequent weather shocks in Tanzania. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

L.), a perennial grain which has potential as a human or animal foodstuff. The potential to manage these diseases through intercropping eastern gamagrass with other, non-host perennial species was examined by monitoring incidence and severity on eastern gamagrass within experimental monocultures, two-species mixtures with wildrye (Leymus racemosus (Lam.) Tsvelev), two-species mixtures with Illinois bundleflower (Desmanthus illinoensis (Michx.) MacM., Leguminosae), and three-species mixtures with wildrye and Illinois bundleflower at two sites in Kansas, USA, from 1991 to 1995, Wildrye and bundleflower, which are also potential grain crops, are not reported to be hosts of the viruses. At Site 1, in 1991 and 1992, disease was generally less frequent and less severe in biculture with bundleflower and in the three-species mixture than in monoculture or the biculture with wildrye. No treatment effects were observed at Site 2. Disease severity was negatively correlated with plant size and seed yield at Site 1. Seed yield per plant was generally higher in polyculture than in monoculture. The results suggest polyculture may contribute to the management of aphid-borne plant disease within plantings of perennial grains.

The aim was to use white lupin (Lupinus albus L) and Andean lupin (L mutabilis Sweet) as supporting crops, and intercrop them with nine other annual cool season legumes, as supported crops. The highest two-year average total forage dry matter yield obtained was for the intercrop of white lupin with grass pea (11.2 t ha(-1)). Intercropping white lupin with Ethiopian pea and French vetch had the highest two-year average values for land equivalent ratio (LER), given as LERFDMY (both 1.20). The highest two-year average total forage dry matter yield came from the intercrop of Andean lupin with grass pea (9.8 t ha(-1)). Intercropping Andean lupin with grass pea had the highest two-year average values of LERFDMY (1.10). The overall average obtained for intercropping white lupin with other cool season annual legumes was 10.3 t ha(-1) of forage dry matter yield and LERFDMY of 1.15, while intercropping white lupin with other cool season annual legumes yielded 8.7 t ha(-1) of forage dry matter and LERFDMY of 1.04. In comparison to the traditional approach of intercropping annual legumes with cereals for forage production, the mutual intercropping of annual legumes provides farmers with higher quality forage and grain richer in protein and better utilisation of natural resources.

Pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) an important food legume in Indian scenario - A review	LEGUME RESEARCH			English	Review						"Cultivation; Intercropping; Medicinal use; Pigeonpea; Trade"	"BREAST-CANCER; LUNG INJURY; L.; DIVERSIFICATION; DIVERSITY; GENISTEIN; EXTRACTS; GROWTH"	According to Indian Institute of Pulses Research Vision document, India's population is expected to touch 1.68 billion by 2030 and the pulse requirement for the year 2030 is projected at 32 million tonnes with anticipated required annual growth rate of 4.2%. Pigeon pea is an important legume crop cultivated across several countries throughout the tropics and subtropics. They are cultivated in India, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Caribbean, East and West Africa. Commonly known as 'Arhar' in Northern India, this protein rich pulse crop has growing demand in Asia. Among the pulses pigeon pea is the second most important kharif grain legume after chickpea in India and grown predominantly under rainfed conditions. The kernels are nutritionally rich containing 20-22% protein. Its cultivation would be able to provide 40-60 kg N/ha to the subsequently grown crop. The leaves and immature stems can be used as a green manure. Fallen leaves can also be used as mulch and thus help to enhance the water holding capacity of soil. Its beneficial effect as an intercrop has also been reported. Sometimes ground dry peas are mixed with wheat flour just to improve the flour quality and its protein content. Additionally, pigeon pea shares a vital part in India's pulse import and export. Keeping all these in view the present review depicts the various aspects of pigeon pea cultivation and its status in Indian trade on pulse.

Merr.] to silage in succession. Thus, during three growing seasons on a Typic Haplorthox in Botucatu, Sao Paulo State, Brazil, four treatments of a corn to silage production system were implemented in summer/autumn with black oat oversown in winter/spring: (1) corn intercropped with palisade grass (Urochloa brizantha Marandu) and black oat overseeded in lines; (2) corn intercropped with palisade grass and black oat overseeded in a broadcast system with superficial incorporation; (3) corn intercropped with palisade grass + pigeon pea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] and black oat overseeded in lines; and (4) corn intercropped with palisade grass + pigeon pea and black oat overseeded in a broadcast system with superficial incorporation. During winter/spring, the black oat pastures were grazed by lambs, but results on forage allowance and nutritive value for animal grazing and on animal performance are not reported in the present manuscript. In the fourth growing season, the effect of soybean to silage intercropped with guinea grass (Panicum maximum Aruana), with only a residual effect of the four production systems from the previous three growing seasons, was evaluated. Despite greater interspecific competition of palisade grass and pigeon pea intercropped with corn, this more complex system produced better results. Thus, when analyzing this system as a whole, the triple intercrop (corn + pigeon pea + palisade grass) combined with oversown black oat in lines was the most effective option for silage production and for the improvement of other elements of system productivity, such higher surface mulch quantity, leaf nutrient concentrations, and yield of soybean to silage intercropped with guinea grass. This intercrop also generated better nutrient cycling because an increased quantity of nutrients was retained in standing plant residue and surface mulch, which resulted in better land- and nutrient-use efficiency, with an emphasis on nitrogen and potassium."

J	MATI, BM				MATI, BM			THE EFFECT OF RAINFALL CHARACTERISTICS ON SPLASH EROSION UNDER CROP COVERS	TROPICAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article						"RAINFALL EROSIVITY; SOIL SPLASH; CROP COVER; HEIGHT"	"DETACHMENT; TRANSPORT"	Rainfall characteristics and splash erosion were assessed on a 25% slope having different crop covers by colleting splashed soil particles using splash traps. This was done on 16 plots containing four treatments of maize, beans, intercropped maize and beans, and bare fallow (control), each replicated four times. Rainfall records, crop over, and height measurements were also taken during the experimental period. Rainfall amount, energy, El-index (product of rainfall energy and its intensity), and Al-index (product of rainfall amount and its intensity) were found to be highly correlated with splash detachment. However, the most highly correlated erosivity index in the area was the AI-index. Both the total splash and the splash from unit area of exposed soil increased nonlinearly with each of the rainfall erosivity indices. For a given value of rainfall erosivity, total splash decreased with an increase in crop cover, in all treatments. For a given erosivity value, splash per unit of exposed land surface was higher from maize plots than from beans, intercropped maize and beans, and the bare fallow plots, which were not different from each other.

Neoplasm formation, a non-meristematic tissue growth on young field pea (Pisum sativum L.) pods is triggered in the absence of UV light and/or in response to oviposition by pea weevil (Bruchus pisorum L.). This trait is expressed in some genotypes [neoplastic (Np) genotypes] of P. sativum and has the capacity to obstruct pea weevil larval entry into developing seeds. In the present study, 26% of the tested accessions depicted the trait when grown under greenhouse conditions. However, UV light inhibits full expression of this trait and subsequently it is inconspicuous at the field level. In order to investigate UV light impact on the expression of neoplasm, particular Np genotypes were subjected to UV lamp light exposure in the greenhouse and sunlight at the field level. Under these different growing conditions, the highest mean percentage of No pods was in the control chamber in the greenhouse (36%) whereas in single and double UV lamp chambers, the percentage dropped to 10 and 15%, respectively. Furthermore, when the same Np genotypes were grown in the field, the percentage of Np pods dropped significantly (7%). In order to enhance Np expression at the field level, intercropping of Np genotypes with sorghum was investigated. As result, the percentage of Np pods was threefold in intercropped Np genotypes as compared to those without intercropping. Therefore, intercropping Np genotypes with other crops such as sorghum and maize can facilitate neoplasm formation, which in turn can minimize the success rate of pea weevil larvae entry into developing seeds. Greenhouse artificial infestation experiments showed that pea weevil damage in Np genotypes is lower in comparison to wild type genotypes. Therefore, promoting Np formation under field conditions via intercropping can serve as part of an integrated pea weevil management strategy especially for small scale farming systems.

IACA/RACA improves the yield of the crop per unit area, but rather decreases the yield of a single crop compared with mono-cropping agricultural cultivation approach. In peanut IACA/RACA, peanut plants would grow under low light and high light pulses (HLP) before maize/wheat harvest. Energy dissipation in photosystem 2 (PS2) complexes was evaluated in peanut leaves after being induced by light pulses and continuous light with different light intensities. Actual photochemical efficiency of PS2 (I broken vertical bar PS2) and non-photochemical quenching induced by light pulses in peanut leaves generally were significantly lower compared with those induced by continuous light. In addition, the degree of PS2 reaction center closure (1-qP) induced by light pulses in peanut leaves was significantly higher compared with those induced by continuous light. Different results were obtained only for I broken vertical bar PS2 and 1-qP induced by 20 s HLP. In methyl viologen (MV) treated samples, I broken vertical bar PS2 and the quantum yield of light induced thermal dissipation by non-functional PS2 (I broken vertical bar(NF)) were similar to those observed in non-MV treatments. These results implied that light pulses could induce photoinactivation of PS2 reaction centers but not the xanthophyll cycle to dissipate excess energy.

The objective of this study was to apply intercropping principles to alternative and traditional crops in the USA under mechanized conditions, Although these crops hare been examined in intercropping systems, in most cases studies were not conducted with improved varieties found in the USA or in strip widths that can accommodate machinery. A field study was conducted at two central Missouri locations in 1991 and 1992 to determine the effect of intercropping on grain yields of pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.], amaranth (Amaranthus hypochondriacus L. x A, hybridus L.), cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.], guar [Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taub.], and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill], Treatments were assigned in an incomplete factorial design and consisted of planting pattern (monocrops, narrow and wide row strips, and alternate row intercrops), N fertilizer (0, 56, or 112 kg N ha(-1)), and component crop combination. Each intercrop consisted of a legume (cowpea, soybean, or guar) and a nonlegume (pearl millet or amaranth). In the strip intercrops, only cowpea showed a consistent yield response to planting pattern, with the narrow strip arrangement with amaranth yielding 53 and 39% lower than its monocrop in two environments. Land equivalent ratios of amaranth and pearl millet groan in alternate rows with cowpea were not significantly different from their monocrops. At the Columbia site, yields of alternate row intercrops generally did not increase upon addition of N and in 1992, amaranth yield at 0 kg N ha(-1) was 25% higher in the alternate row intercrop than it was at the same N rate in the monocrop. In general, grain yields were similar in the various intercrops compared with monocrops.

Yields and qualities of pigeonpea varieties grown under smallholder farmers' conditions in Eastern and Southern Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						"Cajanus cajan; genotypic variation; ICRISAT East African pigeonpea (ICEAP); nutrient deficiencies; pigeonpea"	"PHOSPHORUS UPTAKE; CROPPING SYSTEMS; SOIL FERTILITY; MAIZE YIELDS; MALAWI"	"Pigeonpea is one of the few crops with a high potential for resource-poor farmers due to its complementary resource use when intercropped with maize. A three year comprehensive comparative study on the performance of six pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) varieties on farmers' fields in Eastern and Southern Africa where intercropping with maize is normal practice, was undertaken. The varieties were tested for accumulation of dry matter (DM), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in all above-ground organs for three years under farmers' conditions. The study revealed that the latest introduced ICEAP 00040 outperformed all the other tested varieties (ICP 9145; ICEAP 00020, ICEAP 00053, ICEAP 00068, and a local variety called Babati White) under farmer-managed conditions. The harvest indices (HI), ranging from 0.08-0.15 on dry matter (DM) basis, were relatively low and unaffected (P> 0.05) by the environmental variation. The N harvest index (NHI) was 0.28 and P harvest index (PHI) was 0.19. The better responses of ICEAP 00040 to favourable conditions could however only be realised in a minority of cases as yields generally were low. These low yields are still a major challenge in African smallholder agriculture as pulses play an important role in soil fertility maintenance as well as in the household diets."

Three ratios of substitutive oat-pea intercrops were tested on a fertile soil in eastern Austria with application of a low nitrogen (N) fertiliser rate (6 g N m(-2)) versus an unfertilised control to assess the effect of intercropping and low N fertilisation on dinitrogen fixation (N-FIX). The above-ground dry matter (AGDM) and N yield of intercrops increased with N fertilisation, but the increase occurred only in oat, while pea was not affected by N fertilisation. Pure pea stands and intercrops with high pea share resulted in N sparing in the soil at harvest, as the soil mineral N was higher than in pure oat. Half of the applied amount of N was recovered by the AGDM of crops and half remained in the soil at harvest. The N-FIX per unit area was highest in pure pea. Intercropping considerably reduced N-FIX, especially in intercrops with low pea share. N-FIX per unit of AGDM of pea, however, was neither affected by intercropping nor by N fertilisation. Consequently, a low amount of N fertilisation of oat-pea intercrops on a fertile soil can increase overall performance of the system through increasing the performance of oat without impairing that of pea.

Yet, the effect of this practice on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions remains poorly understood. In this context, a field experiment was carried out under Mediterranean conditions to evaluate the effect of replacing the traditional winter fallow (F) by vetch (Vicia sativa L.; V) or barley (Hordeum vulgare L.; B) on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during the intercrop and the maize (Zea mays L.) cropping period. The maize was fertilized following integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) criteria. Maize nitrogen (N) uptake, soil mineral N concentrations, soil temperature and moisture, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and GHG fluxes were measured during the experiment. Our management (adjusted N synthetic rates due to ISFM) and pedo-climatic conditions resulted in low cumulative N2O emissions (0.57 to 0.75 kgN(2)O-N ha(-1) yr(-1)) , yield-scaled N2O emissions (36 gN(2)O-N kg aboveground N uptake(-1)) and N surplus (31 to 56 kg N ha(-1)) for all treatments. Although CCs increased N2O emissions during the intercrop period compared to F (1.6 and 2.6 times in B and V, respectively), the ISFM resulted in similar cumulative emissions for the CCs and F at the end of the maize cropping period. The higher C : N ratio of the B residue led to a greater proportion of N2O losses from the synthetic fertilizer in these plots when compared to V. No significant differences were observed in CH4 and CO2 fluxes at the end of the experiment. This study shows that the use of both legume and nonlegume CCs combined with ISFM could provide, in addition to the advantages reported in previous studies, an opportunity to maximize agronomic efficiency (lowering synthetic N requirements for the subsequent cash crop) without increasing cumulative or yield-scaled N2O losses."

Whether a change in cropping systems can be used as an effective adaptation strategy against drought is still unclear. We investigated how plant water uptake patterns of a field-grown pea-barley (Pisum sativum L. and Hordeum vulgare L.) mixture, an important fodder intercrop, responded to experimental drought under four cropping systems, i.e. organic intensive tillage, conventional intensive tillage, conventional no tillage, and organic reduced tillage. Drought was simulated after crop establishment using rain shelters. Proportional contributions to plant water uptake from different soil layers were estimated based on stable water isotopes using Bayesian mixing models. Pea plants always took up proportionally more water from shallower depths than barley plants. Water uptake patterns of neither species were affected by cropping systems. Both species showed similar responses to the drought simulation and increased their proportional water uptake from the shallow soil layer (0-20 cm) in all cropping systems. Our results highlight the impact of drought on plant water uptake patterns for two important crop species and suggest that cropping systems might not be as successful as adaptation strategies against drought as previously thought.

The objective of this research was to develop adapted dwarf bean populations having a commercial seed quality and yield suitable for the production in the South of Europe. The original base populations were produced from crosses between genotypes within each Mesoamerica, Nueva Granada and Peru races, and between Peru and Nueva Granada, and Mesoamerica and Nueva Granada races. Visual mass selection for plant performance was practised in the F-2 and F-3 generations. In the F-4 and F-5, single plants were harvested under two cropping systems (sole cropping and intercropping with maize). From F-4, selection was based on precocity, combined with seed yield and seed commercial type. The F-4:7 selected lines from each original population were compared with their parents and five checks at four environments and two cropping systems. Differences among environments, populations, parents and checks were observed for all traits. Under intercropping with maize, there was a 50% reduction in seed yield. Yield of parents and checks belonging to Andean South American races, intraracial (Nueva Granada x Nueva Granada) and interracial (Nueva Granada x Peru) populations, was higher than that of those of Middle American origin. Intraracial crosses within large-seeded Andean South American (Peru race) and Middle American gene pools (Mesoamerica race) did not produce lines yielding more than the highest yielding parent. Only two large-seeded lines selected from crosses between small- and large-seeded gene pools out-yielded the best parent and check cultivar.

We develop a dynamic household bio-economic model by taking into account the existing farming system, resource constraints and market imperfections. Climate-induced production risk is introduced into the model by estimating a weather-specific production function using data generated from a crop simulation model. It is found that the full package of CA, which consists of minimum tillage, mulching and crop diversification, does not appear to be in the best interest of smallholder farmers. However, loosely defined CA practises such as sole maize production with conservation tillage and maize-bean intercropping with conventional tillage, which are not currently practised in the study area, are likely to be adopted by the farmers. The results further demonstrate that time preference, risk aversion, limited credit and market access are key constraints to CA uptake. However, merely addressing these constraints may be insufficient incentives for smallholder farmers to fully adopt CA practises. It is important to identify conditions under which the full package CA can be effectively adopted before it is widely promoted. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Reticulated Origin of Domesticated Emmer Wheat Supports a Dynamic Model for the Emergence of Agriculture in the Fertile Crescent	PLOS ONE			English	Article							"RNA MULTIGENE FAMILY; TRITICUM-DICOCCOIDES; PHYLOGENETIC NETWORKS; TETRAPLOID WHEATS; AFLP ANALYSIS; COMMON WHEAT; WILD WHEATS; NEAR-EAST; GENE FLOW; EVOLUTION"	We used supernetworks with datasets of nuclear gene sequences and novel markers detecting retrotransposon insertions in ribosomal DNA loci to reassess the evolutionary relationships among tetraploid wheats. We show that domesticated emmer has a reticulated genetic ancestry, sharing phylogenetic signals with wild populations from all parts of the wild range. The extent of the genetic reticulation cannot be explained by post-domestication gene flow between cultivated emmer and wild plants, and the phylogenetic relationships among tetraploid wheats are incompatible with simple linear descent of the domesticates from a single wild population. A more parsimonious explanation of the data is that domesticated emmer originates from a hybridized population of different wild lineages. The observed diversity and reticulation patterns indicate that wild emmer evolved in the southern Levant, and that the wild emmer populations in south-eastern Turkey and the Zagros Mountains are relatively recent reticulate descendants of a subset of the Levantine wild populations. Based on our results we propose a new model for the emergence of domesticated emmer. During a pre-domestication period, diverse wild populations were collected from a large area west of the Euphrates and cultivated in mixed stands. Within these cultivated stands, hybridization gave rise to lineages displaying reticulated genealogical relationships with their ancestral populations. Gradual movement of early farmers out of the Levant introduced the pre-domesticated reticulated lineages to the northern and eastern parts of the Fertile Crescent, giving rise to the local wild populations but also facilitating fixation of domestication traits.

JOURNAL OF ELEMENTOLOGY			English	Article						"undersown crop; competition; water deficit; nitrogen content; nitrogen uptake"	"DRY-MATTER; REMOBILIZATION; FERTILIZATION; COMPETITION; CULTIVAR; DEFICIT; PLANTS; WHEAT; YIELD; SOIL"	Competitive interactions are common in plant communities, but the underlying mechanisms and effects of competition have not been fully elucidated to date. A pot experiment (3 series in 20092011) was conducted to evaluate the effect of a sowing-method of spring barley and Italian ryegrass, and different water condition on the nitrogen (N) content and accumulation in the aerial biomass of plants at different stages. The experimental factors were as :follows: 1) sowing regime pure sowing and mixed sowing spring barley undersown with Italian ryegrass, 2) water supply plants supplied with water to meet their full requirements and 50% water supply reduction. The N content of the aerial biomass of plants was determined at five phonological development stages of spring barley grown in a pure stand under optimal soil moisture conditions: leaf development, tillering, stem elongation, heading and ripening. Nitrogen uptake was determined based on the N content and dry matter accumulation in plants. Nitrogen concentrations in the aerial biomass of barley and ryegrass varied throughout the growing season. Nitrogen content was particularly high in leaves, and it decreased steadily during plant development. Neither the sowing regime nor the water supply exerted significant effects on the N content of the aerial biomass of spring barley. In Italian ryegrass, under optimal water supply, mixed so a wing with spring barley decreased N concentrations in shoots only during tillering. In spring barley, mixed sowing reduced N uptake by biomass, and the observed decrease was exacerbated under water deficit. In Italian ryegrass, reduced water supply decreased N uptake, but the effect of competitive interactions between the analyzed species was usually stronger than the influence of water deficit. Differences in N accumulation in aerial biomass were determined by the amount of biomass produced in mixed stands and the responses of barley and regrass to water deficit.

Seasonal patterns in post-dispersal seed predation of Abutilon theophrasti and Setaria faberi in three cropping systems	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						"crop phenology; crop rotation; ecological weed management; habitat quality; vegetative cover; weed seed predation"	"REFUGE HABITATS; SMALL MAMMALS; WEED SEEDS; CARABIDAE; COLEOPTERA; COVER; TILLAGE; POPULATIONS; DEMOGRAPHY; DENSITY"	1. Post-dispersal seed predation is an important source of mortality for arable weed populations that can potentially contribute to ecologically based management strategies. The extent to which cropping practices influence rates of seed predation is not well established. 2. Removal of Abutilon theophrasti and Setaria faberi seeds by predators was measured in 2-year (maize/soyabean), 3-year (maize/soyabean/triticale + red clover) and 4-year (maize/soyabean/triticale + lucerne/lucerne) crop rotations in Iowa, USA, during 27 48-h sampling periods conducted during the 2003 and 2004 cropping seasons. 3. Predation of S. faberi seeds was equal (eight sampling periods) or greater (19 sampling periods) than predation of A. theophrasti seeds, but the influence of crops on seasonal predation patterns was generally similar for the two weeds. 4. Seasonal patterns in seed predation were crop-specific and complementary. In maize and soyabean, seed predation was low in spring, high in summer and low in autumn. In triticale-legume intercrops, seed predation was high in spring, low in summer and moderate in autumn. In lucerne, seed predation fluctuated from high to low, matching the periodic harvest and regrowth cycle of the crop. 5. Measurements of crop canopy light interception taken in 2004 were positively correlated with rates of seed removal for both A. theophrasti (r = 0.54, P < 0.001) and S. faberi (r = 0.25, P < 0.001), suggesting that vegetative cover promotes weed seed predation. 6. Synthesis and applications. The results indicate that crop vegetation can be managed to promote weed seed predation. Diversified farming systems that include a range of phenologically dissimilar crop species are likely to provide the greatest opportunities for weed seed destruction by predators.

The mixed seeded crop was harvested at late stem elongation (LSE), early booting (EB) and early heading (EH) stage of oat. First cut mixture herbage dry matter (DM) yield was lower than oat monoculture. Berseem substantially recovered from suppression by oat prior to first cut. After two cuts, mixtures herbage DM and crude protein (CP) yields were higher when first cut was taken at EH stage. On an average, first cut CP concentrations in mixtures were 11.25 g kg(-1) DM which was significantly higher as compared to oat monoculture. After two cuts, mixture with 25% oat ratio produced 6% higher CP yield than sole berseem. Fiber concentrations in mixtures were lower than sole oat in first cut while higher than sole berseem in re-growth cut. Thus mixing of oat seeding ratio as low as 25% combined with harvesting at EH cutting stage was proved to be more productive in terms of forage yield and quality.

Optimal NH4+/NO3- ratios enhance the shade tolerance of soybean seedlings under low light conditions	PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						"biomass; low light; NH4+/NO3-; normal light; photosynthesis"		"In the maize-soybean intercropping system, shade is the major chronic restraint that affects normal growth of soybean. Different spatial patterns of this system affect the microclimate of soybean through shading from maize plants. However, the negative impacts of shading stress can be mitigated by providing optimal ratios of different fertilizers. Therefore, to test this hypothesis, soybean plants were grown under different light conditions (normal light or shade) to evaluate the response to varying NH4+/NO3- ratios. Seeds of soybean (Glycine max L. cv. Nan-99-6) were grown in nutrient solution with a total concentration of 5 mM N using different NH4+/NO3- ratios (T-0 = 0:0, T-1 = 0:100, T-2 = 25:75, T-3 = 50:50 and T-4 = 75:25) for 40 days in a greenhouse at PPFD 320.95 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (low light) or 967.53 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (normal light). Under low light, growth and photosynthesis of soybean seedlings significantly decreased as compared to normal light conditions. However, the optimal ratios of NH4+/ NO3- improved growth and photosynthesis of soybean seedlings under both light conditions. Our results indicated that soybean seedlings supplied with optimal NH4+/NO3- ratios (25:75 and 50:50) have maximum biomass yield, chlorophyll pigments, leaf gas exchange, photochemical activity and root growth as compared to low and high NH4+/NO3- ratios (T-1 and T-4). High ratios of NH4+/NO3- (T-4) resulted in reduced plant growth due to nutrient accumulation in plant tissues; therefore, we suggest that optimal ratios of NH4+/NO3- (T-2 and T-3) can enhance the shade tolerance of soybean seedlings."

Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine evapotranspiration under standard conditions (ETc), reference evapotranspiration (ETo), and the crop coefficient (K-c) of coffee plants interplanted between maize (Zea mays L.) (coffee-maize) for the first 12 mo of growth and coffee grown without maize from 13 to 46 m after transplanting (MAT). In this study, ETc was measured using the eddy covariance method. The ETc of coffee-maize ranged from 4.17 to 4.71 mm d(-1), while ETc of coffee-sun averaged 4.32 +/- 0.07 mm d(-1) between 13 and 24 MAT and 4.09 +/- 0.03 mm d(-1) between 25 and 43 MAT for coffee trees in the reproductive stage. The K-c was 0.87 for coffee plants between 0 and 12 MAT, 0.98 +/- 0.01 between 13 and 24 MAT, and 0.97 +/- 0.02 between 25 and 43 MAT. Maize intercropped between coffee trees produced an adapted microclimate for the first 2 mo, allowing energy used for evapotranspiration processes (latent heat flux) to be greater than energy used for air warming (sensible heat flux), although there was low soil water availability. K-c values are a foundation for optimizing coffee crop water use under climate and soil conditions for the intertropical Andean hillside region.

Yet, after more than a decade of experimental research, the long-term potential of this system remains uncertain. The approach used to address this question has been to use the APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator) model in conjunction with historical climate records to simulate system performance. Thus, the objectives of this paper were to describe APSIM, to test its performance against data from cropping systems experiments, and to use it in assessing the long-term consequences of alternative farming practice in this region of northern Australia. APSIM is able to simulate the soil carbon, water and nitrogen balances arising from interactions between different crops and pastures grown in rotation. In this paper, APSIM was configured to simulate either conventional rotations of sorghum or maize crops, or crops grown in rotation with Stylosanthes hamata (Verano) ley pastures. In the latter case, APSIM simulates the establishment of a Verano pasture sward, its growth and death, and its effects on subsequent cereal crops. The crop is either kept free of weeds or, alternatively, an understorey of volunteer legume can establish to form an intercrop where the crop and pasture compete for resources. Simulation of crop and pasture residues can encompass either their retention on the soil surface and decomposition over time, or their complete removal from the system (as hay). In comparisons of simulations against limited experimental data, APSIM was able to reproduce the measured yields from sorghum, maize and Verano grown either as sole crops, as intercrops, or in rotations of several years. Likewise, a simulation analysis using APSIM of several cropping options for Katherine, Northern Territory, resulted in the preferred outcome reflecting current farming practices in the region. This preferred option, a combination of legume hay and sorghum grain production, was shown to be superior in terms of both gross margin returns and long-term soil fertility status. It was concluded that APSIM now provides a useful tool with which farming systems in northern Australia can be further explored.

This study aims to explore a three-dimensional planting mode in orchards and provide theoretical basis for the efficient peach-Morchella planting and soil management after Morchella cultivation. Methods. Next-generation sequencing was performed to investigate the variations in soil physicochemical properties, enzyme activities and fungal composition under peach-Morchella intercropping for one year and two years, by using the soil without peach-Morchella intercropping as the control group. Results. Peach-Morchella intercropping decreased the soil bulk density, and significantly increased the maximum field capacity, non-capillary porosity and total porosity, organic matter, available potassium and available zinc, which together improved soil structure and soil fertility. Besides, the intercropping mode obviously enhanced soil enzyme activities and mineral absorption and transformation in peach orchard soils. The intercropping also resulted in a decline of soil fungal diversity, and the 2-year soil samples were of higher abundance of Zygomycota. More importantly, peach-Morchella intercropping elevated the yields of both peach and Morchella, bringing about obviously higher economic benefits. Conclusion. Continuous peach-Morchella intercropping improves the soil structure and fertility while decreases soil fungal diversity, which can contribute to greater economic benefits of the peach orchard. Our findings shed new light on the intercropping-fungus-soil relationship, and may facilitate the further development of peach-Morchella intercropping.

Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate soil properties in relation to erosion in areas with different cropping system practices under no-tillage in the Brazilian Cerrado. The experiment has been carried out since 2014 in a Typic Haplustox under soybean (S) and maize (M) monoculture, maize/soybean annual rotation (MS), maize/brachiaria/soybean/brachiaria rotation (MBSB), two of those treatments with high input of fertilizer (MBSB-HI and MS-HI), and bare soil (BS). Soil losses were quantified in erosion plots. The design was completely randomized. The greater vegetation cover crop, provided by intercropping/succession with brachiaria, increased microbial biomass carbon. The lack of vegetation cover affected the basal soil respiration and metabolic quotient. Basal soil respiration proved to be inversely related to soil and water losses. Vegetation cover was a key factor regulating water erosion. Penetration resistance and aggregate stability correlated with soil and water losses. Thus, not only physical and chemical, but also biological properties are deeply affected by erosion, aiding in early monitoring of water erosion. Soil quality improvement in ecologically supported management contributes to mitigating erosion."

Weeds provide many ecosystemic services for soil protection and support biodiversity, and could mitigate the negative effects of intensification. We investigated the changes in weed assemblages and weed-soil interactions on a chronosequence from annual crops to mature rubber tree plantations. We sampled five fields for each of four land uses in mountainous northern Thailand (rainfed upland rice, maize, young rubber tree (RT) intercropped with maize, and mature RT). We characterized weed assemblages (abundance, richness) and soil properties (bulk density, water, carbon and nitrogen content). Rice had the most diverse and abundant weed assemblages. Weed assemblages differed between (i) rice, (ii) maize and young RT with maize and (iii) mature RT. Soil water content was the highest in mature RT. Other soil properties varied strongly within and among fields, and did not vary significantly among land uses. Water and nitrogen content increased overall with living soil cover but decreased with weed species richness in mature RT. Such interactions could provide a basis for sustainable weeding practices favourable to soil and biodiversity conservation.

In particular, the excessive application of chemical fertilizer has led to large emissions of reactive nitrogen compounds into the atmosphere, where they become significant components of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution. Intercropping has been considered as a sustainable agricultural practice that can reduce the environmental impacts of agriculture, but its potential benefits beyond the farm scale have rarely been examined. Here we develop a new parameterization scheme for belowground mutualistic interactions between intercropped crops in the DeNitificaiton-DeComposition biogeochemical model, which is then used to simulate and quantify the benefits of nationwide adoption of maize-soybean systems in China in terms of gains in crop production, decreases in fertilizer consumption, and reductions in ammonia (NH3) emission. We further examine how such a decline in NH3 emission could lessen the downwind formation of PM2.5 using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model. We show that annual mean inorganic PM2.5 concentrations can be reduced by up to 1.5 mu g m(-3) with the nationwide adoption of maize-soybean intercropping, with a corresponding annual net economic benefit of US$67 billion, of which US$13 billion arises from saved health costs from reduced air pollution. This study demonstrates the economic and environmental values of intercropping systems in dually promoting food security and environmental health, which can serve as a basis for policy consideration as governments and stakeholders explore more sustainable farming options.

Four cereal species: wheat, triticale, rye and oat and one legume (pea) were included in investigation that carried out on field experimental conditions during one vegetation season. Each species were sown in monocrops and in intercrops wheat + pea, triticale + pea, rye + pea and oat + pea. Harvest index of spike variate between 65.2% (triticale intercrops) and 86.5% (oat solo). The values of spike weight and seed weight was different among the cereal species and higher in intercrops than in monocrop system of cultivation. However, only for rye in mixture with pea, harvest index 78.8%) was higher than in monocrops of rye (77.0%). Harvest index of pod variate in ratio 50.3% (pea solo) and 69.5% (in intercrops pea + rye). The values of pod weight and seed weight pod(-1) was different and higher in intercrops than in monocrops system of cultivation. Harvest pod index of peas was significantly higher in mixture with each small grains species genotypes than in pea's monocrops. On the base of result we can conclude that intercropping cereals + peas, have positive effect on spike and pod characteristics which values were higher in intercrops than in monocrops.

Calculation of land equivalent ratios showed that plant growth factors were used from 25 to 38% more efficiently by the intercrop than by the sole crops. Barley sole crops accumulated 65 kg soil N ha(-1) in aboveground plant parts, which was similar to 73 kg soil N ha(-1) in the pea-barley intercrop and significantly greater than 15 kg soil N ha(-1) in the pea sole crop. The weeds accumulated 57 kg soil N ha(-1) in aboveground plant parts during the growing season in the pea sole crops. Intercropped barley accumulated 71 kg N ha(-1). Pea relied on N-2 fixation with 90-95% of aboveground N accumulation derived from N-2 fixation independent of cropping system. Pea grown in intercrop with barley instead of sole crop had greater competitive ability towards weeds and soil inorganic N was consequently used for barley grain production instead of weed biomass. There was no indication of a greater inorganic N content after pea compared to barley or pea-barley. However, 46 days after emergence there was about 30 kg N ha(-1) inorganic N more under the pea sole crop than under the other two crops. Such greater inorganic N levels during early growth phases was assumed to induce aggressive weed populations and interspecific competition. Pea-barley intercropping seems to be a promising practice of protein production in cropping systems with high weed pressures and low levels of available N. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

There is an urgent need to develop and disseminate more sustainable vegetable production systems. Intercropping, the simultaneous cultivation of two or more crops on the same field, is widely practiced in the region. Intercropping can use environmental resources more efficiently and is therefore considered to generate high and stable yields with lower inputs. Until now, scientific literature on vegetable intercropping in China is non-existent. To identify prevailing vegetable intercropping systems, a qualitative inquiry was conducted in southern Hebei province. Researchers, extensionists and farmers were interviewed on the occurrence, methods, potentials and constraints of vegetable intercropping. Furthermore, semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted to examine the farmers' underlying motives and concepts and to determine the origin and distribution of the systems. The investigations revealed a huge variety of sophisticated systems being practiced in southern Hebei. Apart from pure vegetable intercropping systems such as spinach-garlic, especially maize-vegetable and cotton-vegetable systems are widespread. The systems are developed by the farmers themselves and disseminated by the state extension service. Apart from the benefits of plant health, the optimal use of limited land resources is the main reason for farmers to exercise intercropping. However, with the ongoing mechanization and labor force reduction in the agricultural sector, a great part of the intercropping systems, which demand a high input of manual labor, are prone to extinction in the long run. Recent research in China focused purely on agronomic advantages of intercropping, neglecting the linkages between the socio-economic developments and farmers' decisions in the field. To overcome this dilemma and to maintain the traditional and sustainable intercropping systems, we conclude that only an integrative research approach that involves various stakeholders from the beginning is able to adjust the intercropping systems to future demands.

There are only a few current long-term studies on this topic. Our study aimed at analyzing yield and competitiveness as well as the economic indicators of spring cereals in pure or mixed sowings in integrated or organic crop rotations over nine years. A field experiment including pure sowings of oats, spring barley, or spring triticale and their two-component SCMs, each in two systems, organic and integrated crop rotation, was carried out in the Mountainous Experimental Station in Czyrna, Poland, in the years 2011-2019. On average, cereals in the pure sowings and mixtures yielded 18% lower in the organic rotations compared with the integrated ones. However, SCMs yielded higher than the pure sowings, and displayed a higher leaf area index and land equivalent ratio. The average gross margin without subsidies was almost two times higher in the organic crop rotations than in the integrated ones, which was influenced mainly by the cultivation of barley in pure sowing. Summing up, the cultivation of SCMs in the mountainous areas of southern Poland is advised because of both productive and economic factors.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						"Dry matter yield; Essential oil constituents; Phenolic compounds; Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria; Planting pattern"	"ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; ESSENTIAL OIL; USE EFFICIENCY; MAIZE; COMPONENTS; DIVERSITY; RADIATION"	The study was aimed to investigate the effects of bacterial fertilizer (BF) application and planting patterns on quantitative and qualitative yield of savory intercropped with common bean. An experiment was performed using a factorial based on randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. The factors included microbial inoculation (mix of nitrogen-fixing + phosphate-solubilizing + potassium-solubilizing bacteria and non-inoculation), and planting patterns [one row of savory + one row of common bean (1S:1CB), two rows of common bean + two rows of savory (2S:2CB), two rows of savory + one row of common bean (2S:1CB), one row of savory + two rows of common bean (1S:2CB), as well as the pure culture of both plants]. The results showed that the seed yield of common bean and dry matter yield of savory was recorded in pure culture conditions treated with BF. The 2CB:2S intercropping pattern with BF fertilization produced the highest essential oil (EO) content of savory (1.96%). In addition, the application of BF enhanced the EO yield of savory by 35% compared to control. The major constituents of savory EO were carvacrol, gamma-terpinene, alpha-terpinene, p-cymene, and beta-myrcene. The 2CB:1S intercropping pattern with BF fertilization produced the maximum content of carvacrol and p- cymene. The maximum content of phenolic compounds including rosmarinic acid, coumaric acid, chlorogenic acid, cinnamic acid, and apigenin was recorded in the intercropping pattern of 2CB:2S treated with BF. Overall, intercropping pattern of 2CB:2S treated with BF could be recommended to farmers as eco-friendly strategies to improve EO quality and quantity as well as phenolic compounds.

This work was conducted over 3.5 years to determine the effect on NO3- leaching, water balance and soil mineral N accumulation of replacing fallow with CC in irrigated systems. Treatments studied during the maize (Zea mays L) intercrop period were: barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), vetch (Vicia villosa L) and fallow. Soil water content was monitored daily to a depth of 1.3 m and used with the numerical model WAVE to describe the water balance. Determination of crop canopy parameters was based on digital image analysis, and root depth in capacitance sensor readings. Nitrate leaching was calculated multiplying drainage by the soil solution nitrate concentration. Soil mineral N was determined before sowing CC and maize. Over the study, cumulative nitrate leaching in the fallow, vetch, and barley was 346, 245, and 129 kg N-NO3- ha(-1), respectively: occurring more than 77% during the intercrop period. In dry winters. NO3- accumulated in the topsoil, and CC controlled the NO3- leaching during the initial maize growth stages. Vetch was less efficient than barley at controlling leaching, but enhanced soil N retention. The CC controlled NO3- leaching and recycled N inside the cropping system. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

At two agricultural sites in Central Kenya differing in elevation and soil type Haplic Nitisols (eutric) and Vitric Gleysols (eutric, epiclayic, endoclayic), we investigated the vertical root distributions using the trench wall profile method in single-crop systems of maize (Zea mays L.) and in intercropping systems of maize and legumes (common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L.; pigeon pea, Cajanus cajan [L.] Millsp.) to test for possible differences in the use of water and nutrient resources. The physico-chemical soil properties of the sites were similar and imposed no restrictions to the vertical growth of the roots into soil depths of 1.4 m. The vertical distributions of the fine roots (empty set 0.5-2 mm) and very fine roots (empty set < 0.5 mm) were quantified by calculating the parameter beta which was computed from the cumulative fraction (Y) of the root densities along the depth (d) of the soil profiles (Y = 1 - beta(d)). We found no consistent differences between the single-crop and the intercropping systems in the rooting depth down to 1.4 m. However, higher beta values for fine roots of the intercropping systems were indicative of a more homogeneous vertical root distribution than in the single-crop fields. In the intercropping fields, 50% of the total number of fine roots were distributed over the uppermost 36 cm of the soil, whereas in the single-crop fields, 50% of the fine roots were concentrated in the uppermost 15-21 cm. Medium-sized roots (empty set > 2-5 mm) were detected in the intercropping fields only.

The experimental crops were maize, beans, intercrop (of maize and beans) and bare fallow (control). Natural rainfall and standard cultural management were used. In all the treatments, the percent of soil splashed downslope was more than that upslope. The amount of soil splashed downslope was about 7 times that upslope on bare fallow land, and about 6 times under the maize crop. Under beans and intercrop, the proportion of splash downslope was comparatively lower. It was also found that the amount of soil splashed downslope decreased exponentially with increase in crop cover. Crop height was independent of the soil splash both in the downslope and also upslope direction.

Mungbean was intercropped with cotton under two planting techniques practiced in Punjab for cotton sowing. Treatments consist of mungbean broadcast in 75 cm spaced drilled cotton rows (IS1), alternative rows of cotton and mungbean (IS2), two rows of mungbean between cotton rows (IS3) while in fourth treatment (IS4) two mungbean rows were sown on top of 105 cm wide double ridge-furrow (beds hereafter). Results showed that mungbean presence adversely affected the number of opened, total bolls plant(-1), opened boll percentage and seed cotton yield in all intercropping systems. However in bed intercropping, cotton produced 21.84 % higher seed cotton yield than sole cotton. Alike, number of pods plant(-1) and number of grains pod(-1) of mungbean decreased in intercropping treatments compared to sole mungbean. On average, mungbean yield was 21.1 % less in intercropping treatments than sole mungbean. Yield advantage indicated by LER and ATER values was observed in all intercropping treatments except in IT3 where ATER suggested disadvantage. Highest LER (1.92) and ATER (1.58) were recorded in IS4. Aggressivity value indicates that bed structure favoured the cotton growth compared to mungbean. All intercropping systems showed positive values of system productivity index and monitory advantage index. This study concludes that productivity of late season cotton could be better enhanced by sowing two rows of mungbean on top of the 105 cm wide cotton beds.

Although the use of insecticides for controlling B. tabaci has been effective to a certain extent, pesticides are not an acceptable long-term control method, and alternatives should be sought. This paper focuses on the possibility of controlling B. tabaci on cotton using trap and barrier crops. We performed field experiments using cantaloupe (Cucumis melo) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus) as trap crops, and maize (Zea mays) as a barrier crop in various configurations in Hebei Province, North China. RESULTS The main activity periods were shortest on cantaloupe and ranged between 16-32 days for immatures and 14-33 days for adults. Adult whitefly densities were not significantly reduced by any treatment. During the main activity period, maize intercropping reduced densities of immature whiteflies from 24.2 individuals (ind.) 100 cm(-2) to 4.0 ind.100 cm(-2), but all treatments were successful in significantly reducing immature B. tabaci densities. This resulted in a significant yield premium. CONCLUSIONS Intercropping reduced B. tabaci densities on cotton more than perimeter planting. Maize was more effective to reduce densities of immature whiteflies on cotton than cantaloupe. The results will contribute to the development of more effective and practical approaches for protecting cotton from B. tabaci and lowering chemical pressure on this crop.

Czernj. & Cosson] with barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), rocket salad (Eruca sativa Mill.) and linseed (Linum usitatissimum L.) on yield, water-use efficiency, competition indices and monetary returns under limited irrigation conditions. Indian mustard-based intercropping systems were found more productive than sole cropping of Indian mustard. Indian mustard + linseed intercropping system recorded the highest Indian mustard equivalent yield (1 995 kg/ha), water-use efficiency (10.31 kg/ha-mm), land-equivalent ratio (1.63) and monetary returns (Rs 17 982/ha), whereas Indian mustard + barley intercropping system recorded the lowest yield, water-use efficiency, land-equivalent ratio and returns. Barley and rocket salad were found dominant and linseed dominated as judged by the values of relative crowding coefficient and aggressivity. The yield of crops progressively increased with number of irrigation and the average increase was 33 and 58% with 1 and 2 irrigation respectively. However, water-use efficiency decreased by 11% with 1 irrigation and 21% with 2 irrigation. The monetary returns increased with increasing levels of irrigation.

The total GE yield of the three-course rotations increased by 3.0 and 3.6% in the first and second rotations, respectively. After foliage crops, no significant interactions between GE yields and the different tillage methods for winter wheat cropping were found.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of pasture renewal systems on the microbiological and structural quality of a medium-texture Oxisol. A randomized blocks design was adopted, with four replications and eight pasture renewal systems: 1) soybean/off-season maize/soybean; 2) soybean/maize-grass intercropping/soybean; 3) grass for 10 months and then one soybean crop; 4) grass + rattlepod for 10 months and then one soybean crop; 5) grass for 13 months and then one soybean crop; 6) grass + rattlepod for 13 months and then one soybean crop; 7) one soybean crop; 8) original pasture (control). The microbiological quality was assessed based on soil microbial biomass carbon, soil microbial activity, microbial metabolic quotient - qCO(2) and activity of the beta-glucosidase enzyme; and the structural quality based on the soil structural quality index. The implementation of pasture renewal systems with grass as a single crop (systems 3 and 5) or intercropped with rattlepod (systems 4 and 6) improves the soil microbiological and structural quality.

Farmers attempting to correct these conditions are often confused by the spatial and symptomatic irregularity of affected plants and, until recently, no soil management product was commercially available that is specifically formulated to restore soil fertility to these patches. PREP-PAC consists of 2.0 kg of Minjingu rock phosphate (RP), 200 g of urea, seeds of various symbiotic nitrogen-fixing food legumes, rhizobial inoculant, gum arabic seed adhesive; lime for seed pelleting, and instructions for the use of these materials. It is intended for addition to 25 m(2) and produced at a cost of $0.56 per unit. The general principle is to apply slowly available RP sufficient for several cropping seasons with readily available nitrogenous fertilizer and to intercrop farmer's maize (Zea mays) with a legume that provides residual fixed-nitrogen and organic inputs to the soil. This approach was tested in on-farm experiments conducted in collaboration with several grassroots rural development organizations. An experiment examined interactions between PREP-PAC components in a maize-soybean (Glycine max) intercrop in nutrient-depleted soils with sandy and clayey surface horizons. The treatments included +/-RP, +/-urea, and +/-inoculants arranged as a 2(3) factorial with four replicates at each location. Total value of the intercrops ranged between $0.83 in the unamended plots and $2.44 in plots treated with PREP-PAC. Significant positive effects were observed with the addition of RP (P < 0.001), urea (P = 0.04), and inoculant (P = 0.01) and in interactions between RP and urea (P = 0.02) or inoculant (P = 0.07). The return ratio to PREP-PAC investment was 2.6 in the sandy soil and 3.7 in the clay. PREP-PACs were tested on-farm in 52 symptomatic patches containing maize-bean intercrops with and without an improved variety of climbing Phaseolus vulgaris cv. Flora. Unamended patches (25 m(2) = 0.0025 ha) produced 1.6 kg maize and 0.08 kg bean. With addition of PREP-PAC containing Flora, yields increased to 4.1 kg maize and 1.1 kg bean (P < 0.001 for both crops). Improvement in bean yield during the first cropping season nearly offset PREP-PAC's investment costs. PREP-PAC is a strategic approach because all of its ingredients, except for urea, originate from East Africa, and are relatively inexpensive; the product is intended for distribution through existing retail and development networks.

Two bi-crops drilled at pea to wheat ratios of 25:75 (low pea; LP) or 75:25 (high pea; HP) on a dry matter (DM) basis were grown on each half of 6.5 and 3.5 ha fields and harvested after either 13 (cut 1; C 1) or 15 (cut 2; C2) weeks of growth. The four resulting forages were ensiled in separate 40 t clamp silos and evaluated against a perennial ryegrass (PRG) silage, as a control, in an in vivo digestibility trial. Each forage was fed with 7 g of mineral/vitamin supplement daily to four Lleyns wether sheep for a 14-day adaptation period and a 10-day balance period. Daily forage intake and total faecal and urine output were measured and N balance was estimated. The mean DM contents at C1 and C2 were 301 and 333 g/kg while the mean proportions of peas in the LP and HP treatments were 402 and 729 g/kg DM, respectively. C2 bi-crops had higher crude protein (CP) (P<0.05), starch (P<0.001) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF; P<0.01) contents than C1 bi-crops while the HP treatment gave higher pea to wheat ratios at harvest (P<0.001) in vivo digestibility values and CP contents (P<0.01) than the LP treatment. Nevertheless, there were significant interactions between pea to wheat ratio and maturity. The LP C2 bi-crop silage had the highest (P<0.05), DM, water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC), starch and NDF contents and metabolisable energy (ME) value and gave the highest, DM, digestible DM and ME intakes, N retention and N balance. Compared to the PRG silage which was moderate in quality, the bi-crops had higher (P<0.05), CP, starch and WSC contents and gave higher DM, digestible DM and ME intakes, and better N retention and N balance. This study shows that the LP C2 had similar nutritive to the other bi-crops value but gave better animal performance. The work, also suggests that pea-wheat bi-crops can be fed to livestock instead of average quality grass silage. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

In 1991 and 1992, an experiment was conducted in Truro, Nova Scotia, and Sussex, New Brunswick, to determine whether later soybean varieties can provide sufficient biomass and protein in intercrops and escape pod losses at harvest. Early, early high protein, medium, late and very late maturing varieties of soybean were grown as monocrops and intercrops with corn. Eight response variables were measured: soybean shoot biomass yield, intercrop shoot biomass yield, soybean shoot protein concentration, intercrop shoot protein concentration, soybean shoot protein yield, intercrop shoot protein yield, soybean seed biomass yield and soybean seed protein concentration. The two later soybean varieties had higher yields than the two early varieties, contributing to higher protein yields in the later varieties than in the early varieties, under both monocropping and intercropping. In contrast to the corn monocrop, intercrops with all soybean varieties produced higher protein concentrations. Under intercropping, only the late variety produced significantly higher protein yields than the corn monocrop; however, none of the varieties resulted in significantly lower biomass yields than the corn monocrop. With the late soybean variety, land equivalent ratios of the intercrop shoot biomass yield and the intercrop shoot protein yield revealed yield advantages of intercrops over monocrops of 21% and 10%, respectively. The late variety resulted in an increased intercrop shoot protein concentration without reducing the intercrop shoot biomass yield, because it was still green enough to be harvested with minimal pod shattering."

The experiment was established during the 2010/11 and 2011/12 crop years in the rural area near the municipality of Bom Jesus, Piaui. The experimental design was a randomized block in a split-plot array. Different soil management systems (conventional and no-till) were evaluated in the main plots. Different crop production systems consisting of cover crops sown in the off-season (April to November), and annual crops sown during the crop season (November to April) were implemented in the subplots. The crop production systems that included Urochloa ruziziensis and Pennisetum glaucum overseeded on soybeans and Urochloa ruziziensis simultaneously intercropped with maize stood out in terms of biomass production and the accumulation and release of nutrients. Yields of maize and upland rice declined when sown under newly implemented no-till soil management.

However, depending on crop combinations, one crop may dominate and decrease the growth of the other. Interactions in the soil, especially in the rhizosphere, may be important in the interactions between intercropped plant genotypes. To assess the role of the rhizosphere interactions, we intercropped a P-inefficient wheat genotype (Janz) with either the P-efficient wheat genotype (Goldmark) or chickpea in a soil with low P availability amended with 100 mg P kg(-1) as FePO4 (FeP) or phytate. The plants were grown for 10 weeks in pots where the roots of the genotypes could intermingle (no barrier, NB), were separated by a 30 mu m mesh (mesh barrier, MB), preventing direct root contact but allowing exchange of diffusible compounds and microorganisms, or were completely separated by a solid barrier (SB). When supplied with FeP, Janz intercropped with chickpea had higher shoot and grain dry weight (dw) and greater plant P uptake in NB and MB than in SB. Contact with roots of Janz increased shoot, grain and root dw, root length, shoot P concentration and shoot P uptake of chickpea compared to SB. Root contact between the two wheat genotypes, Janz and Goldmark, had no effect on growth and P uptake of Janz. Shoot and total P uptake by Goldmark were significantly increased in NB compared to MB or SB. In both crop combinations, root contact significantly increased total plant dw and P uptake per pot. Plant growth and P uptake were lower with phytate and not significantly affected by barrier treatment. Differences in microbial P, available P and phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere among genotypes and barrier treatments were generally small. Root contact changed microbial community structure (assessed by fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis) and all crops had similar rhizosphere microbial community structure when their roots intermingled.

However, the soil As remediation effects and the related mechanisms of P. vittata intercropping with different crops are rarely reported. In this study, by use of soil microplot experiment and root zone separation technique, the intercropping modes of P. vittata with maize (Zea mays L.), ramie (Boehmeria nivea (L.) Gaudich.) and castor (Ricinus communis L.) were designed to investigate the As and nutrient uptake and accumulation, antioxidant enzyme response, soil As fractionation, and the remediation effects of As contaminated soil by P. vittata-crop intercropping. The results showed that the intercropping increased As content of P. vittata by 3.1-25.3%, decreased As content of maize grains and leaves of ramie and castor by 70.9%-95.6%, 29.2%-32.0% and 18.8%-32.0%, respectively, indicating higher remediation efficiency by P. vittata-crop intercropping. The intercropping increased the total nutrient contents (NPK) of the three crops by 2.0%-91.1%, promoted plant biomass by 3.7%-111.0%, increased the transpiration rate by 4.9%-68.9%, and decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) content by 7.0%-31.8%. Analysis also showed that the intercropping enhanced soil pH value and available As content in P. vittata rhizosphere. The proportion of iron-bound As was enhanced in P. vittata rhizosphere soil but decreased in three crops rhizosphere soil. The analysis of soil microbial diversity showed that the intercropping decreased the abundance of chloroflexi, increased the abundance of proteobacteria and actinobacteria. In summary, the P. vittata-crop intercropping had a positive significance for improving As remediation effect of P. vittata and reducing the As content in crops. Those modes could be applied in the practice of heavy metal contamination remediation along with crop production in farmland. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study investigates the fertilizing potential of separated biogas digestates. These contain valuable nutrients and can be used in agriculture to close the nutrient cycle. Multi-year field experiments were established at two challenging sites in south-west Germany in 2010; results from 6 years are shown here. The objectives were to determine (1) whether separated digestates can complement or substitute mineral fertilizers and (2) their effect on long-term yield performance in different biomass cropping and fertilization systems. The fertilizing performance was assessed in a split-plot design with four replications using three cropping systems: (1) perennial grassland; (2) intercropping of triticale and clover grass; (3) silage maize. Five N fertilization treatments were applied, each at 150 kg N ha(-1): mineral fertilizer (calcium ammonium nitrate) combined solid digestate fraction and mineral fertilizer solid digestate fraction combined liquid digestate fraction and mineral fertilizer liquid digestate fraction. The influences of site, cropping system, year and fertilization treatment were highly significant.The mineral fertilizer and combination liquid digestate fraction + mineral fertilizer mostly led to the highest quantitative biomass yields in all cropping systems at both sites. Fertilization with solid digestate fraction produced lowest yields in all fertilized plots, with results very often not significantly different from the untreated control. Maize achieved relatively high yields in years with favorable weather conditions; unfavorable conditions led to low yields. The grassland and intercropping systems were less susceptible to weather conditions, producing a more constant biomass supply irrespective of site, treatment and year. The separated biogas digestates were found to have a comparable effect to mineral fertilizer on biomass yield, but this varied with cropping system. In the intercropping system, complete substitution was possible. The solid fraction is more likely to contribute positively to soil humus in annual systems. In general, the combined application of digestate and mineral fertilizer is highly recommendable to meet crops' short- and long-term N demand, even on challenging sites. In this study, it allowed a mineral fertilizer input reduction of 66%."

J	"Feyisa, TH; Aune, JB"				"Feyisa, TH; Aune, JB"			Khat expansion in the Ethiopian Highlands - Effects on the farming system in Habro District	MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						"Khat; intercropping; peasant associations; drug consumption; Ethiopian highlands"		"Khat (Catha edulis) is a rapidly expanding perennial crop in the Ethiopian highlands, and it is Ethiopia's second largest export item. The leaves of the crop are used for their stimulating effect. The present study was undertaken in Habro district in western Hararghie. Khat production in this district is rapidly replacing cereal production and to some extent coffee production. About 70% of farmers' income in the study area is currently obtained from khat. One important reason for the expansion of khat production is that the khat-maize intercropping system is 2.7 times more profitable per hectare than maize monocropping. Khat is also less risky to grow than cereals and coffee because it is less vulnerable to drought. Increased production leads to changes in livestock composition because oxen are far less needed for plowing in the khat-based system; moreover, availability of crop residues for fodder is reduced when khat expands. Khat growing farmers, therefore, give more emphasis to milk-producing animals such as cows and goats. It was found that khat producers also are consumers of khat and that khat consumption has become widespread in the nearby secondary school. Khat consumption negatively affects people's working capacity. Hence, unskilled khat consumers in urban areas are paid 7 birr (US$0.84) per day, whereas nonkhat users are paid 10 birr (US$1.22). Measures to control further khat expansion will need to address both supply and demand."

J	"Gijsman, AJ; Sanz, JI"				"Gijsman, AJ; Sanz, JI"			Soil organic matter pools in a volcanic-ash soil under fallow or cultivation with applied chicken manure	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article							"ALLOPHANIC SOILS; DECOMPOSITION"	Frequent applications of chicken manure to a volcanic-ash soil resulted in an increased crop yield several years after the applications ceased. Improved nutrient cycling through the soil organic matter (SOM) was thought be the cause of this. An area that for several years had been under either unimproved fallow or continuous bean-maize intercropping (with chicken manure application) was planted with maize intercropped with the legume Arachis pintoi. Soil samples were fractionated into several sizes of aggregates and incubated for 6 weeks in intact form and after crushing the aggregates. Between 1.2 and 3.1% of the C in any aggregate size class existed in easily decomposable (i.e. not physically or chemically protected) form. Less than 0.8% of the macroaggregate C was physically protected by the aggregate structure. More than 97% of the C in any aggregate size class can be considered resistant. The large- or small-macroaggregate-protected SOM (i.e. in aggregates > 2000 mu m and 250-2000 mu m, respectively), once made available, was more easily decomposed than the unprotected SOM. The large SOM content (45.8-57.3 g C kg(-1)) but yet limited mineralizability indicates that mechanisms other than soil macroaggregation are important for protecting SOM in this soil. Binding of organic molecules onto allophane minerals is likely to be such a mechanism. The larger yield and nutrient uptake by the maize in the former bean-maize plots compared with the former fallow plots could not be explained by differences in SOM decomposition. We think that the frequent applications of chicken manure to the former bean-maize plots increased the available phosphorus in these strongly P-sorbing soils by increasing the cycling of organic-P or by blocking some of the P-reactive sites. This, however, needs to be further investigated.

In desert oasis farmlands, environmental issues caused by N loss from excessive chemical N application have been previously reported. However, assessed N loss from desert oasis farmland ecosystems in northwestern China is lacking. Here, we assess the effects of cropping system and fertilizer rates on N loss rate in a desert oasis farmland, based on the 5-year monitoring data of N input and output. Maize/wheat yield and biomass N showed strong interannual variations and strongly related to N fertilizer rate. Soil total N and available N in the surface soil (0-20 cm) increased slightly, and N stock in 0-100 cm exhibited an increasing trend during the experiment period in all four cropping systems. 20.1-55.1% of input N were estimated to be lost to the environment, and sandy texture in new farmlands tends to promote N loss. New reclaimed farmland with sandy texture tends to increase N loss, but maize/wheat intercropping with alfalfa can alleviate it. We concluded that the maize/wheat intercropping with alfalfa could be an effective management practice to reduce N loss and improve N fertilizer use effectivity. However, avoided land transition from desert to farmland, and thus reduced the area of new oasis farmland could be the most essential strategy to reduce N loss in the desert oasis farmland ecosystems in northwestern China.

In this paper, we study how exposure to dry spells influences use and use intensity of ISFM technologies, specifically focusing on maize-legume intercropping and organic manure. We use a four-round panel dataset collected from households in six Malawi districts over a period of nine years and merged with daily rainfall data from the Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services. The results using correlated random effects models reveal that exposure to one-year lag of late-season dry spells is associated with high likelihood of use and use intensity of organic manure and maize-legume intercropping. However, there is an inconsistent effect of two-year and three-year lags of both early-season and late-season dry spells on the use and use intensity of both technologies. We respectively attribute these positive and inconsistent impacts to farmers' perceived and delayed benefits of the technologies under dry spells. We recommend that promotion messages should properly package the technologies to include those with immediate and delayed but enduring effects and sensitize the farmers on the same.

Giridhara"			Cropping systems options in relation to ENSO phase for Nandyal in Andhra Pradesh-A simulation analysis	JOURNAL OF AGROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article	International Symposium on Agrometeorology and Food Security	FEB 18-21, 2008	CRIDA, Hyderabad, INDIA		CRIDA	"Rainfall prediction; ENSO condition; cropping systems; climatic risk"	"SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; CLIMATE; VARIABILITY; PREDICTION; PATTERNS"	In rainfed environments, the productivity of cropping systems is primarily determined by the amount and distribution of rainfall. In southern India, the ENSO condition to some degree determines the potential of the ensuing rainy season in terms of amount of summer monsoon rainfall that is likely to be received in the region. Although it is difficult to predict the distribution of rainfall at a site or region, the prediction of rainfall amount would help farmers to plan cropping strategies to minimize climatic risks to crop production. Using crop simulation models and long-term weather records (1961 to 2006), productivity and net income of three sequential cropping systems (maize-chickpea, soybean-chickpea and groundnut-chickpea) and three intercrop systems (maize/pigeonpea, soybean/pigeonpea and groundnut/pigeonpea) were evaluated for the three ENSO conditions for Nandyal situated in the Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh. The simulation analysis showed that groundnut-chickpea sequential, groundnut/pigeonpea and soybean/pigeonpea intercrop systems during the La-Nina years, while maize/pigeonpea and groundnut/pigeonpea intercrop systems during the El Nino years gave higher net income at low risk among the cropping systems studied. During Neutral years, groundnut/pigeonpea intercrop systems was the most promising in terms of net income The study has demonstrated that assessing the potential of seasons based on ENSO condition would help farmers maximize incomes and reduce climatic risks by providing more efficient cropping systems options in the region.

Two field experiments during the 2019 and 2020 cropping seasons were conducted in Adet and Debre Tabor districts with the objective of evaluating the nutrient requirements of sweet lupine in bread wheat-sweet lupine under additive design intercropping systems. Sweet lupine grown in bread wheat-sweet lupine intercropping was fertilized with seven fertilizer levels (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 125%, and 150% of the blanket-recommended NP fertilizer rate of sole lupine) and laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The findings revealed that the highest grain yield of sweet lupine in wheat-sweet lupine intercropping system at Adet was achieved at 125% NP (0.51 t center dot ha(-1)) and 150% NP (0.52 t center dot ha(-1)), followed by 100% NP (0.43 t center dot ha(-1)) and 50% NP (0.35 t center dot ha(-1)) fertilizer levels of sweet lupine. Similarly, the highest grain yield of sweet lupine in Debre Tabor was recorded by the application of 125% NP (2.07 t ha(-1)) fertilizer level of sweet lupine followed by 150% NP (1.89 t center dot ha(-1)), 100% NP (1.71 t center dot ha(-1)), and 50% NP (1.70 t center dot ha(-1)) fertilizer levels. For every invested Ethiopian Birr in the treatments of 50% and 125% NP fertilizer levels of sweet lupine averaged additional profits of ETB 7.667 and ETB 4.537, respectively, can be obtained from sweet lupine that grew under bread wheat-sweet lupine intercropping system. Based on the averaged MRR across the different cost price ratio, application of 50% NP fertilizer level of sweet lupine can be recommended for profitable production of sweet lupine in bread wheat-sweet lupine under additive design intercropping system in Adet and Debre Tabor and areas with similar agroecology as it recorded the highest net return with acceptable marginal rate of return.

Using a questionnaire, 80 farmers were interviewed about crop production and selection practices in order to understand how these factors affect genetic diversity of local squash populations. We found that the most of the farmers who cultivate squash were elderly 59.8 +/- 14.5 (mean +/- SD; n = 78) years old. Squash varieties in the area were exclusively locally adapted landraces, and had not been replaced by modern squash cultivars. Two cultivated squash species, C. argyrosperma ssp. argyrosperma and C. moschata, had been grown intercropped with maize by 97.5% of the interviewed farmers, but only 50.0% were still producing squash at the time of the study. Farmers recognize typical characteristics of particular varieties within each of the local cultivated squash species, and selection is directed to maintain their identity. Nearly two thirds of the farmers (62.0%) had exchanged seeds of squash for planting, a practice that serves to increase genetic variability in the populations. All of the interviewed farmers were conscious of the possible hybridization between the wild gourd (C. argyrosperma ssp. sororia) and their cultivated squash. Despite various natural and human managed factors identified as contributing to enhancement of genetic diversity in these populations, results of the study show that genetic erosion of Cucurbita is likely in the region in the near future."

Nitrogen transfers from decaying litters were measured by placing N-15-labelled litters from four actinorhizal tree species around shoots of containerized Prunus avium. Nitrogen transfers by root-to-root exchanges were measured after foliar NO3-N-15 fertilization of Alnus subcordata and Elaeagnus angustifolia growing in containers in association with P. avium. During the first 2 years of litter decomposition, from 5-20% of the N, depending on the litter identity, was released and taken up by P. avium. N availability in the different litters was strongly correlated with the amount of water-soluble N, which was highest in leaves of E. angustifolia. In the association between fixing and non-fixing plants, 7.5% of the A. subcordata N and 25% of E. angustifolia N was transferred to P. avium by root exchange. These results showed that the magnitude of N transfers by root exchange depended on the associated N-2-fixing species. Among the species investigated, E. angustifolia displayed the highest capacity for exudating N from roots as well as for releasing N from litters. These qualities make this tree a promising species for enhancing wood yields in mixed stands.

Cropping system I comprised oat-vetch (Avena sativa-Vicia dasycarpa), wheat-trifolium (Triticum aestivum-Trifolium steudneri), teff (Eragrostis tef) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata). Cropping system 2 had maizee-lablab (Zea mays-lablab purpureus) instead of wheat-trifolium. Treatments comprised ad libitum teff straw alone (TI), teff straw plus wheat middlings (T2) forages from cropping system I fed in the order and length (days) oat-vetch (112), wheat-trifolium plus cowpea hay (70) and teff straw plus cowpea hay (70) (T3) or forages from cropping system 2 fed in the same order and length (days) (T4). Cowpea hay and wheat middlings were supplemented at 1% of body weight. Maize-Lablab and oats-vetch forages contained similar levels of CP which were higher than that in. wheat-trifolium. The basal teff straw did not meet the calcium (Ca) and phosphrous (P) needs of the steers (TI). However, supplementation with cowpea hay satisfied all mineral needs and improved DM disappearance (P<0.01) from nylon bags. Steers on T2 gained more (P<0.01) live weight and were more (P<0.01) efficient than steers on T4 (541 vs 373; 0.10 vs 0.08) which in turn were superior (P<0.05) to those on T3 (280; 0.06). Whereas, the intakes of oat-vetch were similar (3.8 vs 3.7 kg/hd/day) resulting to similar growth rate (200 vs 234 g/day) between T3 and T4, the intake of wheat-trifolium plus cowpea hay (T3) was 5% higher than that of maize-lablab plus cowpea hay. However, the superior digestibility of maize-lablab plus cowpea hay resulted in 1.1 times increased digestible organic matter intake which could explain the superior growth rate of T4 steers (411 vs 283). The inferior feeding value of forages from cropping system I (T3) could be attributed to leaf shattering of the trifolium component. It was concluded that the intercropped feeds were still deficient in CP and energy and should not be used as sole feed."

A comparison of the protein contents in intercropped fodder plants irrigated with fresh water, and rainfall water, against those irrigated with treated grey water was performed under Palestinian climate conditions. Field experiments with different intercropping mixing ratios were carried out in 2017-2019 at the National Agricultural Research Centre in Palestine (NARC). Measurements of the nutritional value of each mixture specifically the protein contents were carried out to get the optimal and best conditions for preparing animal feed crops with three different water sources used. For alfalfa with vetch, the best result for protein percentages was (on average) obtained from the rain-fed experiment (17.1% protein) followed by the freshwater experiment (12.9% protein) and then by the treated grey-water experiment (12.6% protein). It appears that the best result for alfalfa with barley for protein percentages was (on average) obtained from the treated grey-water experiment (13.0% protein) followed by the freshwater experiment (11.1% protein) and then by the rain-fed experiment (10.5% protein). Statistical analysis of the data showed that percent protein for each specific mixing ratio resulted in significant differences in the protein % for the those irrigated with fresh water compared with the other types of water. The highest protein % was found to be for that irrigated with fresh water (31.9 for 10/90 alfalfa/barley ratio) followed by that irrigated with treated grey water (28.4 for 20/80 alfalfa/barley ratio) and then for the 30/70 ratio irrigated with treated wastewater (22.5%), and then for the 100/0 ratio of alfalfa/barley irrigated with rainwater (19.0). Overall, results of this study showed that cereal-legume intercropping irrigated with treated grey water can be used as a suitable management strategy for producing high-quality and high-quantity forage. Furthermore, the use of treated water can reduce the already strained demand on fresh water due to increase in population among other factors.

Farmer adaptation of starter technology by farmer research groups in Luapula Province, Zambia	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article								The participatory approach of Farmer Research Groups (FRGs) was used in Farmer Adaptation of Starter Technology (FAST) with small-scale farmers in Luapula Province, Zambia. The introduction of a starter technology, proved to be a suitable method to induce self-help initiatives with farmers. Their first move in FAST related to the improvement of food security and income generation by the cultivation and marketing of new maize (Zea mays) varieties in wetlands during the dry and early rainy seasons. By informal on-farm seed multiplication the expenditure on external agricultural inputs was reduced. The technical aspects of the starter technology began with the integration of pasture legumes as a pioneer crop for green manuring purposes in maize production, In this respect, FRGs developed individual risk-aversion strategies to ensure early planting of the maize with the onset of the rains. The groups made adaptations such as biomass transfer, intercropping and crop rotations in order to integrate pasture legumes into current cropping systems for green manuring purposes.

Intercropping is a kind of polyculture, growing two or more crops together. This practice should improve pest management mainly by increasing predator diversity. It was hypothesized that the intercropping of narrow-leafed lupin with spring triticale would increase the number and diversity of rove beetles compared to monocultures of the aforementioned crops. Objectives. The aim of the research was to determine the effect of intercropping of narrow-leafed lupin with spring triticale on rove beetle abundance and diversity. Method. Over a three-year period, rove beetles were trapped with the use of pitfall traps, and adults were identified to species. The experiment was carried out on a narrow-leafed lupin and spring triticale crop sown as monocultures, and on two mixtures with different proportions of lupin seeds. Results. In total, in all treatments 100 rove beetle species were found, classified into three trophic groups. The most numerous forms were predatory zoophages, which were followed by parasites and saprophages. Staphylinidae abundance and ecological significance decreased with increasing degree of habitat diversity in comparison to crops grown in the pure stand. The same response to intercropping was observed in the case of zoophages. Conclusions. Contrary to what was hypothesized, the abundance and diversity of rove beetle decreased when narrow-leafed lupin and spring triticale were grown together compared to their monoculture. Presumably, the higher abundance of rove beetle in lupin and spring triticale grown in the pure stand is mostly the result of better food supply in monocultures during the whole season.

Thrips were studied at the Experimental Research Station at Pawlowice, near Wroclaw, Lower Silesia, Poland, during the period 2010-2012. The experiment was designed as a split-plot with four replicates for each mixture of plants. Lupin and triticale were sown in three different proportions. For determination of thrips species composition narrow-leafed lupin plants were collected from the central part of each plot when plants were at the full blooming stage. In the laboratory larvae and adults were identified to species level. During the whole lupin growing season, insects were also counted weekly on 10 consecutive plants in the middle row of each plot. In two of the three years of the study, significantly more thrips were collected from lupin plants grown as single crop. There were no significant differences in the number of these insects between lupin-triticale mixtures. In the three years of the study a total of 2247 thrips individuals were collected on lupin plants at the full blooming stage (BBCH 65); 2237 belonging to 17 species, and 10 individuals, because of damage, were classified to the genus range. In each treatment Frankliniella intonsa and Aeolothrips intermedius were the dominant species. Thrills tabaci also occurred in great numbers on lupin plants.

J	"Hauggaard-Nielsen, H; Ambus, P; Jensen, ES"				"Hauggaard-Nielsen, H; Ambus, P; Jensen, ES"			Temporal and spatial distribution of roots and competition for nitrogen in pea-barley intercrops - a field study employing P-32 technique	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						"barley; field pea; nitrogen fixation; N-15 isotope dilution principle; P-32 methodology; root system dynamics"	"INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; YIELD; CEREALS; SOIL; SYSTEMS; TRAITS"	Root system dynamics, productivity and N use were studied in inter- and sole crops of field pea (Pisum sativum L.) and spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) on a temperate sandy loam. A P-32 tracer placed at a depth of 12.5, 37.5, 62.5 or 87.5 cm was employed to determine root system dynamics by sampling crop leaves at 0, 15, 30 and 45 cm lateral distance. N-15 addition was used to estimate N-2 fixation by pea, using sole cropped barley as reference crop. The Land Equivalent Ratio (LER), which is defined as the relative land area under sole crops that is required to produce the yields achieved in intercropping, were used to compare the crop growth in intercrops relative to the respective sole crops. The P-32 appearance in leaves revealed that the barley root system grows faster than that of pea. P uptake by the barley root system during early growth stages was approximately 10 days ahead of that of the pea root system in root depth and lateral root distribution. More than 90% of the P uptake by the pea root system was confined to the top 12.5 cm of soil, whereas barley had about 25-30% of tracer P uptake in the 12.5 - 62.5 cm soil layer. Judging from this P uptake, intercropping caused the barley root system to grow deeper and faster lateral root development of both species was observed. Barley accumulated similar amounts of aboveground N when grown as inter- and sole crop, whereas the total aboveground N acquired by pea in the intercrop was only 16% of that acquired in the pea sole crop. The percentage of total aboveground N derived from N-2 fixation in sole cropped pea increased from 40% to 80% during the growth period, whereas it was almost constant at 85% in intercropped pea. The total amounts of N-2 fixed were 95 and 15 kg N ha(-1) in sole cropped and intercropped pea, respectively. Barley was the dominant component of the pea-barley intercrop, obtaining 90% of its sole crop yield, while pea produced only 15% of the grains of a sole crop pea. Intercropping of pea and barley improved the utilization of plant growth resources (LER > 1) as compared to sole crops. Root system distribution in time and space can partly explain interspecific competition. The P-32 methodology proved to be a valuable tool for determining root dynamics in intercropping systems.

The use of relay-intercropped forage legumes may be a way of providing ecological services such as weed control, increasing N availability in the cropping system thanks to N fixation, reducing N leaching and supplying nitrogen to the following crop. However, these ecological services vary considerably depending on the forage legume biomass. The aim of this study was to identify factors that affect forage legume establishment and growth to help farmers adjust the management of the cover crop. Sixteen field experiments were conducted over a period of five years. In each experiment, winter wheat was grown as sole crop or intercropped with one of two species of forage legumes; Trifolium repens L. or Trifolium pratense L After the intercropping stage, the cover crop was maintained until the end of winter and then destroyed by plowing before maize was sown. Climatic conditions, and the accumulation of legume and weed biomass were monitored from when the legume was sown to destruction of the cover crop. Our results showed that a minimum threshold of about 500 kg ha(-1) biomass in the aboveground parts of the cover crop was needed at the end of intercropping to obtain the minimum biomass of 2000 kg ha-1 in September necessary to guarantee ecological services. To obtain sufficient legume biomass at the end of intercropping period, a thermal time greater than 1900 degrees Cd and more rainfall than 300 mm are required for legume growth. Moreover, a legume density of at least of 300 plants per square meter at the wheat flowering stage was a good indicator of legume biomass at the end of the intercropping period. Rainfall was a limiting factor of legume growth between the end of the intercropping period and September. Legume density at wheat flowering and climatic conditions during the intercropping period thus appear to be good indicators to predict to capacity of cover crop to produce sufficient biomass in September. These indicators can be used by farmers as a management tool for the cover crop. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The objectives were to evaluate the host range of the fungus and to determine mortality and dry-weight reductions of large crabgrass as influenced by concentrations of inoculum and Silwet L-77 (an organosilicone surfactant), post-inoculation dew temperature, and post-inoculation dew duration. In addition, control of large crabgrass growing in mixed stands with soybeans was evaluated. Ninety to 100% control of large crabgrass, as indicated by mortality and dry-weight reduction, was obtained when inoculum concentrations were greater than or equal to 1 X 10(6) conidia/ml, Silwet L-77 concentrations were greater than or equal to 0.1% (v/v), and dew periods were greater than or equal to 10h (20-35degreesC). Forty plant species in 10 families were screened against C intermedia in host-range studies. Species that exhibited mortality and/or significant dry-weight reductions due to fungal inoculations included: redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), beet (Beta vulgaris), chenopodium (Chenopodium amaranticolor), wild oat (Avena fatua), broadleaf signalgrass (Brachiaria platyphylla), bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon), large crabgrass, barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli), red rice (Oryza sp.), green foxtail (Setaria viridis), shattercane (Sorghum bicolor), johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense), one cultivar of grain sorghum (Sorghum vulgare), and two cultivars of corn (Zea mays). No mortality or significant dry-weight reductions were noted for peanut (Arachis hypogaea), soybean (Glycine max), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), centipedegrass (Eremochloa ophiuroides), St. Augustinegrass (Stenotaphrum secondatum), zoysiagrass (Zoysia sp.), or 23 other species. When C intermedia was applied to mixed plantings of soybeans and large crabgrass, 80-96% reductions in dry weight occurred for large crabgrass seedlings. No significant dry-weight reductions were observed for the soybean plants when compared to the control plants. These results indicate that C intermedia could be a potential microbial herbicide for control of large crabgrass in crops such as soybean, cotton, and peanut. Additional studies are needed to assess the potential for use of C intermedia for control of Digitaria spp. in turf grasses such as centipedegrass, zoysiagrass, and St. Augustinegrass that exhibited resistance to the fungus.

Host susceptibility was evaluated in accordance with a disease index, with the lesion length after stem inoculation, and with a root system disease index. Wild cherry was found to be highly susceptible to P. citrophthora, and was also found to be susceptible to P. alni, although to a lesser extent. Italian alder was very susceptible to P. alni, but had only low susceptibility to P. citrophthora. The other Phytophthora species caused only modest symptoms. The danger to alder and wild cherry is all the greater because these trees not only share the same pathogens, but also commonly planted together in mixed stands. The results will now have to be confirmed by using a more natural inoculation method.

J	"DAVIS, JHC; WOOLLEY, JN"				"DAVIS, JHC; WOOLLEY, JN"			GENOTYPIC REQUIREMENT FOR INTERCROPPING	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article								An important aspect of an intercropping system is the extent of competition between the crops. Where this is large, there is likely to be a significant genotypexcropping systems interaction. Even when the correlation between sole-crop and intercrop yields is positive, there may be significant departures from the trend which can be exploited by plant breeding. The traits required for intercropping are those which enhance the complementary effect between species. The setting of objectives must take into account not only the influence of a particular trait on the target crop's yield, but its potential effect on another crop. A useful strategy for areas with unreliable rainfall distribution is to intercrop a relatively short-duration crop with a long-season indeterminate crop, for which the periods of maximum demand on water resources are different. Photosensitivity provides a mechanism for timing precisely the flowering of particular cultivars. The plant types of the intercropped species should be selected to complement each other. Cultivars of species which are compatible in this way can be planted at higher density, and this is a major factor contributing to the ability of intercrops to yield more than sole crops. Plant breeding is costly. An intercropping system targeted for breeding must clearly be of major significance, cover a large area and be sufficiently unique to justify a separate programme. A cereal/legume intercrop in excess of 0. 5 million hectares is estimated to be sufficiently large to justify a full-scale crossing and selection programme. For adaptive variety trials bivariate analysis is the preferred approach, in order to remove background correlated effects between the two crop yields in an intercrop. An alternative is to select on the basis of income. Farmers, however, may use a wider range of criteria to select cultivars. The best way of accounting for these is to involve farmers in the selection process. Early generation selection in a breeding programme should first focus on the highly heritable traits identified as contributing to intercrop efficiency. Early generation yield evaluation of genotypes of beans intercropped with maize was found to be feasible and effective. Selection under farmers' own management should be introduced at as early a stage as possible, once a set of promising lines has been identified. Breeding for intercropping will be most effectively carried out in the context of regional collaboration or international programmes, focusing on improving and extending the use of cropping systems which are already widely practiced.

To advance the knowledge of belowground facilitative mechanisms involved in P-deficiency tolerance (root allocation, biochemical and microbial responses), soybean (Glycine max) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) were grown as monocrops and intercrops under P-deficiency and P-sufficiency conditions in soil-filled rhizoboxes. The hypothesis was that intercropping stimulates root microbial diversity, root biomass allocation and P-hydrolyzing acid phosphatases (APase) activity in roots under P-deficient conditions. Total root dry weight (RDW), length, and surface area significantly increased in P-deficient intercropped wheat and soybean. Greater root allocation to deeper soil layers was evident for P-deficient intercropped wheat. Shallow roots of intercropped wheat exhibited highly stimulated APase activity under P-deficient conditions while shallow roots of monocropped soybean exhibited higher APase activity in comparison to deeper roots, irrespective of P treatment. Root fungal diversity was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in intercropped wheat, and was significantly correlated with RDW, root APase activity, shoot P, and soil available P (rho = 0.24, p= 0.01). Root bacterial diversity was higher in both intercrops, and was significantly correlated with RDW and shoot N concentration. The observed shifts in root microbial diversity, root biomass allocation and APase activity provide explanatory mechanisms of relationships between rhizosphere heterogeneity and pathways for increased P acquisition in diversified crops. Advanced belowground metabolomics on root microbial communities are required to reveal the beneficial effect of root microorganisms in associations of different crop species.

In order to investigate the effects of planting method and proportions of planting on forage yield and growth indices in barley and broad leaf vetch mixture, this experiment was conducted during 2007-08 cropping season in Experimental Farm of Agricultural College of Shahid Chamran University, Ahvaz. The experiment was as split plots based on randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. Planting method had three levels (row intercropping, mixed intercropping and intercropping on row) as the main factors. Planting proportions had four levels (sole-cropping of barley and vetch, 2 to 1 proportion of barley to vetch and 1 to 2 proportion of barley to vetch) as the sub-factors. In order to make the mixtures, the replacement series technique was used. The results indicated that interaction effect of planting method and proportions of planting for dry forage yield of barley, vetch and total dry forage yield was significant. The maximum and minimum dry forage yield of barley belonged to pure stand of barley in row planting (1.3.99 t/ha) and 1 to 2 proportion of barley to vetch in row intercropping (8.09 t/ha), respectively. Maximum and minimum dry forage of vetch was obtained from sole cropping of vetch (8.24 t/ha) and 2 to 1 proportion of barley to vetch in row intercropping (2.51 t/ha), respectively. Maximum and minimum of total dry forage yield obtained from 1 to 2 proportion of barley to vetch in intercropping on row (18.35 t/ha) and pure stand of vetch in row planting (7.73 t/ha), respectively. The highest crop growth rate in barley was seen at 120 days after planting date and then decreased. 120 days after planting date, pure barley had more crop growth rate (CGR) but in the final growth stage, barley in intercropping had more CGR than the pure barley. At all growth stages of vetch, the CGR was higher in pure vetch, while at intercropping, the CGR of vetch was decreased. The relative growth rate (RGR) of barley and vetch showed decreasing trend over the time. At the end of growth stages, pure barley had lower RGR and pure vetch had a higher RGR, compared to other plant proportions.

This experiment was started to study the effects of WIC on soybean, in which two soybean genotypes ND12 and C103 were grown in pots with roots split equally between two soil column and six WIC treatments (%) T1 (100), T2, (100:50), T3 (100:20), T4 (50:50), T5 (50:20), and T6 (20:20) field capacity on both sides of soybean roots were used. Results showed that both genotypes responded significantly to WIC treatments for all the parameters; however, the level of response differed between genotypes. Maximum osmoprotectants (except proline), biomass, yield and yield-related traits and superior seed quality were observed with ND12. Among WIC treatments, T2 and T3 produced 94% and 85%, and 93% and 81% of T1 biomass and yield, respectively. Similarly, treatments T2 and T3 also improved the oil quality by maintaining the content of unsaturated fatty acids and isoflavone content, while opposite trends were observed for protein content. Overall, moderate water reduction (T2 and T3) can improve soybean seed-quality and by selecting drought-resistant genotypes we can increase the soybean yield under intercropping systems."

However, the knowledge of disease resistance via belowground root interactions in cereal/legume intercropping systems remains quite limited. Pot experiments were conducted to quantify the effect of root interactions by intercropped millet on peanut disease under conditions of full, partial and no root interactions based on TMT (tandem mass tag) labelling. Disease incidence and disease index were assessed at flowering stage and antioxidant enzymes in peanut leaves were analyzed. The results showed that root rot disease and leaf spot disease of peanut were alleviated by intercropped millet through root interspecific interactions from below-ground in the cereal/legume intercropping. The contents of chlorophyll and the nutrient contents of peanut were increased in peanut by root interactions, which indicated that the growth of peanut were improved. The number of bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes was increased by 57.3, 133 and 49.7% in peanut rhizosphere of full root interactions compared to the treatment without root interactions, respectively. There were 10 differentially expressed protein spots in intercropped peanut roots, which were involved in response to disease. The results showed that stress-response proteins displayed a differential expression levels in intercropped peanut, the disease resistance was improved via up-regulated proteins including class III acidic endochitinase, and down-regulated pectinesterase, and lipoxygenase etc. The results indicated that the intercropping root intermingling could contribute to the resistance to disease of intercropped species via improvement of nutrient acquisition and differential expressed stress-response proteins. The present study provides a new insight into plant disease control in cereal and legume intercropping by root interspecific interactions.

Co-cultivation of different species is anticipated to lead to vertical root niche differentiation and thus to higher soil nutrient depletion. Using a qPCR-based method we quantified root biomass distribution of four catch crop species in vertical soil profiles in pure vs. mixed stands. Pure stands of mustard and phacelia robustly reached 70 cm soil depth, while oat preferably colonized upper soil layers, and clover developed the shallowest and smallest root system. Analysis of residual nitrate pools in different soil depths and correlation with root biomass showed that, besides rooting depth also root biomass determines soil nitrogen depletion. While occupying the same vertical niches as in pure stands, mustard and phacelia dominated total root biomass of the mix. In contrast, root biomass of clover and oat was severely suppressed in presence of the other species. Below-ground biomass profiling indicated low niche complementarity among the root systems of the examined species. Nonetheless, the mixture mostly overyielded root biomass of the pure stands and thus shows higher potential for efficient soil exploration by roots.

The treatments were arranged in a 2 x 5 factorial laid out in randomized complete block design with three replications. Intercropping significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the yield of cassava and soybean compared with their sole crops. Horizontal method of planting cassava (P < 0.05) depressed yield and yield components of the crop species in the mixture. Soybean yields were generally low due to the shading effect of the cassava component in both cropping seasons. In 2001/2002 and 2002/2003, sowing soybean four weeks before cassava increased grain yield than when sown two weeks before, simultaneously, and two or four weeks after cassava planting. There was no interaction effect between cassava planting method and soybean sowing date in the two cropping seasons. Regardless of the cassava planting method used, soybean sown 4 or 2 weeks before cassava gave the highest monetary returns and net profit than soybean sown at any other time in the mixture or by growing the component crops separately.

J	"Sime, G; Aune, JB"				"Sime, Getachew; Aune, Jens B."			Sustainability of Improved Crop Varieties and Agricultural Practices: A Case Study in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia	AGRICULTURE-BASEL			English	Article						"technologies; rural livelihood; agricultural policy; extension system; semi-arid Ethiopia"	"CONSERVATION TILLAGE; SMALLHOLDER FARMERS; CLIMATE VARIABILITY; WATER CONSERVATION; SEMIARID REGION; LAND-USE; MAIZE; ADOPTION; SYSTEM; CHALLENGES"	Technological change has been the major driving force for increasing agricultural productivity and promoting agriculture development in developing countries. To improve the agricultural productivity and farmers' livelihoods, several agricultural technologies (improved crop varieties and related agricultural practices) were introduced by various agencies to the farmers in the Rift Valley of Ethiopia. Thus, the objective of this study is to identify these technologies, and evaluate their characteristics and sustainability. The data were collected from farmers, agricultural extension workers, and agricultural experts, through a series of focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and farm observations, selected through purposive and random sampling techniques. Results showed that extension systems, social networks, or research projects were the agencies that introduced the technologies to the farmers. Haricot beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and early and mid-maturing maize (Zea mays L.), as well as agricultural practices like row-sowing, banding fertilizer application, intercropping, and traditional rainwater-harvesting, were found to be in continuous use by the farmers. In contrast, the use of extra-early-maturing maize, sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) and finger millet (Eleusine coracana L.), as well as the use of related practices, including harvesting maize at physiological maturity, seed priming and fertilizer microdosing, were the technologies that were discontinued at the time of pursuing this study. Most of the continuing technologies had a high potential for reducing the vulnerability of the rain-fed agriculture to rainfall variability. Regardless of sources, the national extension system supported technologies that were integrated into the system only. Most of the discontinued technologies were found to be introduced by the research projects. These technologies were not brought into the attention of policy-makers for their integration into the extension system. The farmers also disliked a few of them for unfitting the existing socioeconomic setting. Whereas, the technologies that were introduced by the social networks were found to be widely used by the farmers, though they were not supported by the extension system. This is because most such technologies offer better yield and income. For instance, social networks have popularized haricot beans and hybrid maize because of their higher benefits to farmers. Farmers consider both socioeconomic and agroecological conditions for selecting and using technologies, whereas the extension system centers on existing agroecological conditions for recommending and supporting agricultural technologies. Consideration of both socioeconomic and agroecological settings would increase the prospect of a technology for sustainable adoption. Overall, rainfall variability, high price and poor access to improved seeds, farmers' poor economic conditions, and the inadequate linkage between extension systems, social networks and research projects, remain critical factors influencing the sustainable use of agricultural technologies. It is, thus, commendable that policymakers should consider local socioeconomic and agroecological settings in recommending and supporting agricultural technologies besides instituting a strong consortium of extension systems, research institutes, research projects,social networks and farmers for improved agricultural technology development, extension system and sustainable adoption.

Wheat is also a very common crop traditionally planted in fall or spring and harvested in summer year by year. This continuous cropping system exhibited the disadvantages of reducing the fertility of soil through decreasing microbial diversity. Thus, management of microbial diversity in the rhizosphere plays a vital role in sustainable crop production. In this study, ten common spring crops in north China were chosen sole-cropped and four were chosen intercropped with peanut in wheat fields after harvest. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and DNA sequencing of one 16S rDNA fragment were used to analyze the bacterial diversity and species identification. DGGE profiles showed the bacterial community diversity in rhizosphere soil samples varied among various crops under different cropping systems, more diverse under intercropping system than under sole-cropping. Some intercropping-specific bands in DGGE profiles suggested that several bacterial species were stimulated by intercropping systems specifically. Furthermore, the identification of these dominant and functional bacteria by DNA sequencing indicated that intercropping systems are more beneficial to improve soil fertility. Compared to intercropping systems, we also observed changes in microbial community of rhizosphere soil under sole-crops. The rhizosphere bacterial community structure in spring crops showed a strong crop species-specific pattern. More importantly, Empedobacter brevis, a typical plant pathogen, was only found in the carrot rhizosphere, suggesting carrot should be sown prudently. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that crop species and cropping systems had significant effects on bacterial community diversity in the rhizosphere soils. We strongly suggest sorghum, glutinous millet and buckwheat could be taken into account as intercropping crops with peanut; while hulled oat, mung bean or foxtail millet could be considered for sowing in wheat fields after harvest in North China."

Treatment T1 (maize as border crop and coriander as intercrop) harbored the smallest cumulative mean leafhopper population (6.90 insects per 3 leaves per plant) and the next to smallest mean whitefly population (9.64 insects per 3 leaves per plant) during monsoon season of 2010 and 2011. Treatment T3 (maize as border crop and marigold as intercrop) was second best in reducing the leafhopper population (7.27 insects per 3 leaves per plant), while it was the best treatment in reducing the whitefly population (8.36 insects per 3 leaves per plant). The sole crop (T7) harbored the largest whitefly (20.17 insects per 3 leaves per plant) and leafhopper (12.61 insects per 3 leaves per plant) populations among the 7 treatments. The lowest mean percentage fruit infestation was recorded from treatment T1 (by number: 27.72; by weight: 27.81). All the treatments involving intercrops showed significantly lower percentage fruit infestation by L. orbonalis than eggplant alone (T7, control), which showed 37.73% infestation by number of fruits and 38.13% by weight of the fruits. The greatest mean number of coccinellids (1.25 per plant) and largest Shannon-Wiener indices were recorded from treatment T1 (maize and coriander). The smallest mean number of coccinellids (0.37 per plant) and smallest Shannon-Wiener indices were recorded from the sole crop control, T7. Various plant volatiles present in the intercrop were identified by the thermal desorption technique. Twenty one volatile compounds were present in coriander, 7 in marigold, and 18 in mint. The current state of knowledge of the behavioral effects (repellency, attractancy, no effect) of each chemical with respect the various herbivorous insects and natural enemies is summarized and this information will facilitate quantitative studies on how different pest and beneficial insects respond to plant volatiles in polycultures."

Sustainability Estimation of Oat:Pea Intercrops from the Agricultural Life Cycle Assessment Perspective	AGRONOMY-BASEL			English	Article						"LCA; intercrops; Avena sativa L; Pisum sativum L; attributional approach; land demand"	"GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; PEA-WHEAT INTERCROPS; NITROGEN; PESTICIDES"	Winter cereal:legume intercropping is considered a sustainable arable farming system not only in temperate regions but also in Mediterranean environments. Previous studies have shown that with suitable crop stand composition, high grain yield can be achieved. In this study, a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the influence of sowing ratio and nitrogen (N) fertilization on grain nitrogen yield of oat (Avena sativa L.) and pea (Pisum sativum L.) in intercrops was performed to find the optimal design to achieve low environmental impact. This study compared the environmental impact of oat:pea intercrops using agricultural LCA. Monocrops of oat and pea and substitutive intercrops, which were fertilized with different levels of N, were compared. The system boundaries included all the processes from cradle to farm gate. Mass-based (grain N yield) and area-based (land demand for generating the same grain N yield) functional units were used. The results covered the impact categories related to the agricultural LCAs. The ReCiPe 2016 Midpoint and Endpoint characterization model was used for the data expression. According to the results, an unfertilized combination of oat and pea (50%:50%) had the lowest environmental impact in comparison with the other 14 assessed variants and selected impact categories. In the assessed framework, pea monocrops or intensively fertilized oat monocrops can also be considered as alternatives with relatively low impact on the environment. However, an appropriate grain N yield must be reached to balance the environmental impact resulting from the fertilizer inputs. The production and use of fertilizers had the greatest impact on the environment within the impact categories climate change, eutrophication, and ecotoxicity. The results indicated that high fertilizer inputs did not necessarily cause the highest environmental impact. In this respect, the achieved grain N yield level, the choice of allocation approach, the functional unit, and the data expression approach played dominant roles.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the nutritional characteristics of silages and the yield and milk quality of Holstein cows fed triticale silages in monoculture or intercropped with either oats or legumes. The crops for silage production were triticale (TS), triticale in consortium with forage pea (TSP), and triticale in consortium with oats, forage peas and vetches (TSOPV). The silages showed no differences in dry matter content. The highest crude protein (13.06 %) and ethereal extract content was observed in TSOPV, but in the case of the latter, there was little difference when compared with TS (2.35 and 2.16 %, respectively) although the ash contents of the TSOPV and TSP silages did present a difference compared to TS silage. The neutral and acid detergent fibers (NDF and ADF) and cellulose fractions of TS silage were higher (68.60, 41.46 and 38.19 %, respectively) than those in TSOPV and TSP silages, which also had higher levels of soluble nitrogen, ethanol and acetic acid. Dry matter intake was higher in both TSOPV and TSP, which also provided a higher milk yield (21.19 and 20.45 L cow d(-1)) compared to that of TS silage (18.74 L cow d(-1)). Cows fed TS also produced milk with a lower N-ureic content (15.15 mg dL(-1)). The inclusion of legumes with triticale provided good fermentative quality for silage and increased milk production of cows without altering their concentrations of fat and protein.

The objectives were to compare the effects of these organic fertilizer and cropping system in organic farming on (a) yield of peas and oats, grown as the sole crop or intercropped, as well as N-2 fixation and photosynthetic rates, (b) the yield of wheat as a succeeding crop, (c) microbial biomass indices in soil and roots, and (d) microbial activity estimated by the CO2 evolution rate in the field and the amount of organic fertilizers, recovered as particulate organic matter (POM). In general, organic fertilizer application improved nodule dry weight (DW), photosynthetic rates, N-2 fixation, and N accumulation of peas as well as N concentration in oat grain. Averaged across fertilizer treatments, pea/oat intercropping significantly decreased nodule DW, N-2 fixation and photosynthetic rate of peas by 14, 17, and 12%, respectively, and significantly increased the photosynthetic rate of oats by 20%. However, the land equivalent ratio (LER) of intercropped peas and oats exceeded 1.0, indicating a yield advantage over sole cropping. Soil microbial biomass was positively correlated with pea dry matter yields both in sole and intercropped systems. Organic fertilizers increased the contents of microbial biomass C, N, P, and fungal ergosterol in soil and CO2 production, whereas the cropping system had no effects on these microbial indices. According to the organic fertilizer recovered as POM, 70% (manure) and 64% (compost) of added C were decomposed, but only 39% (manure) and 13% (compost) could be attributed to CO2-C during a 101-day period. This indicated that horse manure was more readily available to soil microorganisms than compost, leading to increased grain yields of the succeeding winter wheat. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The study was aimed to examine the development of diseases in pea/spring cereal intercrops in the organic farming conditions. The experiment was carried out in 2007 at the Lithuanian Institute of Agriculture in Dotnuva on a loamy Endocalcari-Ephypogleyic Cambisol. Peas (Pisum sativum L.) and spring cereals: wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), oats (Avena sativa L.), and triticale (x Triticosecale Wittm.) were sown as intercrops or mono crops for grain. Powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis), rust (Puccinia spp.), leaf blotch (Pyrenophora avenae), net blotch (Pyrenophora teres), tan spot (Pyrenophora tritici-repentis), septoria leaf blotch (Septoria spp.), and head blight (Fusarium spp.) were identified and assessed in the intercrops and mono crops. In many cases, the diseases developed intensively during grain formation stage. Cultivation of spring cereals in mixtures with peas did not have any exceptionally marked effect on the occurrence of diseases, since the trends of reduction of the severity of individual diseases were not always consistent. The grain yield of spring cereals was higher when they had been grown as mono crops compared with pea/cereal intercrops.

E. Smith), is an early season production constraint of sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench, and maize, Zea mays L., in Central America. Because fall armyworm populations decline after a brief buidup on landrace sorghum, this study was conducted to determine whether antibiosis was a mechanism of resistance. Three fall armyworm feeding experiments were conducted in the laboratory using whorl-leaf material collected daily from sorghum. Experiments began with neonate larvae once plants had lived for 30-40 d. Mortality, pupal weight, generation time, intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)), and relative fitness were used to make inferences about antibiosis. Experiment 1 determined that the moderately resistant check, 1821 c.m. (r(m) = 0.31), was comparable to the susceptible check, 'Huerin Inta' (r(m) = 0.30), thus indicating that its mechanism of resistance was probably larval nonpreference. However, landrace San Bernardo III (r(m) = 0.27) significantly suppressed fall armyworm population density increase. Experiment 2 confirmed resistance in landrace San Bernardo III and showed that its resistance could be combined with that of inbred line TAM428 to produce an enhanced level of antibiosis. The mechanism of resistance in 'AF28' also was shown to be antibiosis. Experiment 3 indicated that antibiosis may be widespread in landrace populations and that it was manifested differently than in 'AF28'. Cohorts raised on three landrace accessions attained significantly lower pupal weights (184-191 mg/larva-1) than those raised on 'AF28' (216 mg/larva-1). They also suffered significantly higher mortality on 'AF28' (42%) than those raised on landrace populations (16-30%). Antibiosis was detected in the landrace accessions San Bernardo III, Hilate-179, Pina-61, and Lerdo-104. A hypothesis, based on differential selection and increased selection pressure brought about through intercropping with maize, is presented to explain the development of antibiosis in these landrace populations.

The randomized complete block design was applied in field condi-tions in 2015???2017. It comprised one factor, the timing and the intensity of post-emergence weed harrowing with the spring-tine harrow. The plots were harrowed once, twice, or three times on one day at six consecutive growth stages of triticale: BBCH 10, 11, 12, 13, 21, 22. Harrowing did not increase the grain yield of the triticale-lupin mix -ture, and when repeated three times at BBCH 21, it decreased the grain yield. The cereal was more resistant than lupin to timing and intensity of harrowing. The weeds were best controlled by a single cultivation conducted at the first leaf of triticale. This method caused a significant reduction in the density and the biomass of weeds at the anthesis of triticale and a reduction in the weed biomass at the full maturity of the mixture. Increasing intensity of harrowing by repeating cultivations had relatively weak influence on the weeds.

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite information (sigma degrees (VH/VV)) was provided by the Sentinel-1A (S1-A) mission through two orbits (30 and 132), with a repetitiveness of six days. The optical data were obtained from the Landsat-8 mission. SAR and optical data were acquired over one complete agricultural season, in 2016, over a test site located in the southwest of France. The results show that the total dry masses of corn can be estimated accurately (R-2 = 0.92) at daily time steps due to a combination of satellite and model data. The SAR data are more suitable for characterizing the first period of crop development (until the end of flowering), whereas the optical data can be used throughout the crop cycle. Moreover, the model offers good performances in plant (R-2 = 0.90) and ear (R-2 = 0.93) mass retrieval, irrespective of the phenological stage. The results also reveal that four phenological stages (four to five leaves, flowering, ripening, and harvest) can be accurately predicted by the proposed approach (R-2 = 0.98; root-mean-square error (RMSE) = seven days). Nevertheless, some important points must be taken into account before assimilation, namely the SAR signal must be corrected with respect to thermal noise before being assimilated, and the relationship estimated between the GAI and SAR signal must be performed over fields cultivated without intercrops. These results are unique in the literature and provide a new way to better monitor corn production over time."

Modelling species competition in mixtures of perennial sow-thistle and spring barley based on shoot radiation use efficiency	ACTA AGRICULTURAE SCANDINAVICA SECTION B-SOIL AND PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						"Competition; Hordeum distichon L.; LAI; parameterization; perennial weed; radiation allocation; RUE; Sonchus arvensis L.; temperature sum"	"WEED FLORA; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; ECOPHYSIOLOGICAL MODEL; BIOMASS ALLOCATION; SIMULATION-MODEL; COMMON RAGWEED; GROWTH; CROP; NITROGEN; YIELD"	Perennial sow-thistle (Sonchus arvensis L.) may be a serious weed in organic and conventional farming. To assess the effects of radiation acquisition and resource allocation on competitive ability, S. arvensis was grown together with spring barley (Hordeum distichon L.) in six mixtures in a replacement series with initial above-ground biomass proportions of S. arvensis ranging from 2% to 96%. A one-season experiment was made outdoors in boxes in Uppsala, Sweden, at a low level of nitrogen supply (5 g N m(-2)). The study tested the predictability of shoot biomass of each species based on two principal assumptions: (i) growth model parameters derived from species in monocultures could be applied in mixtures, and (ii) radiation in the mixed stand was partitioned between species proportional to their leaf area. Calibration of two parameters, for scaling of shoot radiation use efficiency and radiation partitioning respectively, were the base for the evaluation. When the coefficients were close to unity, which was the case for all mixtures dominated by barley, and for one of the mixtures with high proportion of S. arvensis in the early season, observed and predicted shoot biomass coincided well. For the evenly composed mixtures, total shoot biomass was underestimated (the scaling coefficient of shoot radiation use efficiency was > 1), whereas the relative composition among species was predicted well. In the late season the principal model assumptions were not applicable to S. arvensis, likely due to increasing root allocation not accounted for in the model. Sonchus arvensis in mixtures with high proportions was planted early in relation to sowing of barley, which resulted in a comparably late development stage of S. arvensis. Consequently the relation between species development stages varied with species composition suggesting a need to introduce effects of differences in development stage into the model.

We use system dynamics modeling to combine data from field experiments, crop modeling and choice experiments to explore the potential for adoption and diffusion of a sustainable agriculture technology in a risky environment with high variability in annual rainfall: the perennial management of pigeonpea in maize-based systems of Malawi. Production estimates from a crop model for the annual intercrop system and data from field experiments on ratooning for the perennial system provided the information to create a stochastic production model. Data from choice experiments posed by a farmer survey conducted in three Malawi districts provide the information for parameters on farmers' preferences for the attributes of the perennial system. The perennial pigeonpea technology appeared clearly superior in scenarios where average values for maize yield and pigeonpea biomass production were held constant. Adoption was fastest in scenarios where relatively dry growing seasons showcased the benefits of the perennial system, suggesting that perennial management may be appropriate in marginal locations. The potential for adoption was reduced greatly when stochasticity in yields and seasons combine with significant social pressure to conform. The mechanism for this is that low yields suppress adoption and increase disadoption due to the dynamics of trust in the technology. This finding is not unique to perennial pigeonpea, but suggests that a critical factor in explaining low adoption rates of any new agricultural technology is the stochasticity in a technology's performance. Understanding how that stochasticity interacts with the social dynamics of learning skills and communicating trust is a critical feature for the successful deployment of sustainable agricultural technologies, and a novel finding of our study.

Although facilitative effects of having legume neighbours (focus on yield productivity) are well studied, a better mechanistic understanding of how legumes interact with non-legumes in terms of root distribution is needed. We tested the effects of neighbour identity, its spatial location, as well as the effects of plant order of arrival on above and belowground traits and root distribution. We performed a rhizotron experiment (4 weeks duration) in which we grew maize alone, with only a legume, only another grass, or with both species and tracked roots of the plant species using green and red fluorescent markers. Maize grew differently when it had a neighbour, with reduced development when growing with wheat compared to alone. Growing with a legume generally equated to the same outcome as not having a neighbour. Roots grew towards the legume species and away from the wheat. Order of arrival affected aboveground traits to a certain extent, but its effects on maize roots were dependent on spatial location. Our study provides evidence of facilitation, showing the importance of the identity of the neighbours, together with their spatial location, and how order of arrival can modulate the outcome of these initial interactions.

In this study, we adopted soybean flax ridge-furrow intercropping system in order to constrain soybean's excessive vegetative growth by interspecific competition between intercrops and estimated the growth, photosynthesis and yield of soybean. Two-year-experiment was conducted in 2018 and 2019 in the experimental farm of KIM IL SUNG University. Soybean seeds were grown in ridges and flax seeds were in furrows between ridges. During the co-growth stage, the early growth of soybean intercropped with flax was depressed by interspecific competition. At 45 days after soybean sowing, just before flax harvest, the average height and stem diameter of intercropped soybean plant were 22.5 cm and 0.7 mm shorter than those of sole cropped soybean plant, respectively. At the reproductive growth stage, the height of intercropped soybean plant was still 18.5 cm shorter than sole cropped soybean, while other agronomic parameters, including leaf area index (LAI), dry matter per plant, photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll contents, were greater for intercropped soybean. This led to higher yield of soybean (118.5%) and land equivalent ratio (LER) (203.5%) in ridge-furrow intercropping, as compared to sole cropping. Our results suggest that ridge-furrow intercropping system can be an effective way to constrain soybean's excessive vegetative growth during the rainy season and improve soybean seed yield and LER.

Because of the high clay content (40-60% or more), high bulk density (1.5-1.8 Mg m(-3)) and related properties, these soils have high moisture storage capacity. Conversely, these soils become very hard when dry and very sticky when wet. Since last two decades, scientists, farmers and also the policy makers have been striving to manage these soils through harnessing the beneficial attributes as well as overcoming the production constraints. Some of the potential options are efficient surface land configuration and crop diversification. Field experiments were conducted at the Research Farm at Bhopal to evaluate the land surface configuration and crop diversification. Results of our experiment on vertisols showed a considerable reduction in run off of water and also soil loss from broad-bed and furrow (BBF) compared to flat-on-grade (FOG) during rainy season and at the same time crop productivity was significantly improved in BBF. It enhanced yield of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), maize (Zea mays L.), pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.) as sole and as well as intercropping and sole chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) by about 12.7-20.0% over FOG. The yield of crops (soybean, maize and pigeonpea), expressed as soybean equivalent yield, was compared and it showed an improvement in yield from different intercropping systems on BBF. The residual effect of rainy season crops on succeeding chickpea was not significant; however, its yield in two irrigation (one pre-sowing plus one post-sowing) was significantly greater than pre-sowing irrigation only in both land configurations. Water use efficiency (WUE) of chickpea was more under BBF than FOG. The study elucidates the constraints and potentials of vertisol for crop production especially with reference to central India and effective ways to improve crop productivity through land surface modification and crop diversification."

In most intercropping studies, little attention has been paid to belowground interaction and nutrient management other than N while assessing yield advantage. In a 5-yr field experiment (2000-2004), we evaluated the impact of fertilizer and organic manures on below- and aboveground interaction, competitive ability, and economic viability of this intercropping at the Indian Institute of Soil Science, Bhopal for deep Vertisol (isohyperthermic Typic Haplustert) of central India. Above-and belowground growth components as well as biological activities were greatly improved in intercropped sorghum while the value of these except nitrate reductase (NR) activity, soil microbial biomass C (SMBC), and dehydrogenase activity (DHA) were reduced in intercropped soybean indicating interspecies competition between component crops. The increased NR activity, SMBC, and DHA in intercropped soybean revealed interspecies facilitation between the component crops. This showed that interspecies competition concurred with interspecies facilitation in this system. We observed that yield and land equivalent ratio (LER) of both the intercrops increased over sole crops though based on aggressivity and relative crowding coefficient (RCC), sorghum (+) is more competitive than soybean. Interaction of yield with different components indicated that three belowground components, i.e., NR activity in root (r = 0.62, r = 0.63, P < 0.05), root length density (r = 0.36, r = 0.33, P < 0.05), and SMBC (r = 0.71, r = 0.66, P < 0.05) of both intercrop soybean and intercrop sorghum, respectively, had the greater effect on yield advantage in the intercropping system. Soybean did not benefit from intercropping to the same degree as sorghum under N-P-K. Nutrient application influenced LER, RCC, and monetary advantage index and was found in the order of N-P-K plus farmyard manure (FYM) > N-P-K plus poultry manure (PM) > N-P-K plus phosphocompost (PC) > N-P-K > control. However, based on competition ratio, yield advantage was greater under N-P-K plus PM. The results suggest that sorghum is the major contributor to the mixture yield and that the integrated use of N-P-K plus FYM or N-P-K plus PM is an important nutrient management option for sustaining this intercropping system, particularly to benefit the legume component.

Applying of the labeled N-15 to a microplot within a larger plot can reduce the cost. The objective of this study was to assess microplot dimensions required to produce reliable N-15 data and cropping system effects on corn N-15 uptake under a regime of monocropped corn (Zea mays L.) and corn intercropped with annual Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.). Nitrogen was applied to large plots (15 by 75 m) at 270 kg N ha(-1) on a fine, silty, mixed, nonacid, frigid Typic Humaquept soil during the 1993 and 1994 growing seasons. Enriched N fertilizer was applied to 1.15- by 1-m(2) confined microplots located in opposite halves of I:he large plot in each year of the study. Corn plants inside the confined microplots were sampled at 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 m from the end borders of each microplot. In 1993, monocropping resulted in increases in leaf, stalk, and total dry matter production of 22, 41, and 30%, respectively, within microplots and relative to intercropped corn, There were no cropping system effects for these parameters in 1994. Monocropping increased atom % N-15 enrichment in corn grain and stalks and increased fertilizer N recovery in all plant tissue compared with intercropping in both years. There were no differences in atom % N-15 enrichment and fertilizer N recovery for plants harvested at the three sampling positions. These results suggest that a confined microplot with an area as small as 0.4 by 1.15 m can provide a reliable measure of fertilizer N recovery for corn plants in monocrop or intercrop systems. Any or all of the five plants within the microplot could be used to supply a reliable estimation of N-15 recovery by corn plants.

Optimal defoliation management of brachiaria grass-forage peanut for balanced pasture establishment	GRASS AND FORAGE SCIENCE			English	Article						"Arachis pintoi; Brachiaria; palisade grass; pasture establishment; warm-season legume"	"GRAZING MANAGEMENT; LIGHT INTERCEPTION; HERBAGE GROWTH; LEAF-AREA; LEGUME; SENESCENCE; MIXTURES; SWARDS; WHITE; RATES"	A well-established canopy is crucial for a stable mixed grass-legume forage pasture. The aim of this study was to assess a defoliation intensity that can ensure the establishment of mixed pasture of brachiaria grass (Brachiaria brizantha) intercropped with forage peanut (Arachis pintoi). The treatments comprised four canopy heights: 10, 20, 30 and 40 cm, maintained throughout the first 3 years of pasture establishment. Canopy structure, morphogenetic and structural characteristics were measured. A block design was used with four replicates, and seasons of the year were considered using repeated measurements over time. Light interception during the experimental period was 86.3%, 95.9%, 97.6%, and 99.1% for 10, 20, 30 and 40 cm of defoliation respectively (p < .001). Competition for light in taller canopies (at 30 and 40 cm) caused etiolation of forage peanut (greater internode, petiolate and stolon lengths). This response promoted its upward growth, leading to a lower stolon density compared with 10 and 20 cm. The treatment at 10 cm displayed a predominance of forage peanut (up to 0.614), potentially compromising community stability. Overall, the 20 cm canopy height showed a desired botanical composition (from 0.20 to 0.45 of legume in forage mass) and thus was considered an ideal defoliation intensity for establishment of mixed canopies of brachiaria grass and forage peanut.

Longitudinal analysis of a long-term conservation agriculture experiment in Malawi and lessons for future experimental design	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article						"Climate-smart agriculture; Diversification; El Nino; Malawi; Sustainable intensification; Zero-tillage"	"CLIMATE-CHANGE; MAIZE; SYSTEMS; ADAPTATION; STRESS; APPROXIMATION; ENVIRONMENTS; PRODUCTIVITY; CHALLENGES; MITIGATION"	Resilient cropping systems are required to achieve food security in the presence of climate change, and so several long-term conservation agriculture (CA) trials have been established in southern Africa - one of them at the Chitedze Agriculture Research Station in Malawi in 2007. The present study focused on a longitudinal analysis of 10 years of data from the trial to better understand the joint effects of variations between the seasons and particular contrasts among treatments on yield of maize. Of further interest was the variability of treatment responses in time and space and the implications for design of future trials with adequate statistical power. The analysis shows treatment differences of the mean effect which vary according to cropping season. There was a strong treatment effect between rotational treatments and other treatments and a weak effect between intercropping and monocropping. There was no evidence for an overall advantage of systems where residues are retained (in combination with direct seeding or planting basins) over conventional management with respect to maize yield. A season effect was evident although the strong benefit of rotation in El Nino season was also reduced, highlighting the strong interaction between treatment and climatic conditions. The power analysis shows that treatment effects of practically significant magnitude may be unlikely to be detected with just four replicates, as at Chitedze, under either a simple randomised control trial or a factorial experiment. Given logistical and financial constraints, it is important to design trials with fewer treatments but more replicates to gain enough statistical power and to pay attention to the selection of treatments to given an informative outcome.

When peanut was used as the N-15 donor plant, the atom % N-15 in the rice shoot was consistently higher than in control rice, indicating that N-15 transfer from peanut to the associated rice crop occurred. The percentage of N transfer (%NT) from peanut to the associated rice was 9.9%, 5.7% and 4.2% at the three N application rates, respectively. The N transferred from peanut to rice was 22.6, 15.5 and 8.2 mg N plant(-1), accounting for 10.9%, 6.4% and 3.1% of the total N accumulated in rice plants at the three N application rates, respectively. When rice functioned as the N-15 donor plant, the %NTs were 4.4%, 2.1% and 1.4% and represented about 5.2%, 3.4% and 2.4% of total N accumulated in peanut shoot at the three N application rates, respectively. The net directional N transfer was from peanut to rice and this was calculated by the difference in the bi-directional transfers and was mainly due to peanut root decomposition. Thus, the %NTs were 10.7%, 6.3%, 5.1% and 3.5% on 28 July (the day on which peanut shoots were cut), 8 August, 28 August and 8 September, respectively, and correspondingly, the N transferred from peanut to rice represented 6.0%, 5.8%, 5.1% and 3.2% of the total N accumulated in the rice plants.

The study site was managed conventionally and was of medium to high soil fertility for macronutrients. Land Equivalent Ratios (LER's) up 1.4 were achieved, suggesting up to a 40% grain yield increase for intercrops compared with sole crops. A comparison of winter and spring drilled wheat and bean intercrops indicated different key morphological and management factors. For the winter wheat, relative plant height was crucial. The older and taller cultivar Maris Widgeon grew better than the shorter Mercia in intercrops with the tall winter bran cultivar Bourdon. For the spring wheat and bean trials, weed competition resulted in the better performance of the wheat cultivar Canon than the bean cultivar Victor. Weed infestation in the spring intercrops was so high that its early and effective management was considered a key factor in their successful management. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, few studies evaluate the overall effect of cover crop (CC) on agricultural ecosystem functioning, and it is necessary to ensure that advantages of CC are not compensated by potential negative effects such as soil salinization. To improve the understanding of these complex processes, the authors analyzed water, nitrogen, and salinity dynamics in a maize cropping system with CC (vetch, barley, and fallow treatment), which was introduced in the intercropping season using both an experimental and modeling approach. As compared with a control treatment, the CC reduced nitrate leaching (64% for the barley treatment and 29% for the vetch treatment) without increasing soil salinity. In addition, the CC reduced the top layer salinity when maize was sown. Although the CC reduced with respect to fallow the net salt losses, in these conditions, excessive irrigation to favor salt leaching was not needed and, therefore, deep-water contamination risk with nitrate was reduced.

This study aimed at investigating the effect of sowing and fertilizer management on the performance of a winter pea (Pisum sativum L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) intercrop. A 2-yr experiment was performed in Grignon, France. Intercrop management strategies varied in sowing proportion relative to the sowing density of sole crops (50:50, 66:33, and 50:70 for pea and wheat, respectively) and N fertilization (without N fertilization, conventionally fertilized, and overfertilized at different dates). Conventionally managed sole wheat and sole pea were used as controls. The total grain yield, wheat yield proportion at harvest, yield components, N efficiency, grain protein concentration, residual soil mineral N aft er harvest, and land equivalent ratios (LER) were compared. The fertilized 50:50 intercrop was a good compromise between production (yields and wheat protein concentration), N efficiency, and limited residual soil N. The unfertilized 50:50 intercrop had the lowest grain yields and wheat protein concentration. An early overfertilization increased the proportion of wheat yield at harvest, whereas a late overfertilization increased the wheat grain protein concentration. Increasing the proportion of pea at sowing was a good way to produce more pea yield. Increasing the sown wheat proportion with N fertilization led to a higher proportion of wheat yield at harvest but did not improve the wheat grain protein concentration. These results indicate that agronomic management markedly impacts intercrop performance, and management practices can be adjusted to meet farmers' production targets.

Increased cutting frequency lowered the total dry matter yields of all plant species. Production of timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and smooth brome grass (Bromus inermis L.) swards was significantly reduced by taking four or five cuts instead of one or two cuts. Meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.) and meadow grass (Pea pratensis L.) showed only a minor interaction with harvesting regimes and were less affected by the cutting frequency. The increased cutting frequency raised the crude protein content, this causing the highest protein yields despite the smaller dry matter yields. The inclusion of red clover in seed mixtures had a favourable effect on the crude protein content of grass swards. Stands of sown plants decreased and the proportion of weeds in yields increased with time, reflecting the suitability of plant species to various cutting regimes. Meadow fescue and meadow grass with rapid regrowth had a positive effect on sward density and also caused less invasion of weeds when the cutting frequency was increased.

This study evaluated biomass production, N content, radiation interception (RI), and radiation use efficiency (RUE) of pea (Pisum sativum L.), oat (Avena sativa L.), and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) mixtures. Treatments were a three-way factorial of pea genotype ('Century' vs. 'Tipu'), pea planting density (90 vs. 224 kg ha(-1)), and cropping mixture (sole-cropped pea vs. pea planted with a mixture of oat and hairy vetch). A mixture of oat and vetch without pea was also planted. Treatments were planted in early June on a Caribou gravelly loam (coarse-loamy, mixed, frigid Typic Haplorthods) in Presque Isle, ME, in 1993 and 1994. Biomass production and radiation interception were measured by repeated sampling. Mixture biomass was affected by a year x pea density interaction: respective yields for mixtures containing low-density and high-density pea were 770 and 880 g m(-2) in 1993 vs. 820 and 730 g m(-2) in 1994. Mixture N content paralleled biomass production and averaged 20.9 g m(-2) across all treatments. While pea sole crops did not consistently produce biomass or N equal to three-species mixtures, the two-species mixture of oat and vetch did, yielding 820 g m(-2) of biomass and 21.7 g m(-2) of N, averaged over the 2 yr. Multiple regression showed that 61% of the variability in mixture biomass production was accounted for by a combination of early-season pea RI and midseason total mixture RUE.

The objective of this study was to identify and quantify the main weeds found in beans, maize and soybean cultivated in no-tillage and conventional systems. The experimental design was a randomized block one, with four replications. Experiments were conducted during three consecutive years, with summer crop (bean, maize and soybean) treatments, no-tillage system (NTS) composed by the covers, black oat, vetch and forage radish, in addition to their intercrop. In the conventional planting system (CTS), the area was left fallow in the off-season. The shoot dry matter of the covers was evaluated in each crop. The evaluated variables were: frequency, density, abundance, dry matter and the importance value index of the species in the area. Eighteen species of weeds and 12 families were identified, with Asteraceae and Poaceac families showing the highest number of individuals. The shoot dry matter production presented a difference among the covers; the cover black oat alone and intercrop with radish and vetch stood out, with the highest averages in the 3 years of the experiments. Cropping systems and different cover crops within the no-tillage system interfered in the number of encontered species. The emergence of Euphorbia heterophylla was favored, while the emergence of Lolium muftiflorum was inhibited. E. heterophylla was the most encountered in the NTS areas, and its germination was negatively influenced by soil mobilization. The intercrop of black oat and vetch provided maximum weed control in soybean."	"[Forte, C. T.; Galon, L.; Reichert, Jr F. W.; Menegat, A. D.; Perin, G. F.] UFFS, Erechim, RS, Brazil; [Beutler, A.

Tiller size/density compensation in temperate climate grasses grown in monoculture or in intercropping systems under intermittent grazing	GRASS AND FORAGE SCIENCE			English	Article						"Avena strigosa; Lolium multiflorum; mixture; plant community; self-thinning"	"RYEGRASS; PASTURE; DENSITY; NUMBER; WATER; OAT"	Oat and ryegrass intercropping in pastures is widely used in regions with subtropical climates. The aim of this study was to evaluate the tiller size/density compensation mechanisms in monoculture and intercropping swards of black oats (Avena strigosa Schreb cv. IAPAR 61) and annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam. cv common) under intermittent grazing. Treatments (black oat, annual ryegrass and their mixture) were assigned according to a complete randomized block design with four replicates. Ryegrass, oat and intercropped pastures were grazed when the swards reached a height of 17, 25 and 23cm, respectively, and with a level of defoliation of 40%. The aerial biomass was determined with a rising plate meter, and the tiller population density (TPD) was estimated by counting tillers in three 10cmdiameter PVC rings per paddock. The mass per tiller was estimated based on the aerial biomass and the TPD of each paddock. Total herbage production did not differ among treatments, with values around 7400kg DM ha(-1). TPD decreased and mass per tiller increased linearly in the monoculture treatments. Tiller size/density compensation was observed in the three plant communities (treatments) according to the self-thinning rule. In addition, no relationships were found when each species was analysed individually in the intercrop treatment. The results suggest that species in grass mixed swards adjust their population to keep a relatively constant leaf area index (LAI) over the grazing seasons, and that would help pastures to stabilize herbage production.

Jatropha (Jatropha curcas) based intercropping systems: An alternate land use for rehabilitation of degraded sodic lands	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						"Alternate land use; Degraded sodic lands; Intercropping; Jatropha curcas; Rehabilitation"	"CRITICAL RESEARCH NEEDS; SOILS; RESTORATION; PLAINS; CARBON; L."	A field study was conducted to evaluate the performance of jatropha based intercropping model as an alternate land use for rehabilitation of degraded sodic lands. Cultivation of Jatropha curcas L. as monocropping has not been proven economically viable because of its late fruiting and poor yield. A small and resource poor farmer having sodic soils can't wait for at least five years to get income. Therefore, the present study was conducted to replace monoculture of jatropha with intercrops in between jatropha plantation in sodic soils to optimize land use efficiency. Study revealed that the plantation of jatropha at 3 in apart and inter- cultivation of sweet basil-matricaria cropping sequence for four years was highly economical than the planting at 3x2m spacing and other tested crop rotations. Soil physicochemical and biological properties in sweet basil-matricaria with jatropha L. as main crop were better than rest of the cropping sequences evaluated. Soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) was also higher with sweet basil-matricaria cropping sequence followed by sorghum-wheat and maize-linseed. The study shows that inter cultivation of Jatropha in sodic soils encouraged biological activities in the rhizosphere. Inter-cultivation of medicinal and aromatic crops under Jatropha plantations for four years was found to be an alternate land use sequence to obtain higher income than the sole plantation of Jatropha in sodic soils. Soil health improvement due to intercropping can provide a better environment for cultivation of highly remunerative crops in future.

To explore the effects of protective methods on soil and nutrient losses from sloping arable land, rainfall runoff plot experiment was conducted from May 2010 to May 2011. For a rotation of wheat and maize, four treatments with three replicates were set up: H1, planting Vetiveria zizanioides contour hedgerows; H2, planting alfalfa contour hedgerows; H3, wheat intercropped with horsebean and maize intercropped with soybean, reduced tillage, and ridge furrow cultivation; and H4, conventional management. Nitrogen and phosphorus losses via surface and subsurface runoff were analyzed. When compared with that in H4, sediment phosphorus losses from plots of H1, H2, and H3 were significantly reduced by 46.61, 30.51, and 37.29%, respectively, while surface runoff total phosphorus loss was reduced by 45.38, 28.46, and 34.62%, respectively. Sediment nitrogen and surface runoff total nitrogen losses were not reduced significantly. Sediments were highly enriched with organic matter and nutrients, and decaying organic matter from plant residuals contributed to sediment nitrogen and phosphorus losses. In sandy loam sloping arable land, contour hedgerows and ridge furrow cultivation were effective in reducing phosphorus loss via surface runoff. However, subsurface runoff is the primary path for nutrient losses, especially for nitrogen loss. Accordingly, attention should be given to improve the management of fertilizer nutrients, soil water, and plant residuals in sandy loam slope land."

The expression levels of PTOX and PGR5 under simulated light quality conditions in line with maize-soybean relay strip intercropping (SRI) were obviously lower than those under simulated soybean monocropping (SM), since the lower red:far-red ratio under SRI. Measurements on photosynthetic and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters suggested a decline of assimilatory power supply and a lower nonphotochemical quenching under SRI as compared to SM. In this case, weaker PGR-dependent cyclic electron transfer and chlororespiration under SRI, suggested by lower expression levels of PGR5 and PTOX, could be considered as means of reducing excitation energy dissipation to allocate more power toward CO2 assimilation.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CA and traditional tillage on soil organic carbon (SOC) and selected hydraulic properties in two contrasting agro-ecological zones of Malawi. Six farmers hosted on-farm trials in each location, with each farmer having the following treatments: CA with continuous sole maize (CA-SM), CA with maize-legume intercrops (CA-ML), and traditional tillage with continuous sole maize (CT-SM). Soil samples were randomly collected in October 2015, from farmers' fields located in Chipeni, Chinguluwe, Lemu, and Zidyana where CA had been implemented for 10 years (2005-2015) at six depth intervals: 0-10, 10-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, and 80-100 cm. Bulk density, soil water characteristics, and pore size distribution were determined using undisturbed core samples. At all sites, CA improved total SOC, carbon stocks, and the stable fraction of particulate organic carbon. Maize-legume intercropping under CA had 35%, 33%, and 73% more total SOC than CT-SM in Chipeni, Lemu, and Zidyana respectively. In Chinguluwe and Lemu, CA-ML had 0.54 and 0.50 g kg(-1)respectively more stable fraction of particulate organic carbon (POMP) than CT-SM; whereas in Chipeni, CA-SM had 0.73 g kg(-1)higher POMP compared with CT-SM. CA also improved soil porosity, pore size distribution, and water retention capacity by increasing the proportion of mesopores and micropores compared with CT-SM. Thus, changing management practices from CT-SM to CA has the potential to improve the soil organic matter and soil hydraulic properties across agro-ecological zones in Malawi, which is important for sustainable agriculture. Farmers should be encouraged to minimise tillage, retain residues as mulch on the soil surface, and practice crop rotation."

Members of Fusarium graminearum species complex (FGSC) were characterized using species and trichothecene-specific primers. Associations between members of the FGSC, cereal crop species (wheat, rye, triticale, and oat), seeding time (winter and spring), type of cultivation (monocrop and intercrop) and chemotype grouping were investigated with multiple correspondence analysis and multiple regression modeling. We found that triticale and oat were more related to isolates classified into F. graminearum s. lato than with other isolates. In contrast, wheat and rye were more associated with F. graminearum s. stricto. Cereal crop species affected the frequencies of F. graminearum s. stricto (p = 0.003) and F. graminearum s. lato (p = 0.08) and unidentified isolates with morphological characteristics like those of FGSC members (p = 0.02). The effectiveness of species-specific primers was 60.3% (Fg16F/R) and 76.2% (FgrF/FgcR), and the effectiveness of primer sets for the trichothecene genotyping of the Tri5 and Tri3 genes was 100% and 90.6%, respectively. The decrease in Fusarium-damaged kernel values in the wheat-pea intercropping system indicated that intercropping systems have the potential to control FHB.

The container experiment involved three winter wheat cultivars, grown as sole crops or intercropped with winter pea under well-watered or drought-stressed conditions. The wheat root activity (characterized by C-R) and the MR-based root length (RL) and root surface area (RSA) were monitored during the vegetation period, the flag leaf chlorophyll content was measured at flowering, and the wheat shoot dry mass (SDM) and grain yield (GY) were determined at maturity. C-R, RL and RSA exhibited similar seasonal patterns with peaks around the flowering. The presence of pea reduced the maximum C-R, RL and RSA. Drought significantly decreased C-R, but increased the MR-based root size. Both intercropping and drought reduced wheat chlorophyll content, SDM and GY. The relative decrease caused by pea or drought in the maximum C-R was proportional to the rate of change in SDM or GY. Significant linear correlations (R-2: 0.77-0.97) were found between C-R and RSA, with significantly smaller specific root capacitance (per unit RSA) for the drought-stress treatments. C-R measurements tend to predict root function and the accompanying effect on above-ground production and grain yield.

Nevertheless, performance and especially the percentage of each species at harvest are often considered highly variable. Nitrogen (N) fertilisation can be a relevant driving factor affecting the percentage of each species at harvest. Soil N availability influences competition for light and nitrogen in cereal-legume intercrops. However, management of N fertilisation still remains unclear for intercrops. Few references on the effects of a range of strategies of N fertilisation are available to guide farmers with relevant decision rules considering their expectations. Here, a modelling approach was proposed to simulate interactions between light and N acquisition of a pea-wheat intercrop and to test different scenarios for the management of such intercrops. A model (Azodyn-IC) was built resulting from the combination of two existing individual-crop models (AZODYN and AFISOL) and by applying rules of light and soil inorganic nitrogen sharing between the intercropped pea and wheat. Evaluation of the model outputs with experimental data showed satisfactory predictions of the studied variables (N accumulation, LAI, and crop dry weight). The model validated both resource sharing and light-N interactions. Furthermore, the model was able to respond to increases in inorganic N availability based upon straightforward formalisms. Simulating unmeasured variables, such as root growth and light interception and use by each species, improved our understanding of the relative dominance of each species for acquiring resources. Eventually, the model was used to simulate different scenarios of N fertilisation over 26 years of climatic data to account for climatic variability. We demonstrated the interest of such a modelling approach to design decision rules of N fertilisation according to farmers' expectations.

An intercropping system combining barley and pea may help increase land productivity as well as to maintain SOC and soil mineral N. We grew barley as a monoculture and intercropped with pea without fertilizers in rows of barley:pea 1:1 and 2:1 as well as broadcast arrangements for two years to observe the effects of species ratios and spatial configuration on land productivity, biological nitrogen fixation and transfer, C and N accumulation in aboveground biomass, soil mineral N balance, gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP), and net ecosystem productivity (NEP). N-15 natural abundance method was used to quantify N fixation and subsequent transfer. Field CO2 exchange measurements used a dynamic closed transparent chamber connected to a portable CO2 analyzer. Intercropping displayed higher land productivity (12-32%) compared to monoculture plots, with 2:1 arrangement producing the highest total land outputs - TLO (5.9 t ha(-1)) and land equivalent ratio - LER (1.32) values. Intercropped barley showed higher biomass N, grain protein and sequestered higher C in soil compared to monocultured barley. Intercropped pea displayed increased nodulation (27-45%) and symbiotic N-2 fixation (9-17%) compared with monoculture pea resulting in the fixation of 60-78 kg N ha(-1). The highest rate of N-transfer (11%), and increased N accumulation (i.e., 200% higher than monocultured barley) in shoot biomass was observed in 1:1 arrangement. However, 2:1 arrangement accumulated higher C (196g Cm-2 year(-1), i.e., 53% higher) in shoot biomass compared to the monoculture barley plots. The 2:1 arrangement also displayed the greatest NEP resulting in the highest soil C sequestration at a seasonal daytime average rate of 229 mg Cm-2 h(-1) (i.e., 10% higher than barley monoculture plots). This study demonstrated that intercropping barley and pea is an efficient strategy to increase land productivity, grain and biomass quality, N and C yields, GEP and NEP, and that planting in rows of 2:1 was the most productive arrangement.

J	"Neumann, A; Werner, J; Rauber, R"				"Neumann, Angelika; Werner, Jochen; Rauber, Rolf"			Evaluation of yield-density relationships and optimization of intercrop compositions of field-grown pea-oat intercrops using the replacement series and the response surface design	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Intercropping; Competition; Optimization; Replacement series design; Response surface design"	"INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; BARLEY INTERCROPS; N-2 FIXATION; MIXTURE EXPERIMENTS; CROP DENSITY; GRAIN-YIELD; SOIL N; MODELS; COMPLEMENTARITY; PRODUCTIVITY"	In a 2-year field experiment (2002/2003) on a loess soil near Gottingen/Germany, pea (Pisum sativum L.) and oat (Avena sativa L) were grown alone and intercropped at a range of densities. Shoot biomass, grain yields and amount of N in grain were evaluated and optimized using two different replacement series and a hyperbolic yield-density equation describing a response surface to address the following questions: (i) what is the optimal composition of the pea-oat intercrop with regard to maximum yields, (ii) which intercropping design is most suitable to describe competition effects in pea-oat intercrops and the optimal intercrop compositions and (iii) which intercropping design is best suited for the evaluation of field data. For (i), the optimal intercrop compositions varied depending on the growth conditions for the crops. Furthermore, optimal intercrop compositions were found above the recommended sole crop densities. The density of oat had to be reduced more than that of pea, especially when optimal grain-N yields were desired and soil-N content was high. For maximum grain-N yields, pea could be sown at high densities in combination with 5-50% of the recommended density of oat. Thus, density can be used as a yield regulator for specific purposes such as a high N yield. The effects of competition at final harvest were described equally by both designs (ii). Oat was the clearly stronger and pea the inferior competitor. In contrast to the replacement series design, the hyperbolic yield-density equation was capable of adding valuable information about the extent of intra and interspecific competition. As intraspecific competition was consistently more important than interspecific competition, resource complementarity could be hold responsible for intercrop advantages. The highest intercrop advantage was found when total intraspecific competition was low, as shown by the relative yield total (RYT) and niche differentiation index (NDI) values >1. However, due to the RYT dependence on sole crops and total densities, the replacement series design led to misleading interpretations of the yield advantages. Both experimental designs were able to describe the field-data reliably (iii), but the response surface design had the advantage of being unaffected by insufficient field emergences, as it is not based on total densities. Numbers of plants m(-2) instead of seeds m(-2) can be used for the evaluation. Data from sole crops are not needed for the response surface design and thus the feared high experimental effort of this design can be reduced. However, when using the replacement series design, experimental effort should be greater than normal, as different sole crop densities and more intercrop compositions within a replacement series can lead to a more precise interpretation of the competition effects.

Exploring options for managing strategies for pea-barley intercropping using a modeling approach	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"Crop model; Intercrop; Pisum sativum; Hordeum vulgare; Yield; Nitrogen"	"DRY-MATTER PRODUCTION; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; N-2 FIXATION; RESOURCE USE; NITROGEN; SYSTEMS; WHEAT; INTERFERENCE; GROWTH; CROPS"	A modeling Study was carried out into pea-barley intercropping in northern Europe. The two objectives were (a) to compare pea-barley intercropping to sole cropping in terms of grain and nitrogen yield amounts and stability, and (b) to explore options for managing pea-barley intercropping systems in order to maximize the biomass produced and the grain and nitrogen yields according to the available resources, such as light, water and nitrogen. The study consisted of simulations taking into account soil and weather variability among three sites located in northern European Countries (Denmark, United Kingdom and France), and using 10 years of weather records. A preliminary stage evaluated the STICS intercrop model's ability to predict grain and nitrogen yields of the two species, using a 2-year dataset from trials conducted at the three sites. The work was carried out in two phases, (a) the model was run to investigate the potentialities of intercrops as compared to sole crops, and (b) the model was run to explore options for managing pea-barley intercropping, asking the following three questions: (i) in order to increase light capture, Would it be worth delaying the sowing dates of one species? (ii) How to manage sowing density and seed proportion of each species in the intercrop to improve total grain yield and N use efficiency? (iii) How to optimize the use of nitrogen resources by choosing the most suitable preceding crop and/or the most appropriate soil? It was found that (1) intercropping made better use of environmental resources as regards yield amount and stability than sole cropping, with a noticeable site effect, (2) pea growth in intercrops was strongly linked to soil moisture, and barley yield was determined by nitrogen uptake and light interception due to its height relative to pea, (3) sowing barley before pea led to a relative grain yield reduction averaged over all three sites, but sowing strategy must be adapted to the location, being dependent on temperature and thus latitude, (4) density and species proportions had a small effect on total grain yield, underlining the interspecific offset in the use of environmental growth resources which led to similar total grain yields whatever the pea-barley design, and (5) long-term strategies including mineralization management through organic residue supply and rotation management were very valuable, always favoring intercrop total grain yield and N accumulation.

Intercrop plants were separated as common vetch (called as common vetch I) and barley (called as barley 1). Plants were seeded in April of both years in a randomized complete block design with 3 replications. The study plots were 3.0 m long by 1.68 m wide, with 24 cm row spacing. Each plot was fertilized with 20 ton ha(-1) organic farmyard manure. The year effects were significant in dry matter yield, crude protein, crude protein yield, acid detergent fiber and neutral detergent fiber. The legumes especially were injured by frost in 2007. Significant differences were found in terms of Dry Matter Yield (DMY), Crude Protein (CP), Crude Protein Yield (CPY), Acid Detergent Fiber (ADF), Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF), Dry Matter Intake (DMI), Dry Digestible Matter (DDM) and Relative Feed Value (RFV) amongst all the plants. Sole common vetch and sole barley had good properties in DMY, CP and CPY. Sole grass pea, common vetch (I), sole common vetch and intercrops showed good quality properties in ADF and NDF. Sole grass pea especially, sole common vetch and common vetch (I) had good quality properties in DMI, DDM and RFV. Farmers should prefer sole common vetch and sole grass pea cultivation in yield and quality and regulate their seeding times according to days with frost in similiar conditions.

Smallholders can employ numerous practices to control weeds such as intercropping cereal crops with legumes. We conducted a review to identify the possible mechanisms responsible for weed control according to legume species, weed species and agroecosystem. In the review, we first present common weed species found in specific agroecological contexts. Then, we propose several legume intercrops that provide some control of these species and the reasons why. Finally, we highlight possible social and biophysical tradeoffs for cultivating legumes as a weed control practice in smallholder cereal systems. The review found that while many studies explained the effect a certain legume-intercrop had upon weeds (e.g., emergence rates), few identified the mechanism or mechanisms (e.g., increased predation) behind their control. Without understanding these mechanisms, it is difficult to propose management recommendations for intercropping (e.g., seeding rates). Furthermore, few studies have investigated how legume intercrops affect multiple components of farming systems, including the smallholders that cultivate them.

Dynamics of phosphorus fractions in the rhizosphere of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and durum wheat (Triticum turgidum durum L.) grown in monocropping and intercropping systems	PLANT AND SOIL			English	"Article; Proceedings Paper"	2nd International Conference on Rhizosphere	AUG, 2007	Montpellier, FRANCE			"rhizosphere phosphorus fractions; proton release; phosphorus acquisition; root interaction"	"CLUSTER-ROOT-FORMATION; AFFECTING SOIL ACIDIFICATION; LUPINUS-ALBUS; PROTON RELEASE; ORGANIC-MATTER; PHOSPHATE ROCK; MIXED CULTURE; AESTIVUM L.; NUTRITION; ACID"	The main objective of the present study was to investigate phosphorus (P) dynamics in the rhizosphere of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum durum L.) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) grown in monocropping and intercropping systems with nitrate supply. Wheat and common bean were grown either alone or in association in a cropping device with a thin (1 mm) soil layer sandwiched between large root mats. Wheat intercropped with common bean exhibited a 33% increase in shoot biomass and a 22% increased root biomass, without significantly affecting common bean growth. After 12 days of culture, rhizosphere pH decreased by 1.66 and 1.13 units in monocropping system of common bean and intercropping system, respectively. Wheat increased intercropped common bean proton release by 36% compared with monocropped beans. Common bean and wheat exhibited different behaviors in rhizosphere P dynamics. Monocropped wheat decreased Resin-P, NaHCO3-P and NaOH-P in its rhizosphere by 24, 96 and 10%, respectively. However, NaHCO3-P and NaOH-P were increased by 61 and 10% in the rhizosphere of intercropping. Almost all values about P fraction in intercropping system were between those in monocropped common bean and monocropped wheat. Through taping different P fraction, different plants species possibly can alleviate competition for phosphorus in intercropping system.

Isolation and identification of Desmodium root exudates from drought tolerant species used as intercrops against Striga hermonthica	PHYTOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						"Desmodium uncinatum; Desmodium intortum; Desmodium incanum; Desmodium ramosissimum; Striga hermonthica; Parasitic weeds; Root exudate; Di-C-glycosylflavone; Striga inhibition"	"PUSH-PULL TECHNOLOGY; WESTERN KENYA; UNCINATUM; FARMERS; STEMBORER; PATHWAYS; MAIZE; WEEDS; SPP."	Plants from the genus Desmodium, in particular D. uncinatum, are used on sub-Saharan small-holder farms as intercrops to inhibit parasitism of cereal crops by Striga hermonthica and Striga asiatica via an allelopathic mechanism. The search for Desmodium species which are adapted to more arid conditions, and which show resilience to increased drought stress, previously identified D. intortum, D. incanum and D. ramosissimum as potential drought tolerant intercrops. Their potential as intercrops was assessed for resource poor areas of rain-fed cereal production where drought conditions can persist through normal meteorological activity, or where drought may have increasing impact through climate change. The chemical composition of the root exudates were characterised and the whole exudate biological activity was shown to be active in pot experiments for inhibition of Striga parasitism on maize. Furthermore, rain fed plot experiments showed the drought tolerant Desmodium intercrops to be effective for Striga inhibition. This work demonstrates the allelopathic nature of the new drought tolerant intercrops through activity of root exudates and the major compounds seen in the exudates are characterised as being C-glycosylflavonoid. In young plants, the exudates show large qualitative differences but as the plants mature, there is a high degree of convergence of the C-glycosylfiavonoid exudate chemical profile amongst active Desmodium intercrops that confers biological activity. This defines the material for examining the mechanism for Striga inhibition. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	"[Hooper, A. M.; Caulfield, J. C.; Hao, B.; Pickett, J.

The experimental design comprised randomized blocks, with four replications, two types of corn cultivation, intercropped with two Brachiaria species (marandu grass and convert grass), and with and without intercropping with the pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) BRS Mandarin. Dry matter productivity, the morphological composition of the corn, the botanical composition of the Brachiaria and pigeon peas, and the bromatological composition of the silage and Brachiaria were evaluated, as well as the losses caused by effluents. The consortia did not interfere with the productivity of corn for silage, and the silage from the consortium with pigeon peas exhibited a higher concentration of crude protein, demonstrating that the modality of the integrated agricultural production system of corn culture with Brachiaria and pigeon peas is an alternative to increase the protein content of the ensiled material and provide greater diversity of the remaining forage.

Intercropping practices adopted in monocultural woody crops, with herbaceous crops covering the otherwise bare alleyways, foster ecological interactions and can provide both environmental and economic advantages. In this study, intercropping practices were implemented in a traditional mandarin orchard in south-eastern Spain, which was monitored for three years to assess their impact on the environmental footprint and profitability. The footprint was quantified with a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA), while the costs and revenues assessment was based on materials, labor, and machinery used in the trial. The calculated LCA indicators evidenced that, although the cultivated surface area increases with the integration of the intercrops (fava bean, purslane, cowpea, and barley/vetch mix), this does not imply any additional detrimental effects (resource depletion, acidification, eutrophication, global warming). The economic analysis showed that while intercrops may involve additional production costs, the correct choice of intercrops, purslane, and fava bean, in this case, can reduce the market risks for farmers. Overall, this study shows that positive environmental and economic impacts are to be expected of co-integrated herbaceous crops within the same field as mandarin trees.

Soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions in temperate alley cropping systems	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS			English	Article						"microbial biomass; mineral associated organic matter; particulate organic matter; pecan; silver maple"	"MICROBIAL BIOMASS; MATTER; MINERALIZATION; RESPIRATION; MAIZE"	Alley cropping may promote greater sequestration of soil organic carbon. The objective of this study was to examine spatial variability of soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) fractions relative to tree rows in established alley cropping systems in north central Missouri. Soils were collected to a depth of 30 cm from two alley cropped sites, a 19-yr-old pecan (Carya illinoinensis)/bluegrass (Poa trivialis) intercrop (pecan site) and an 11-yr-old silver maple (Acer saccharinum)/soybean (Glycine max)-maize (Zea mays) rotation (maple site). Particulate organic matter (POM) C constituted 15-65% and 14-41% of total organic C (TOC) at the pecan and maple sites respectively, whereas POM N comprised 3 to 24% of total N (TKN). TOC and TKN were on average 13% and 18% higher at the tree row than at the middle of the alley for surface soils (0 - 10 cm) at the pecan site, respectively. Similarly, POM C was two to three times higher at the tree row than the alley for subsurface soils at the maple site. No differences in microbial biomass C and N between positions were observed. Observed results suggest the existence of spatially dependent patterns for POM C, TOC, and TKN, relative to tree rows in alley cropping.

The traditional method of cultivation includes surface mulching the banana mats with the pseudostems, leaves and peels following harvests. Bananas are frequently intercropped and a wide range of other plant residues are retained as surface mulches. The most common of these intercrops are beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) and maize (Zen mays). The decomposition and nutrient release of banana pseudostems, leaves and peels, maize stover and bean trash was studied. Black plastic litter bags were placed in the field and recovered after 0, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 weeks. The effect of soil fauna was estimated by altering the screen openings of the litter bags (2 vs 5 mm). For fresh banana pseudostems, litter bags were place on the surface or buried to study the effect of soil incorporation. Litter materials were analysed for C, N, P, K and lignin. The results were fit to first order exponential decline and the decomposition coefficient (k) used to calculate the time to 50% mass and nutrient loss (t(50)). The organic resources decomposed in the order bean trash > banana peel > maize stover = banana pseudostems > banana leaves. Exclusion of soil macrofauna (2-5 mm) delayed decomposition of banana pseudostems, when applied as mulch. When field availability and tissue concentrations are taken into account, banana leaves and bean trash have the greatest potential to recycle N (25 and 29 kg ha(-1) y(-1), respectively) and banana leaves and pseudostem recycle the greatest amounts of K (43 and 26 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)). The combined contribution of banana leaves, pseudostems, maize stover and bean trash to recycling nutrients in this farming system was 69 kg N and 147 kg K ha(-1).

Providing tools to improve the management of this critical phase in intercrops is a challenge for agroecology as these cropping systems are the subject of renewed interest for their ability to maintain yields while requiring fewer inputs. The aim of the present study was to investigate variations in early growth under different sowing conditions in different species with contrasted seed and seedling characteristics (seed mass, hypogeal or epigeal emergence, and legume and non-legume species), especially species used as intercrops. Experiments were carried out in glasshouses using different sowing depths and levels of mineral nutrition, first for each species separately, then in mixed sowings. In the first set of experiments, biomass at emergence and relative growth rate after emergence were measured and then modelled as a function of seed mass, mineral nutrition, and time to emergence. Predictive equations were tested by comparing simulations with biomass measured in the second set of experiments, for two intercrops grown under varied sowing conditions. Finally, simulations were run to analyse variations in the early growth of two intercrops (durum wheat/pea or alfalfa) under a wider range of sowing conditions (seed mass, sowing depth, and with or without mineral nutrition). Biomass at emergence was positively correlated with seed mass, and in epigeal species, was also negatively impacted by time to emergence. Relative growth rate was highly stimulated by mineral nutrition whereas its response to time to emergence varied among species. The amount of seminal reserves at emergence (in hypogeal species) and the cotyledon specific mass (in epigeal species) were correlated with the establishment of the relative growth rate. When evaluated, the model was shown to satisfactorily predict the early growth of two intercrops. Used as a simulation tool, the model indicated that all the sowing techniques tested can have a major influence on total biomass and on the proportion of each component species when competition begins. This model can thus contribute to the management of sowing techniques for sole as well as combined crops whose effects are difficult to predict and are also difficult to analyse from field experiments alone because of the number of possible combinations and interactions.

Compared to leaves of Chromolaena (3.3% N), N concentrations were lower in those of Senna and Acacia, and higher in Leucaena. Acacia and Leucaena had higher polyphenol relative to the natural fallow (2%), The lignin was lower in Leucaena than the natural fallow leaves (14%). For 65% of the sampling dates, earthworm numbers under all fallows were significantly higher than under continuous maize-cassava, The mean earthworm numbers (no. m(-2)) during the rainy season (April-October) decreased in the following order: Chromolaena (147), Senna (131), Leucaena (92), Acacia (80), and maize-cassava (14). Earthworm fresh weights in fallow plots were higher than in the maize-cassava plot, though this was significant for only 4 out of 11 sampling dates. Higher earthworm numbers and biomass in fallow plots were attributed to higher litterfall, lower soil temperature, and higher soil moisture. The mean earthworm numbers were directly correlated with the mean soil moistures (r(2) = 0.80, P < 0.05) in fallow plots and N/polyphenol ratios of fallow litterfall (r(2) = 0,95, P < 0,05). Increase in earthworm population by fallows led to an increase in leaf-litter decomposition, soil organic matter, available P, and extractable cations and pH; and a decrease in soil bulk density and penetrometer resistance in the fallow plots."

We tested the effects of providing food and alternative hosts to parasitoids by intercropping a plum orchard with companion plants. Oats and vetch were intercropped into the orchard either as single-species (oats or vetch) or two-species (oats and vetch combined) intercrops within an inter-row. The trophic resources provided by these intercrops were assessed, along with the incidences of aphids and their parasitoids in plum trees. We found up to ten alternative host species provided by oats and vetch, and extrafloral nectar was available from the vetch and mixed strips. An effect of intercrop type and distance to plum trees was observed on aphid incidence during one sampling period. Parasitism rates in exclusion cages were affected by intercrop type, reaching almost 60% close to the mixed intercrop. However, no general tendency was observed upon whether oats, vetch or their mixture was associated with a lower incidence of aphids. We found no evidence that providing effective sources of food and alternative hosts for parasitoids increased aphid mortality in this study. The context-dependent efficiency of intercropping is discussed.

Incorporation of Legume Residues Does Not Increase Productivity of Intercropped Beans on Smallholder Farms in Trans-Nzoia District, Kenya	BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE & HORTICULTURE			English	Article							"MANAGEMENT; DISEASES"	"Smallholder farmers in Trans-Nzoia District, Kenya, observed poor productivity of intercropped beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) where residues of the soil-improving legume Lablab purpureus L. had been incorporated prior to maize (Zen mays L.) and bean planting. On-farm research involving IS replicated trials was undertaken to evaluate if lablab residues affected bean yield and the severity of farmers' pre-existing soilborne bean pest problems. The study compared incorporated lablab residues with four other maize fertilization strategies, diammonium phosphate (DAP), a DAP and farmyard manure (FYM) mixture, incorporated Mucuna pruriens L. residues, and a no-input check. In addition to yield, the abundance of root-feeding chafer grubs (Schizonycha spp.) and the mortality rates of a root rot-susceptible versus a root rot-tolerant bean variety were assessed. Beans in the lablab and mucuna residue treatments performed as poorly as in the no-input control, possibly because of legume residue-induced nutrient immobilization for the first 4-6 weeks of the growing season. During the seedling stage, the beans in the legume residue and no input treatments had lower vigour and higher damping-off rates than the DAP and DAP/FYM treatments. Later in the growing season, there was continued plant mortality in the legume residue treatments; this coincided with significantly higher populations of root-feeding chafer grubs found in those treatments. At harvest, grain yields in the legume and no input treatments were, on average, 36% lower than the DAP and DAP plus FYM treatments. Incorporating residues earlier and applying more readily available fertilizer at planting may help farmers to mitigate some of the legumes' negative effects."

With the growing need to explore and manage variations in agro-ecosystems these results deserve new attention. They quantify, in a simple but detailed manner, the influence of hedgerows on the microclimate of their intercrop and for comparison provide a sole maize (SM) control. Due to inhomogeneity of Cassia and maize, as well as limited budgets, the sampling methodology and the choice of appropriate equipment, including the sensors, demanded special attention. The diurnal patterns of soil temperatures at 7.5 cm depth represented well the shading patterns of the hedgerows. This can be developed into an operational auxiliary methodology of integrated shade quantification. With proper precautions, the developed sampling methodologies showed appropriately the time integrated values of the three microclimatic parameters with enough detail to understand yield differences between treatments and between rows. This approach may therefore be recommended for on-farm quantification of even greater spatial variability of parameters. The limitations of the selected methods are highlighted. Experiences with some alternative methods are also discussed.

Intercropping cassava with maize had no significant effect on M. tanajoa and associated phytoseiid predator populations during tile intercropping, dry, and postdry seasons. The acaricide spray reduced ill. tanajoa densities 50% below those of the predator and the control (no predator and no spray) treatments. A. manihoti reduced ill. tanajoa densities 20% below the control treatment by the end of the experiment. Agric supported 2-3 times more mites per leaf than did TMS 30572. A pest management strategy that combines resistant cultivars and an efficient exotic predator is suggested to control M. tanajoa.

The barley/kale bi-crop was grown as a strip intercrop, and was harvested and ensiled as an intimate mixture [0.80 barley and 0.20 kale on a dry-matter (DM) basis]. Animals were offered ad libitum access to one of three experimental diets in a duplicated Latin Square design experiment: (i) Bi-crop (the barley/kale bi-crop); (ii) Grass (the grass silage); and (iii) Mix (a 1:1 fresh mixture of Bi-crop and Grass). All animals also received a standard dairy concentrate at a rate of 4 kg d(-1) in equal portions at each of two milkings. The Bi-crop and Grass silages contained 346 and 293 g DM kg(-1), 108 and 168 g crude protein kg(-1) DM, 268 and 36 g starch kg(-1) DM, and had pH values of 3.87 and 3.80 respectively. Animals offered the two bi-crop silage-containing diets consumed more forage DM than those offered grass silage (14.6, 14.9 and 12.6 kg DM d(-1) for Bi-crop, Mix and Grass respectively; s.e.d. 0.45, P < 0.01) and yielded more milk (24.0, 23.9, 22.6 kg d(-1) for Bi-crop, Mix and Grass respectively; s.e.d. 0.26, P < 0.01). However, differences in the partitioning of dietary nitrogen towards milk protein and away from excretion in urine suggest a more efficient (rumen) utilization of feed protein by animals offered diets containing the bi-crop silage. It is concluded that, despite having a low crude protein concentration, barley/kale bi-crop silage offers excellent potential as a feed for lactating dairy cows."

Intercropping was as follows: 1 row corn to 1 row soybean (1M1S), 1 row corn to 2 rows soybean (1M2S) and 2 rows corn to 1 row soybean (2M1S). The crops were harvested when the corn reached 3/5 or 1/4 milk line. The silage samples were analysed for pH, dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), neutral (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF), calcium, potassium, magnesium and phosphorus. Also, in vitro true (IVTD) and in vitro NDF (IVNFD) digestibilities were determined in the silages samples. The DM, EE, calculated non structural carbohydrate values were higher in silage harvested at 1/4 than 3/5 milk line. All intercropped silages had higher CP values (1M1S, 8.3%; 1M2S, 10.1%; 2M1S, 8.0%) than the monocrop corn (SM, 6.8%) silage. The NDF and ADF levels were higher for 1M1S, 2M1S and SM compared with 1M2S and monocrop soybean (SS) silage.

Although intercropping is practiced on a non-negligible proportion of China's arable land, little is known about the factors that influence farmers' decisions to use intercropping. In this study we develop a theoretical framework that distinguishes exogenous factors from endogenous factors in farmers' activity choices in general and the use of intercropping in particular. We apply this framework in an empirical analysis of socio-economic factors affecting the use of traditional and novel relay intercropping systems, with a special focus on the impact of farm size, using primary data collected among 299 farmers in Gaotai County, northwest China. We find that large farms do no not plant more land with the traditional wheat/maize intercrop as compared to small farms, while land planted with the two novel intercrops is significantly larger on large farms. Availability of machinery has no negative effect on the area under intercropping, and has a significant positive effect on the use of one novel intercrop type. Our results confirm that risk considerations do not play a role in relay intercropping use decisions of Chinese farmers. We conclude that positive yield and natural resource effects of intercropping can still be realized if the ongoing farm scale enlargement policy is combined with a policy promoting novel intercropping types, particularly those types that can make use of already available machinery.

The cropping pattern that recorded the highest net income varied with the year. In 1997, the driest year of the past several decades, cassava single-cropping was the highest in income. The proposed intercropping system {cassava/(maize soybean --> cowpea)} was the highest in 1998, a year with moderate rainfall. In 1999, when severe insect damage occurred to legume crops, the farmers' conventional intercropping was the highest. In an average of the three years, the proposed intercropping pattern was same as cassava single-cropping, although cowpea cultivation as the dry season cropping was not possible in this region. The amount of soil erosion was relatively high in cassava monoculture in comparison with the other intercropping and crop-rotation systems. Cassava roots penetrated to only 0.5 m deep and extended 1 to 2 m in a horizontal direction depending on the planting density. These results lead to the conclusion that the proposed cassava cropping system would be the most beneficial in terms of economy and control of soil erosion.

(JCL) as an alternative crop on degraded sodic land in north India. Monoculture of JCL has not proven economically viable in India in view of its poor yield; therefore, intercrops in between JCL plantations were tried to optimize land use efficiency. The results revealed that the planting of JCL at 3 x 3 m spacing with inter-cultivation of sweet basil-matricaria (SB-M) cropping system for four years was more economically viable than planting at 3 x 2 m spacing and the other rotations tested in the study. Improvements in soil properties in terms of soil pH, EC and organic carbon were found with the SB-M cropping system with JCL as the main crop. Maximum soil microbial biomass carbon was recorded with the SB-M cropping system followed by sorghum-wheat (S-W) and maize-linseed (M-L), and the lowest values were found in the control plot where no intercrop was planted in between JCL plants. This study shows that intercropping with JCL on sodic soils stimulated the soil microbial population, which in turn led to high biological activity in the rhizosphere soil. Growing of medicinal and aromatic crops as intercrops between JCL plantations for four years appears to be a more suitable land use system than JCL mono-cropping to obtain maximum income. Simultaneously a soil improvement due to intercropping provides a new opportunity for even more competitive land use systems in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

One aim of this research was to analyze actual adoption by smallholders of such a technology and influencing factors in the Southern Guinea Savannah in Benin (West Africa). On the other hand, a second objective was to measure agronomic and economic performances of the innovative yam-based cropping systems in comparison with the usual ones under producers' natural and socioeconomic circumstances in order to discuss the technology potential for large scale adoption. Smallholders with limited land access now develop as usual cropping systems a one-year fallow of Andropogonon gayanus-yam rotation or a maize-yam rotation. Innovative sedentary yam-based systems consist of an Aeschynomene histrix intercropped with maize-yam rotation or a Mucuna pruriens intercropped with maize-yam rotation. Factors potentially affecting adoption were included in a polynomial logit model. Agronomic and economic performances were assessed by the multiple regression and net present value of the 4-years double rotation. Ranking matrix was used to highlight constraints that may impede adoption. Benefits, lessons, and challenges are discussed in this article.

However, soybean is highly sensitive to shading. It is unclear if soybean morphology responds to shading (i.e., shade tolerance or avoidance) and which features may be suitable as screening materials in relay strip intercropping. Therefore, in this study, various agronomic characteristics of different soybean genotypes were analyzed under relay inter cropping conditions. The soybean materials used in this study exhibited genetic diversity, and the coefficient of variations of the agronomic parameters ranged from 13.84 to 72.08% during the shade period and from 6.44 to 52.49% during the maturity period. The ratios of shading to full irradiance in stem mass fraction (SMF) were almost greater than 1, whereas opposite results were found in the leaves. Compared with full irradiance, the average stem length (SL), leaf area ratio (LAR) and specific leaf area (SLA) for the two years (2013 and 2014) increased by 0.78, 0.47 and 0.65 under shady conditions, respectively. However, the stem diameter (SD), total biomass (TB), leaf area (LA), number of nodes (NN) on the main stem, and number of branches (BN) all decreased. During the shady period, the SL and SMF exhibited a significant negative correlation with yield, and the SD exhibited a significant positive correlation with yield. The correlation between the soybean yield and agronomic parameters during the mature period, except for SL, the first pod height (FPH), 100-seed weight (100-SW), and reproductive growth period (RGP), were significant (P<0.01), especially for seed weight per branch (SWB), pods per plant (PP), BN, and vegetative growth period (VGP). These results provide an insight into screening the shade tolerance of soybean varieties and can be useful in targeted breeding programs of relay intercropped soybeans.

A meta-analysis	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Intercropping; Companion plant; Meta-analysis; Weed; Yield"	"WINTER OILSEED RAPE; LIVING MULCH SYSTEM; MAIZE ZEA-MAYS; COVER CROPS; COMPETITIVE ABILITY; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; WHEAT; PRODUCTIVITY; L.; TILLAGE"	Companion plant intercropping involves growing a cash crop with another plant that is not harvested, to confer a set of benefits on the crop and the environment. Weed control and herbicide use reduction are one of the principal reasons for adopting this approach. Companion plants should compete with weeds for light, nutrients and water, but they may also compete with the crop. The species grown must therefore be carefully chosen and managed so as to outcompete weeds but limit competition with the crop and yield loss. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to quantify the effects of companion plants on weed regulation and cash crop yields, and to analyze their sources of variability. We reviewed different intercropping systems involving an annual cash crop and a legume companion plant from around the world. We report data from 34 scientific articles, corresponding to 476 experimental units (i.e. combinations of site x year x cash crop x legume companion plant species x agricultural practices), and we explore whether intercropping with legume companion plants can control weeds while maintaining crop yield. Yield and weed biomass ratios were analyzed as response variables. We used the type of cash crop (straw cereals, maize or other crops), the methods used to establish the companion plants (living mulch, synchronized sowing or relay intercropping) and the overlap between the growth periods of the companion plants and the cash crop as explanatory variables. lntercropping with a companion plant resulted in a lower weed biomass and a higher yield (win win situation) than non-weeded or weeded control treatments, in 52% and 36%, respectively, of the experimental units considered. A higher weed biomass associated with a lower yield (lose -lose) was observed in only 13% and 26% of the experimental units, in comparisons with non-weeded and weeded control treatments, respectively. Considering all the experimental units together, the companion plants had no significant effect on cash crop yield, but significantly decreased weed biomass, by 56% relatively to a non-weeded control treatment, and 42% relative to a weeded control treatment. The greatest benefits from companion plant intercropping were reported for maize, with yields 37% higher than those for non-weeded control treatments. The other explanatory variables tested had no significant effect on yield or weed control. Thus, the use of legume companion plants generally seems to enhance weed control without reducing crop yield, but the conditions giving rise to win-win situations should be explored further, to encourage the spread of this technique among farmers.

A pot experiment using the N-15 isotope dilution method demonstrated interspecific competition and use of N from the soil and N-2 fixation in intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & D.R. Dewey, IWG) and white clover (Trifolium repens L., WC) intercrops at five species-relative frequencies and four levels of inorganic N fertilizer in a replacement series design. The proportion of N in WC derived from the atmosphere increased from 39.7% in a sole crop to 70.9% when intercropped with IWG, and 10.1% N in IWG transferred from WC. Intermediate wheatgrass showed high fitness with maintained high total dry matter production at low relative frequencies. Decreasing IWG-relative frequency only increased dry matter and N accumulation of WC, resulting in increased amounts of N-2 fixed. Increased levels of N fertilization increased the proportion of N acquired from the fertilizer in IWG and WC but decreased the N fixed by WC and N absorbed by IWG from the soil. Our study indicates that WC supply sufficient fixed N-2 for IWG intercrop biomass yields under appropriate levels of soil N fertility and species-relative frequencies.

Data from 70 crop-nutrient response trials conducted in Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Tanzania were used to evaluate nutrient application effects on nutrient concentrations for grain of five pulse and five cereal crops and for storage roots of cassava (Manihot esculenta L.). Treatments per trial were >= 12, but this study was limited to: no fertilizer applied; macronutrients applied (NPK or PK); and the macronutrient treatment plus Mg, S, Zn, and B applied (MgSZnB).

Concentrations of N and K were positively correlated with concentrations of most other nutrients. The concentrations were relatively low overall for cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) and pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.) compared with other pulse crops and for maize (Zea mays L.) compared with other cereal crops. Application of NPK or PK had little effect on nutrient concentrations, except for increased mean cereal grain concentrations for N, Ca, Mg, S, Zn, Cu, and B. Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), maize and rice (Oryza sativa L.) grain concentrations were reduced by MgSZnB for N, K, S, Cu, Mn, and B. There were no or inconsistent effects of MgSZnB on other crop-nutrient concentrations.

Disturbance and competition drive diversity effects in cabbage-aphid-onion systems with intra-specific genetic variation	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						"genetic variability; competition; intercropping; disturbance"	"ECO-EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS; PEA APHID; INSECT; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITY; ROOT; PRODUCTIVITY; RESISTANCE; GROWTH; YIELD"	Decreased reliance on pesticides can be achieved through a clever use of eco-evolutionary knowledge via intercropping economically valuable crops with companion plants that can hamper pest outbreaks. We created a greenhouse multi-layered microcosm system to test two potato peach aphid clones, performing alone or in competition, on mixes of genetically variable cultivars of cabbage, with and without onion. The onion acted as a nuisance/disturbance for the pest, which was generally for the benefit of the cabbage albeit both plants sharing space and nutrients. The onion effect was context-specific and differed by aphid genotype. Onion variable nuisance negatively affected the numbers of one aphid genotype (green) across all contexts, while the other genotype (pink) numbers were decreased in two contexts only. However, the green performed better than the pink on all cases of cabbage di-mixes despite its numbers being capped when the onion was present. Further, there was also a general aphid propensity to wander off the plant along with a differential production of winged morphs to escape the onion-affected environments. Moreover, through a comparative increase in dry mass, which was subject to onion and aphid effects, a diversity effect was found where the cabbages of fully genetically variable microcosms sustained similar final dry mass compared with non-infested microcosms.

Strip cropping of alternating perennial grass-clover and annual rye-vetch intercrops when grown within an organic farming system	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Cropping system; Soil mineral N; Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF); Competitive interactions; Annuals and perennials"	"PEA-BARLEY INTERCROPS; NITROGEN DYNAMICS; SOIL-NITROGEN; RADIATION-USE; YIELD; WHEAT; COMPETITION; FIXATION; STABILITY; PASTURES"	A field experiment was carried out including alternating perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L)-clover (Trifolium repens + Trifolium pretense L) pasture mix with annual winter rye (Secale cereale L)-vetch (Vicia villosa L) intercrops. The annuals were established after soil incorporation of a 1st-year grass-clover in a 6-m wide strip as both inter- (IC) and sole crops (SC): (1) rye SC, (2) vetch SC and (3) rye-vetch IC. The perennial strips were established without incorporating the 1st-year grass-clover in an equivalent 6-m wide strip. This resulted in an early interspecific competitive advantage for the perennial strip and especially limiting growth of the rye component. Relative clover proportion in the sward increased with increasing distance to the annual strip indicating more available soil mineral N in the interface between the perennial and the annual strip. Compensative growth of the grass-clover when grown in close proximity to the annual strip was only partly counterbalancing the decreased total crop productivity in the rye-vetch intercrop. Across the whole growing season (September-August) approximately the same amount of biomass was produced when dividing the field into strips (6 in x 6 m) as compared to growing the same area with the traditional single-field cropping strategy. There was a greater total aboveground plant N uptake in sole cropped vetch and the rye-vetch intercrop compared to the rye sole crop due to vetch N-2-fixation, but with severe vetch-growth depression when intercropped. The amount of vetch-N-2 fixed was reduced with about 9 gN m(-2) when intercropped as compared to the sole cropping situation. Light interception by the annual crop when grown in close proximity to the grass-clover strip was reduced due to the lower aboveground biomass yield and assumed belowground competitive interactions. Less soil water content below the perennial strip indicated greater water uptake, than below the annual strips. Unfortunately, the present strip cropping system did not possess the right balance of co-existence and complementarity. However, from a practical point of view the system was manageable indicating potentials to diversify agricultural fields and develop future cropping systems which are more complex and thereby resilient to externalities.

The randomized block experiment was designed with four cropping patterns (sugarcane monocropping (MS), soybean monocropping (MB), sugarcane/soybean (1:1) intercropping (SB1), and sugarcane/soybean (1:2) intercropping (SB2)) and two rates of N fertilization (300 kg hm(-2) (N1, reduced rate) and 525 kg hm(-2) (N2, conventional rate)). The results showed that the land equivalent ratio (LER) of all intercropping systems was greater than 1 (between 1.10 and 1.84), and the SB2-N1 optimally improved the land utilization rate among all treatments. The cropping patterns and N applied rates had no significant effect on sugarcane yield. The soybean yield was influenced by different cropping patterns because of different planting densities (4, 8 and 16 rows of soybean were plant under SB1, SB2, and MB, respectively) and was adopted in this experiment. In addition, under the SB2 cropping pattern, the soybean yield at the reduced N application rate was higher than that at the conventional N application rate. Wricke's ecovalence (W-i(2)), the sustainable yield index (SYI) and the coefficient of variation (CV) were used to evaluate yield stability. Different treatments had no significant effects on sugarcane yield stability, as demonstrated by three indicators (W-i(2), SYI and CV), which indicated that intercropping with soybean and reduced N rate had no effect on sugarcane yield. For soybeans, the value of W-i(2) demonstrated that the stability of the intercropping system was higher than its counterpart monocropping system, as SYI and CV values indicated that SB2 had higher stability than SB1. During seven years of experiments, there was no significant difference in the soil fertility between MS and SB patterns. The soybean monocropping had a higher available K, pH and lower available P content than sugarcane inter- and mono-cropping. Different cropping patterns had a slight impact on N2O emissions and the greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) value. Higher N input promoted N2O emissions and increased GHGI values. In conclusion, the present study observed that a 40% reduced nitrogen input combined with intercropping soybeans could maintain sugarcane yield and soil sustainable utilization, and that higher N fertilizer additions induced negative impacts on greenhouse gases emissions. Sugarcane intercropping with soybeans can reduce chemical fertilizer input and simultaneously maintain crop productivity; thus, it can be considered to be a reasonable practice for field management.

J	Ghosh, PK				Ghosh, PK			Agronomic and economic evaluation of groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) cereal fodder intercropping during the post-rainy season	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article								A field trial was conducted on groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) intercropping during post-rainy seasons of 1996 and 1997 with 3 cereal fodders, maize (Zea mays L.), pearlmillet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br. emend. Stuntz] and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] to provide green fodder during the dry season, and to assess the profitability of intercropping system over prevailing practice of sole cropping of groundnut in post-rainy season. The green fodder yield was the highest in pearlmillet with 2 cuts. The highest pod yield (24 q/ha) was recorded in sole groundnut. Significant reduction in yields, yield attributes, leaf area, nodule mass of groundnut were recorded when 2 cuts of pearlmillet and sorghum were planned. However, such yield reduction was nullified by high fodder yield and high net returns obtained from 2 cuts of pearlmillet. Thus, 2 cuts of pearlmillet, one at 60 days and the other at 106 days in association with summer groundnut not only provided additional income to the farmer but also mitigated the fodder scarcity to some extent in dry season.

Savi ex Hassk.] and redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) grown at different levels of phosphorus (P), planting densities, and density proportions, were studied under field conditions in Summer 2001. Both species behaved differently in response to different planting densities, density proportions, and P treatments. Shoot dry weights (DW) of cowpea increased in line with its proportion in the mixture, and cowpea leaf area was greater than that of A. retroflexus, but the weed over-topped the cowpea plants and established a greater leaf area over the crop canopy. The CO2 assimilation rate of A. retroflexus was greater than that of cowpea. In mixed stands, A. retroflexus produced relatively higher yields when present in an equal proportion with cowpea, with a relative aggressivity of 0.42. CO2 assimilation rate was the parameter that contributed most to variations in the shoot DWs of both species. The effect of proportion of the mixed density on shoot DW was due mainly to its effect on the CO2 exchange rate required for carbohydrate production and growth.

The first intercropping was cultivated with beans, sesame and pigeon pea, whereas the second was cultivated with cotton, maize, beans, sesame and pigeon pea. Two areas under NV, adjacent to the crop areas, were also sampled. Soil sampling were collected from 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30 and 30-50 cm layers in three plots per area to characterise the SOM (SOC, soil nitrogen, humic substances, microbial biomass, and mineralisable carbon). Our results demonstrated that, when compared with the NV, intercropping systems conducted with minimum soil tillage were effective in maintaining and sometimes increasing the levels and stocks of SOC and some SOM fractions such as microbial C and humic substances, and therefore, these systems can be an alternative form of sustainable soil management in the semiarid region of Brazil.

Since management systems alter the quantity and quality of organic matter, this study evaluated the influence of different management systems and cover crops on the organic matter dynamics of a dystrophic Red Latosol under vegetables. The treatments consisted of the combination of three soil tillage systems: no-tillage (NT), reduced tillage (RT) and conventional tillage (CT) and of two cover crops: maize monoculture and maize-mucuna intercrop. Vegetables were grown in the winter and the cover crops in the summer for straw production. The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design with four replications. Soil samples were collected between the crop rows in three layers (0.0-0.05, 0.05-0.10, and 0.10-0.30 m) twice: in October, before planting cover crops for straw, and in July, during vegetable cultivation. The total organic carbon (TOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), oxidizable fractions, and the carbon fractions fulvic acid (CFA), humic acid (CHA) and humin (CHUM) were determined. The main changes in these properties occurred in the upper layers (0.0-0.05 and 0.05-0.10 m) where, in general, TOC levels were highest in NT with maize straw. The MBC levels were lowest in CT systems, indicating sensitivity to soil disturbance. Under mucuna, the levels of CHA were lower in RT than NT systems, while the CFA levels were lower in RT than CT. For vegetable production, the CHUM values were lowest in the 0.05-0.10 m layer under CT. With regard to the oxidizable fractions, the tillage systems differed only in the most labile C fractions, with higher levels in NT than CT in the 0.0-0.05 m layer in both summer and winter, with no differences between these systems in the other layers.

However, it is hard to obtain a stable production of soybean with this system, since soybean plants grow under shading by corn; the stems are thinner and susceptible to lodging. We examined the effects of seed treatment with uniconazole powder (0, 2,4 and 8 mg kg(-1) seed) on the growth of soybean seedlings under relay strip intercropping, some morphological characteristics and yield. The seedling height, first internode length, cotyledonary node height and leaf area per plant were decreased, while the stem diameter, root dry weight, shoot dry weight, root volume, leaf greenness and root to shoot dry weight ratio were increased by uniconazole treatment. The root vigor and root active absorption area were also increased significantly by uniconazole treatment. Moreover, 2 and 4 mg kg(-1) uniconazole powder treatment increased shoot dry weight, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod and seed yield significantly. Thus, the results suggested that seed treatment with uniconazole powder at a suitable concentration can improve soybean seedling growth, resist the lodging and also increase the seed yield under shading by corn in relay strip intercropping system."

Moench] is a potential crop for organic production that could help meet the demand increase in organic food products and feed grains, but no efforts have been made to improve sorghum breeding tools, techniques, and methods for this cropping system. Based on revelations in other crops, focal traits and their prioritization to optimize sorghum for organic use likely differs from conventional sorghum breeding targets. This study evaluated yield performance, agronomic characteristics, and biotic stress resistance under certified organic practices in a range of grain sorghum genotypes that included 70 hybrids, 72 advanced breeding lines, and 43 diverse accessions, as well as 10 sweet sorghum cultivars and four commercial maize hybrids. Multiyear, multilocation trial data demonstrated that sorghum can be effectively produced using sustainable and organic inputs, but hybrid or cultivar selection is extremely important for success as entry means for grain yield ranged from 26 to 5,970 kg ha(-1). Yields of top sorghum entries rivaled commercially available maize (Zea mays) hybrids. Overall, hybrids significantly outperformed inbred lines as heterosis proved beneficial for influential agronomic traits, although a Clemson F-6 advanced breeding line, PV20_0426, ranked second in yield. Sugarcane aphid tolerance, increased canopy closure, and grain mold resistance were positively correlated with grain yield and should be considered target traits for breeding sorghum hybrids and cultivars for organic use. Depending on possible seed production constraints, developing pure line cultivars with the proper trait package may be effective to diminish this potential obstacle for the organic sorghum market.

Intercropping of oat and field pea in Alaska: An alternative approach to quality forage production and weed control	ACTA AGRICULTURAE SCANDINAVICA SECTION B-SOIL AND PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						"Alternative weed management; cropping system; forage crops; intercropping; subarctic"	"INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; NITROGEN-FERTILIZER; PERSIAN CLOVER; YIELD; BARLEY; LEGUMES; RYEGRASS; CROPS"	Intercropping of legumes with non-legumes is an ancient crop production method used to improve quality and dry matter (DM) yields of forage and grain, and to control weeds. However, there is little information regarding intercropping at high latitudes. The objectives of this field study were to evaluate performance of (1) sole cropped oat (Avena sativa L.) (cultivars Toral and Calibre) and pea (Pisum sativum L.) (cultivars Carneval and Orb) and their intercrop combinations, and (2) inter- and sole-crop responses to weeds. The different cropping systems were studied with different weed treatments (weed-free all season long, weed-free until flowering, and left weedy all season long). In general intercrops of oat and pea produced DM (forage) and grain yields similar to sole oat crops and higher than sole pea crops although the difference was not statistically significant. Furthermore, forage quality [ crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF)] was improved by intercropping. Most of the variables measured were unaffected by weed treatments, however weed DM was generally lower in sole oat and oat-pea intercropping than sole pea cropping systems. More than 80% of the weed DM was from common lamb's quarters (Chenopodium album L.). The CP of this weed was higher than oat and pea, and ADF and NDF were equivalent to the sole cropped oat. Thus, including weeds as part of the forage is possible. However, if crops are grown for grain, weeds are likely to produce large numbers of seeds that would enter the seed bank. Thus, pea-oat intercrops show potential as an alternative and sustainable approach for optimum yield and high quality forage and weed control under Alaskan subarctic conditions.	"[Smith, D.

The aim of the present work was to understand these results by analysing intercrop species dynamics for growth, light and N acquisition. A 2-year field experiment was carried out in southwest France with different fertilizer-N levels in order to compare wheat (Triticum turgidum L.) and pea (Pisum sativum L.) grown as sole crops and as an intercrop in a row substitutive design. The advantages of intercropping in low N conditions were due mainly to: (1) better light use (up to 10%), thanks to species dynamic complementarity for leaf area index and height; (2) growth complementarity over time (higher growth rate of wheat until pea flowering and then of pea until wheat flowering); and (3) dynamic complementary N acquisition associated with better wheat N status throughout growth. Disadvantages, underlining poorer complementarity within the intercrop stand, were observed with ample available N in early growth. This induced higher cereal growth during winter, which led to increase interspecies competition by reducing pea light absorption and, consequently, its biomass production."

Pea-barley intercropping for efficient symbiotic N-2-fixation, soil N acquisition and use of other nutrients in European organic cropping systems	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Intercropping; Interspecific competition; Land Equivalent Ratio (LER); N-15-isotope techniques; Nitrogen fixation"	"NITROGEN-FIXATION; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; N-2 FIXATION; GRAIN-YIELD; FIXED N; SULFUR; ABUNDANCE; DYNAMICS; LEGUMES; GROWTH"	Complementarity in acquisition of nitrogen (N) from soil and N-2-fixation within pea and barley intercrops was studied in organic field experiments across Western Europe (Denmark, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy). Spring pea and barley were sown either as sole crops, at the recommended plant density (P100 and B100, respectively) or in replacement (P50B50) or additive (P100B50) intercropping designs, in each of three cropping seasons (2003-2005). Irrespective of site and intercrop design, Land Equivalent Ratios (LER) between 1.4 at flowering and 1.3 at maturity showed that total N recovery was greater in the pea-barley intercrops than in the sole Crops Suggesting a high degree of complementarity over a wide range of growing conditions. Complementarity was partly attributed to greater soil mineral N acquisition by barley, forcing pea to rely more on N-2-fixation. At all sites the proportion of total aboveground pea N that was derived from N-2-fixation was greater when intercropped with barley than when grown as a sole crop. No consistent differences were found between the two intercropping designs. Simultaneously, the accumulation Of Phosphorous (P), potassium (K) and sulphur (S) in Danish and German experiments was 20% higher in the intercrop (P50B50) than in the respective sole crops, possibly influencing general crop yields and thereby competitive ability for other resources. Comparing all sites and seasons, the benefits of organic pea-barley intercropping for N acquisition were highly resilient. It is concluded that pea-barley intercropping is a relevant cropping strategy to adopt when trying to optimize N-2-fixation inputs to the cropping system. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Poggio, SL				Poggio, SL			Structure of weed communities occurring in monoculture and intercropping of field pea and barley	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"competition; intercropping; plant functional traits; species diversity; weed suppression"	"CANOPY; WHEAT; COMPETITION; CROP; PRODUCTIVITY; GERMINATION; DIVERSITY; DORMANCY; YIELDS; SEEDS"	"Weed growth suppression is an explanation of intercropping yield advantage, which can be applied to diminish herbicide use in agriculture. Intercrop effects on weed community structure, nonetheless, have been sparsely studied. The hypothesis that intercrops will produce greater changes in weed community structure than monocultures was therefore postulated. It was concurrently predicted that species diversity of the weed community will be lower in the intercropping than in the monocultures, and that winter- and spring-emerging species in intercrop will be relatively less and more abundant than in monocultures, respectively. Field experiments were carried out at Buenos Aries and Rojas (Argentina) involving monocultures, intercrops of barley and pea, and a control treatment where weeds grew without crops. Effects on weed communities were characterised in terms of growth, species diversity (richness and evenness), and floristic and functional composition. Nitrogen content of plant biomass and interception of solar radiation were also measured. The greater the crop biomass, the higher the weed suppression was. However, barley tended to greatly suppress the growth of weed and pea plants, which could be explained by the greater nitrogen accumulation in barley plants in monocultures and intercrops. Furthermore, there were apparent complementarity in nitrogen uptake between barley and pea when intercropped, since both crops use different sources of soil nitrogen. Intercrops and barley monocultures generally produced similar effects on the companion weed communities, whereas pea effects were less suppressive and more variable. However, intercrops effects appeared to be more stable across experiments. Spring-emerging species generally increased its relative importance in the intercrop weed communities; whereas winter-emerging species were usually less abundant in intercrops. Divergence in the abundance of winter and summer emerging weeds could be attributed to the different canopy dynamics of intercrop and monocultures.

(a nonhost plant), planted between soybean rows. Each employed the same planting density and dispersion of a potato leafhopper host plant, soybean: Glycine max (L.) Merrill. The cropping systems formed a gradient of vegetational diversity of host/nonhost plant density. Soybean and wheat were co-present in experimental plots early in the season: following the wheat han est, all four cropping systems were soybean monocultures, Preceding the wheat harvest, potato leafhoppers were substantially and significantly more abundant in the monoculture than in any of the intercropping systems. Leafhopper densities were extremely low in all the intercropping systems. After the wheat harvest, differences between the monoculture and intercropping systems gradually decreased, and fewer collection dates showed significant differences. Females and males had similar population dynamics and differences among cropping systems, No significant differences in abundance were found among the intercropping systems. Results suggest that the use of host/ nonhost intercropping systems would provide growers with all alternative management tactic against potato leafhoppers."

Hill as revealed by intercropping-induced modifications of the rhizosphere microbiome	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						"Hyperaccumulator; Intercropping; Microbiome; RNA-Seq; Sonchus asper; Zea mays"	"HEAVY-METAL POLLUTION; ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; DARK SEPTATE ENDOPHYTES; SEDUM-PLUMBIZINCICOLA; CONTAMINATED SOIL; CHINA POLLUTION; PLANTS; PHYTOEXTRACTION; COMMUNITY; CADMIUM"	Intercropping or assistant endophytes promote phytoremediation capacities of hyperaccumulators and enhance their tolerance to heavy metal (HM) stress. Findings from a previous study showed that intercropping the hyperaccumulator Sonchus asper (L.) Hill grown in HM-contaminated soils with maize improved the remediating properties and indicated an excluder-to-hyperaccumulator switched mode of action towards lead. In the current study, RNA-Seq analysis was conducted on Sonchus roots grown under intercropping or monoculture systems to explore the molecular events underlying this shift in lead sequestering strategy. The findings showed that intercropping only slightly affects S. asper transcriptome but significantly affects expression of root-associated microbial genomes. Further, intercropping triggers significant reshaping of endophytic communities associated with a 'root-to-shoot' transition of lead sequestration and improved phytoremediation capacities of S. asper. These findings indicate that accumulator activities of a weed are partially attributed to the root-associated microbiota, and a complex network of plant-microbe-plant interactions shapes the phytoremediation potential of S. asper. Analysis showed that intercropping may significantly change the structure of root-associated communities resulting in novel remediation properties, thus providing a basis for improving phytoremediation practices to restore contaminated soils.

In the CSS soil, pH and soluble Cr decreased whereas soluble Cu, K, Fe, Mn, Mg, Ni and P increased. The RCW treatment enhanced soluble Fe, Mn, and Mg concentrations. After 15 weeks, shoot DW yield and shoot Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Zn, and Mg removals peaked for F. pratensis grown on the CSS soil, with lowest shoot Cr, Ni and Mo concentrations. Holcus lanatus only grew on the CTRL, UNT, and CSS soils and P. lanceolata on the CTRL soil.

Crop succession and split-application of nitrogen effects on common bean yield in short no-tillage system	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						"Economic viability; intercropping; Phaseolus vulgaris L; seed yield; soil cultivation"	"ORGANIC-CARBON; SOIL; MANAGEMENT; IRRIGATION; FERTILIZATION; QUALITY; REGION; GRASS"	Evaluating the effects of crop successions in no-tillage system (NTS) is essential for the correct recommendation of agronomic practices, such as top-dressing nitrogen fertilization. The aim was to evaluate the effect of the crop succession and the splitting of top-dressing N fertilization on the agronomic performance and economic viability of common bean crop. The experiment was conducted in southeastern Brazil for two agricultural seasons in an area under NTS, using a split-plot in randomized complete block design. The plots represented three cropping successions (maize in sole crop, maize intercropped with Urochloa ruziziensis and U. ruziziensis in sole crop) and the subplots composed of ten combinations of splitting of top-dressing N, at the stages V-3, V-4 and R-5 of the common bean crop. In relation to the single application of the N dose of 90 kg ha(-1), the common bean had higher response as a function of the N splitting schemes adopted, regardless of the previous cropping succession. The cropping successions evaluated did not interfere with the seed yield of common bean as subsequent crop, even at the beginning of the establishment of NTS. To obtain higher seed yield and economic viability, the N dose of 90 kg ha(-1) indicated for the crop must be split and applied among the phenological stages V-3, V-4 and R-5.	"[Mingotte, F. L.

The results showed that compared with cucumber monoculture, intercropping with wheat increased the content of soluble protein, nitrate nitrogen, free amino acid and proline and enhanced the activity of nitrate reductase (NR), glutamine synthase (GS), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and glutamate synthase (GOGAT) of cucumber leaves. The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that compared with cucumber monoculture, the expression of N1, N2 and N3, which belong to NRT (Nitrate Transporter Protein) family and Al, which belong to AMT (Ammonium Transporter Protein) family and GS1 (cytosolic glutamine synthase gene) were up-regulated in intercropped cucumber. In short, the cultivation mode of intercropping with wheat increased the content of nitrogen compounds and enzyme activity and promoted the expression of genes related to nitrogen metabolism in cucumber leaves, which delayed the senescence of cucumber leaves.

Kurozukin is the early maturing cultivar for vegetable soybean harvest and Tanbaguro is the late-maturing cultivar for the harvest of vegetable soybean and seeds. The yield of the first crop (Kurozukin) was similar to the mono cropping regardless of cropping patterns. However, the yield of the second crop (Tanbaguro) was affected by cropping patterns. The yield of Tanbaguro in double cropping was prone to decrease by late sowing. The late sowing was induced by the late sowing and late harvesting of Kurozukin because of the low temperature in April and the large amount of precipitation in rainy season, respectively. In relay intercropping that Tanbaguro was sown between the rows of Kurozukin at about one month before the harvest of Kurozukin, the yield of Tanbaguro was similar to the mono cropping and the competition with Kurozukin was not observed. Thus, the land equivalent ratio value of double cropping was lower than that of relay intercropping. These results suggest that relay intercropping is more useful cultivation system than double cropping to increase the annual soybean production.

The experiment included eighteen treatments which were the combinations between three applied irrigation water (75, 100 and 125% of the recommended applied water) and six cropping systems (2 intercropping systems: 100% corn with 50 and 100% soybean plants) and 2 solid plants of corn and soybean which were grown on beds, compared to 2 solid plantings, as traditional on ridges. The experimental design was split plot design with four replications. The data indicated that soybean seed yields per plant and per ha were reduced significantly by intercropping with corn. Than solid plantings, increasing soybean plant density at intercropping unit area from 50 to 100% as that of solid culture achieved high seed yield without any significant reduction on corn grain yield. Also, corn yield was not affected significantly by cropping systems Each of applied level irrigation water and the interaction between applied irrigation water and cropping systems did not affect soybean seed yield; but the converse was true for corn. Corn yield was increased significantly by raising applied water from 75 to 125%. Corn yield was increased significantly with high level of applied irrigation water, but it was not affected with solid systems. Land equivalent ratios (LERs) were not affected significantly by applied levels of irrigation water but the converse were true for cropping systems and the interaction between previous factors. LERs of intercropping culture ranged between 1.39 and 1.52 as compared to solid plantings (1.0). Water use efficiency (WUE) was increased by decreasing applied irrigation water levels from 125 to 75% of recommended irrigation water level.

Pasture (sward height, herbage allowance, herbage mass, stocking rate and post grazing herbage mass) and soybean (initial stand of plants and yield) attributes were evaluated. The observed sward heights were very similar to those previously intended. There was a linear increase in herbage allowance and herbage mass with increasing sward height management. Forage accumulation rate was not influenced by treatments. Stocking rate decreased linearly with increasing sward height. Post grazing herbage mass increased with increasing sward height.

The pots were separated into two compartments by (i) a solid root barrier to eliminate root contact and solute movement, or (ii) a nylon mesh (30 mum) to prevent root contact but permit solute exchange, or (iii) were not separated into compartments. Wheat plants were grown in one compartment and chickpea in the other. Two P sources, sodium phytate and FePO4, were tested at 60 mug P g(-1) soil. Compared to supplying phytate, supplying FePO4 increased concentrations and contents of Ca, Mg, Mn and Zn in wheat and chickpea, and of Fe in chickpea only. When supplied with phytate, intermingling of root systems of the two species increased the content of Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn and Zn in wheat, but reduced the content of Ca, Mg, Fe and Zn in chickpea. When supplied with FePO4, root intermingling enhanced the content of Ca, Fe and Zn in wheat, but did not affect the content of Ca, Fe and Zn in chickpea. It is concluded that interspecific root interactions and the form of P supply affect the content of Ca, Fe and Zn in both species. Possible mechanisms involved are discussed.

The experimental design was split plot, using randomized complete block design with three replications. The factors included were, main factors: unfertilized (F-1), 100% fertilizer (F-2), 100% manure (F-3), 50% fertilizer + 50% manure (F-4) and five sub factors: sole crop of millet (I-1), 75% millet + 25% bean (I-2), 50% millet + 50% bean (I-3), 25% millet + 75% bean (I-4) and sole crop of bean (I-5). The plants were planted as replacement method. The results showed that the lowest dry matter for crops and total dry matter of weeds was achieved from 50% fertilizer + 50% manure treatment. Also, the highest total dry matter of millet and bean was obtained from this treatment. The highest dry matter of millet and bean was obtained from the sole crop of millet and bean. Further, the highest total dry matter of millet and bean was achieved from the intercropping treatments. The land equivalent ratio (LER) for most of the intercropping treatments was greater than one which indicated that intercropping had advantage over sole crop. Comparing the performance of sole crop and intercrop treatments, the results indicated that intercropping combinations were more advantageous in terms of weed control.

Bulk soils were collected from 0 to 20 cm depth at three sites: a 21-year old pecan (Carya illinoinensis)/bluegrass (Poa trivialis) intercrop (Pecan site) in north-central Missouri, a 12-year old silver maple (Acer saccharinum)/soybean (Glycine may)-maize (Zea mays) rotation (Maple site) in northeastern Missouri and a restored prairie site (MDC site) in southwestern Missouri. Seven tree and crop litters with varying composition were collected, including pecan, silver maple, chestnut and walnut leaf litter (tree litter) and maize, soybean and bluegrass residues (crop litter). Aerobic microcosm incubations were maintained at 25 degrees C and a soil water potential of -47 kPa. Unamended MDC soil mineralized 24 and 18% more CO2 than the Pecan and Maple soils, respectively. Soil amended with crop litter mineralized on average 32% more CO, than when amended with tree litter. Net N mineralization from soybean litter was 40 mg kg(-1), while all other litter immobilized N for various durations. A double pool and a single pool model best described C and N mineralization from amended soils, respectively. Cumulative CO2 mineralized, labile C fraction (CI) and potentially mineralizable C (C-0) were correlated to litter total N and lignin contents and to (lignin + polyphenol):N ratio. In the field, bluegrass litter decomposed and released N twice as fast as pecan leaf litter. Soybean, maize and silver maple litter released 84, 75 and 63% of initial N, respectively, 308 days after field placement, while no differences in mass loss was observed among the three litter materials. At the Maple site, mass and N remaining, 308 days after field placement was lower at the middle of the alley, corresponding to higher soil temperature and water content. No differences in mass loss and N release patterns were observed at the Pecan site. Microclimate and litter quality effects can lead to differences in nutrient availability in alley cropping systems.

However, to increase the comprehensive production benefits of agricultural cultivation and increase the economic benefits of cotton in Northwest Shandong Province, a set of green, ecological, and efficient intercropping mode suitable for Northwest Shandong Province was preliminarily formed. A 2-year intercropping experiment was conducted in Xiajin and Dongping counties in Shandong Province, with six alternative intercropping patterns proposed. After analyzing the experimental data, it was determined that the traditional cotton-peanut intercropping method is not mechanized and that a new intercropping mode has been proposed: four rows of cotton and six rows of peanut. We selected the appropriate intercropping mode for Xiajin and Dongping counties. The production efficiency of 4:4 cotton intercropping in Peanut Ridge was the best in Dongping and Xiajin counties, which was 28-123% higher than that of monoculture. This planting pattern is suitable for demonstration and promotion in the two counties, as well as in the traditional cotton area of the old Yellow River in Northwest Shandong.

J	"Zuo, YM; Zhang, FS"				"Zuo, Yuanmei; Zhang, Fusuo"			Soil and crop management strategies to prevent iron deficiency in crops	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						"Improved iron nutrition; Soil management; Crop management; Integrated and optimized strategies"	"ENHANCED TOLERANCE; PEANUT PLANTS; WATER CONTENT; RICE; FE; ACQUISITION; NUTRITION; GROWTH; ZINC; MECHANISMS"	Plants and humans cannot easily acquire iron from their nutrient sources although it is abundant in nature. Thus, iron deficiency is one of the major limiting factors affecting crop yields, food quality and human nutrition. Therefore, approaches need to be developed to increase Fe uptake by roots, transfer to edible plant portions and absorption by humans from plant food sources. Integrated strategies for soil and crop management are attractive not only for improving growing conditions for crops but also for exploiting a plant's potential for Fe mobilization and utilization. Recent research progress in soil and crop management has provided the means to resolve complex plant Fe nutritional problems through manipulating the rhizosphere (e.g., rhizosphere fertilization and water regulation), and crop management (includes managing cropping systems and screening for Fe efficient species and varieties). Some simple and effective soil management practices, termed 'rhizosphere fertilization' (such as root feeding and bag fertilization) have been developed and widely used by local farmers in China to improve the Fe nutrition of fruit plants. Production practices for rice cultivation are shifting from paddy-rice to aerobic rice to make more efficient use of irrigation water. This shift has brought about increases in Fe deficiency in rice, a new challenge depressing iron availability in rice and reducing Fe supplies to humans. Current crop management strategies addressing Fe deficiency include Fe foliar application, trunk injection, plant breeding for enriched Fe crop species and varieties, and selection of cropping systems. Managing cropping systems, such as intercropping strategies may have numerous advantages in terms of increasing Fe availability to plants. Studies of intercropping systems on peanut/maize, wheat/chickpea and guava/sorghum or -maize increased Fe content of crops and their seed, which suggests that a reasonable intercropping system of iron-efficient species could prevent or mitigate Fe deficiency in Fe-inefficient plants. This review provides a comprehensive comparison of the strategies that have been developed to address Fe deficiency and discusses the most recent advance in soil and crop management to improve the Fe nutrition of crops. These proofs of concept studies will serve as the basis for future Fe research and for integrated and optimized management strategies to alleviate Fe deficiency in farmers' fields.

Alternative management approaches for sugarcane fields have great potential to help mitigate these problems in China. We hypothesized that soybean intercropping with reduced nitrogen input could increase crop productiv-ity and reduce the carbon footprint (CF) of sugarcane fields in China. Therefore, a long-term field experiment from 2009 to 2017 in the Pearl River Delta of China was chosen to test this hypothesis. The results showed that the energy yields of sugarcane/soybean intercropping systems were 17.8%-39.4% higher than those of sug-arcane monocropping systems. The energy yields of the same cropping systems using conventional and reduced N inputs (525 kg ha(-1) and 300 kg ha(-1)) did not show a significant difference. Additionally, the CF values of the unit yield (CFy) for sugarcane/soybean intercropping were 3.2%-30.4% lower than those of the monocropping systems, showing the higher CF efficiency of the intercropping pattern, although the difference was not significant. The CF of the unit area (CF gamma) and the CFy of all the cropping patterns at the conventional N level were 19.5%-62.0% higher than that at the reduced N level, demonstrating that reducing the nitrogen input could significantly lower the CF of the sugarcane fields. In addition, the high N level cased negative effects in terms of increasing the crop productivity and reducing the CF of the soybean/sugarcane intercropping pattern. In condusion, sugarcane/soybean intercropping with reduced N input improved crop productivity while lowering the CF of sugarcane fields in China. The sugarcane/soybean (1:2) intercropping with 300 kg N ha(-1) system showed the best benefits in the Pearl River Delta of China. These advanced agricultural practices contributed to improved farmland use efficiency and clean production in an agricultural system. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Pea-barley intercropping and short-term subsequent crop effects across European organic cropping conditions	NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						"Preceding crop; Pisum sativum L.; Hordeum vulgare L.; N-balance; Subsequent crop"	"SOUTH-EASTERN AUSTRALIA; N-2 FIXATION; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; SOIL TILLAGE; INORGANIC N; CATCH CROP; FIELD PEA; FIXED N; NITROGEN; SYSTEMS"	Grain legumes are known to increase the soil mineral nitrogen (N) content, reduce the infection pressure of soil borne pathogens, and hence enhance subsequent cereals yields. Replicated field experiments were performed throughout W. Europe (Denmark, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy) to asses the effect of intercropping pea and barley on the N supply to subsequent wheat in organic cropping systems. Pea and barley were grown either as sole crops at the recommended plant density (P100 and B100, respectively) or in replacement (P50B50) or additive (P100B50) intercropping designs. In the replacement design the total relative plant density is kept constant, while the additive design uses the optimal sole crop density for pea supplementing with 'extra' barley plants. The pea and barley crops were followed by winter wheat with and without N application. Additional experiments in Denmark and the United Kingdom included subsequent spring wheat with grass-clover as catch crops. The experiment was repeated over the three cropping seasons of 2003, 2004 and 2005. Irrespective of sites and intercrop design pea-barley intercropping improved the plant resource utilization (water, light, nutrients) to grain N yield with 25-30% using the Land Equivalent ratio. In terms of absolute quantities, sole cropped pea accumulated more N in the grains as compared to the additive design followed by the replacement design and then sole cropped barley. The post harvest soil mineral N content was unaffected by the preceding crops. Under the following winter wheat, the lowest mineral N content was generally found in early spring. Variation in soil mineral N content under the winter wheat between sites and seasons indicated a greater influence of regional climatic conditions and long-term cropping history than annual preceding crop and residue quality. Just as with the soil mineral N, the subsequent crop response to preceding crop was negligible. Soil N balances showed general negative values in the 2-year period, indicating depletion of N independent of preceding crop and cropping strategy. It is recommended to develop more rotational approaches to determine subsequent crop effects in organic cropping systems, since preceding crop effects, especially when including legumes, can occur over several years of cropping.

Asparagus exerts a particularly strong influence on its soil environment through abundant production of persistent phenolic acids, which impact selectively soil microorganisms and may be involved in Fusarium crown and root rot (FCRR) of asparagus. In a survey of 50 asparagus plantations of the province of Quebec, we found that FCRR was associated with a profound cultivar-specific, reorganization of the soil microbial community, as revealed by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiling. According to PLFA indicators, microbial biodiversity as well as bacterial and fungal abundance dropped sharply with the onset of FCRR in fields planted with the cultivar Guelph Millenium. This drop was followed by a similar drop in the arbuscular mycorrhizal population. Biodiversity and microbial population size then increased to finally reach a new equilibrium. Discriminant analysis of PLFA profiles obtained from soil samples also indicated a shift in soil microbial community structure associated with FCRR development in fields planted with the cultivar Jersey Giant. Different soil biological conditions, as indicated by microbial biomass C and N and soil enzyme activities, were associated with different cultivars. Preceding crop, manure application, geographical location and tillage depth also influenced the structure of soil microbial communities in asparagus plantations, as determined by PLFA profiling. If higher FCRR incidence is a consequence of the soil microbial community reorganization, means to reduce FCRR incidence in asparagus plantations may be found among practices such as soil organic fertilization, soil tillage and intercropping strategies that would dilute the negative influence of asparagus on the soil microbial community. Finally, FCRR outbreaks were generally promoted by a previous crop of maize. It seems that maize and asparagus host a F. proliferatum teleomorph (Gibberella fujikoroi) of the same mating type.

The purpose of this experiment was to quantify the C and N flows returned within and transported out of plots and crop yields of different cropping systems. Cassava-based systems were not stable and yields declined over time. Intercropping cassava with rice increased cassava fresh tuber weight by 5-48% compared to the monocropping system. The hedgerow intercropping gave lower maize, rice, groundnut and cowpea yields than could be obtained in a crop rotation with legume cover crops. Maize grain yields in the 80-20 rice/maize mixture were about 0.4 Mg ha(-1) in the rice - groundnut rotation and about half as much when intercropped with cassava or hedgerows. Rice yields intercropped with cassava or with hedgerows were about 1 Mg ha(-1) less in year 2 and 3 than those grown in rotation with groundnut. The rice yield in the first cropping season was only about 1 Mg ha(-1), but in the second and third year yields in the rice - legume rotation increased to around 2 and around 3 Mg ha(-1), respectively. This increase occurred despite a decline in soil organic matter content. The cassava-based systems removed much more C (7 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) than the other systems, while less was returned (about 0.5-2 Mg ha(-1)) to the soil. In the hedgerow intercropping system about 2.5 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) was returned to the plot as biomass pruning and crop residues and about 1.5 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) was removed from the plot as yield. In the cover crop rotation 2.6 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) of C was returned to the plot as crop residues plus Mucuna (only the 2nd year) and Cowpea biomass, and about 1.1 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) was removed from the plot. The hedgerow intercropping systems gave an N surplus of about 15-50 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) returned to the soil; while the balance was 10-20 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for the cover crop rotation systems and the cassava-based systems showed a negative N budget of about 60 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)."

Evaluation of some Soil Quality Indices under Two Soil Tillage Systems in a Tropical Region of South East Mexico	AMA-AGRICULTURAL MECHANIZATION IN ASIA AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA			English	Article								"A five year field experiment was conducted to assess the interaction between soil tillage levels, maize-sorghum-legume rotation and two levels of chemical fertilization at the rain feed tropical region of southeast Mexico. The purpose of this research work was to asses this interaction over the variation of some soil quality indices and the effect on the productivity of the soil-grain yield. The treatments for soil tillage were zero till and the intensive traditional soil tillage of the region. Crop rotations employed were five years maize (mmmmm), five years sorghum (sssss), two rotations; (smsms) and (msmsm) and two intercropping of legumes (f)-cereals, (fsfsf) and (fmsmf). Ninety two and 136 units of nitrogen were the two levels of fertilization and were applied only to the cereals. The evaluated soil index in the first and fifth year were organic matter (mo), water infiltration rate (ir), aggregate stability (as), ph, biomass microbiana (mb), nitrogen soluble nitrogen, soil density (sd), soil depth (sd), electrical conductivity (ec) and availability of nutrients. In general terms, the best grain yield for both sorghum and maize were obtained with the no till treatment although no big differences were observed between them. The five year sorghum mean yield under no till with fertilization levels 1 and 2 were 3.6 and 4.5 Mg/ha, whereas, with conventional tillage these were just 3.1 and 4.1 Mg/ha, respectively. The grain yield of maize with level 2 of nitrogen, with zero and traditional till were 5.1 and 4.6 Mg/ha; however, with nitrogen level 1 there were no apparent advantages of the first treatment (3.8 Mg/ha in both cases). The type of crop rotation and soil tillage level mainly affected the chemical soil index at 0 to 5 cm depth. However, no effect occurred with the way of handling crop residues and with the levels of chemical fertilization. The main values of electrical conductivity were attributed to an increase in the solubility of some elements. It was also observed that, under no till, there was an increase of the levels of soluble carbon."	"[Campos-Magana, S.

In this study, soil samples from 10 to 20 cm depth of intercropping Pinto peanut in litchi orchard and litchi monoculture mode were established to determine soil attributes, enzyme activities, as well as the effect on soil bacterial diversity. On this basis, 16S rRNA V4-V5 region of soil bacterial communities in litchi/Pinto peanut intercropping (LP) mode and litchi monoculture mode (CK) was detected by the Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform. The results showed that the content of available potassium (AK) in LP was significantly higher than that in CK by 138.9%, and the content of available nitrogen (AN) in LP was significantly lower than that in CK by 19.6%. The soil enzyme activities were higher in LP as a whole, especially sucrase (SC) and acid protease (PT) were significantly higher by 154.4 and 76.5%, respectively. The absolute abundance and alpha diversity of soil microbiota were significantly higher in the intercropping group. Most importantly, endemic species with a significant difference in LP was higher by ~60 times compared to CK treatment. In the aspect of soil bacterial community structure, the dominant phyla of the two groups were Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Actinobacteria. At the genus level, the absolute abundance of Flavobacterium and Nitrososphaera was significantly higher by 79.20 and 72.93%, respectively, while that of Candidatus_Koribacter was significantly lower with an amplitude of 62.24% in LP than in CK. Furthermore, the redundancy analysis (RDA) suggested that AK, which was highly associated with the dominant genera and phyla, is the vitally dominating environmental factors in LP groups, while in CK groups, it is AN and pH. In addition, PICRUSt2 analysis indicated that intercropping improved the metabolic activity of bacteria which can be correlated to the resistance of litchi root systems to soil-borne diseases. Overall, this study is expected to provide a theoretical basis and technical support for the healthy intercropping cultivation of litchi.

From this view, the research was to study the influence of different intercropping and succession in the physical and chemical attributes of a clayey Oxisol in the Cerrado conditions. The experimental design was randomized blocks with treatments: maize seeding spacing of 0.45 m or 0.90 m, intercropped with Xaraes grass or Tanzania grass, followed by fodder pasture maintenance in the area fertilized or not with 250 kg/ha N (split in 5 applications), and succeeded by soybeans. It was determined the chemical and physical soil attributes, mechanical resistance to penetration, gravimetric humidity and stock of carbon of the soil in four periods: before installing the consortia, after the maize harvest, after drying out the pastures and after soybean harvest. The plots with higher dry matter yield were those that resulted in an increase in organic matter content, soil stock of carbon and greater cycling of nutrients from deeper layers. There was no influence of corn spacing on the physical and chemical soil properties. The use of different species simultaneously in the area results in a reduction in the penetration resistance and increase of the porosity of the soil by differential growth of the roots.

This study aims to investigate how intercropping wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and Solanum nigrum L. affects soil bacterial community and cadmium (Cd) absorption in response to Cd-contaminated soil. We compared the concentrations and accumulations of Cd by plants, the activities of soil enzymes and the bacterial community structures of rhizosphere soil in monoculture and intercropping system. Principal component analysis (PCA) ordinations showed that soil bacterial communities were significantly separated by MW and IW, which illustrated intercmpping with Solanum nigrum L. impacted the bacterial community structure of wheat. Firstly, the results showed that the biomass of shoots and roots in intercropped wheat (IW) were significantly decreased by 16.19% and 29.38% compared with monoculture wheat (MW) after 60 days after transplanting (DAT). Secondly, the Cd concentration and accumulation of shoots in IW was higher than MW. The Cd accumulation of IW shoots and roots were increased 12.87% and 0.98%, respectively after 60 days DAT. Besides, the enzymes activity [catalase (CAT), urease (UA) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)] of IW were decreased 35%, 6% and 21%, respectively after 60 days DAT. Finally, the diversity indexes [Abundance-based Coverage Estimator (ACE), Chao and InvSimpson] of IW were lower than MW. These results indicated that intercropping with Solanum nigrum L. inhibited the wheat growth and decreased the bacterial community diversity in wheat rhizosphere, increased the Cd concentration and accumulation in plant tissues of wheat. Therefore, intercropping Solarium nigrum L. and wheat with Cd-contaminated soil might increase the risk of excessive Cd in wheat.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of the green manure crops [Canavalia ensiformis (jack beans), Crotalaria spectabilis (sunn hemp), Pueraria phaseoloides (tropical kudzu), Arachis pintoi (peanut forage) and spontaneous plants] and distance between espaliers on the yields of Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa (passion fruit), Ananas comosus (pineapple), Zea mays (maize), Manihot esculenta (cassava) and biomass in organic polyculture in the state of Acre, Brazil. The randomized block design experiment comprised plots encompassing the space between the rows of passion fruits (espaliers located 3 m or 4 m apart), and subplots that contained the green manure crops. Green biomass yield by jack beans, sunn hemp and tropical kudzu was greater than that provided by peanut forage and spontaneous plants. The polyculture of passion fruit, pineapple, maize and cassava presented a high overall yield (44462 kg ha(-1)). The land-use efficiency of the polyculture system was between 2.45 (with sunn hemp) and 2.77 (with tropical kudzu) times greater than that achieved by individual monocultures. The yields of passion fruit (with tropical kudzu as cover crop) and pineapple (with spontaneous plants as green manure) were enhanced by some 72 and 34%, respectively, when cultivated in plots comprising 3 m-spaced espaliers in comparison with plots containing 4 m-spaced espaliers.

The terminated wheat-cotton system (TWC) utilizes fall rain to grow wheat residue, This system has increased irrigated cotton lint yields compared with continuous clean-tillage cotton (CCC), but there is limited information on the annual water budget and adaptability of TWC under dryland conditions. This study compares CCC and TWC effects on (i) runoff and infiltration of rain, (ii) the annual water balance, and (iii) cotton hint yield under dryland conditions. The water budget of TWC end CCC was measured in 3-by 30-m subplot watersheds from May 1992 to December 1995 on an Amarillo sandy loam (fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Aridic Paleustalf) at Wellman, TX, Compared with CCC plots, the TWC residue reduced average annual runoff by 43 mm, but increased average fallow water use by 28 mm (tor growing wheat), The use of TWC did not significantly (P = 0.05) increase either water conservation or cotton lint yields compared with CCC. Cotton establishment was problematic due to limited soil water at planting in 1993 for TWC and CCC. This prevented 1994 TWC cotton establishment, thus offsetting improved establishment in 1992, when residue protected cotton seedlings during above-average rain. In semiarid regions, inadequate soil water for crop establishment is an uncontrolled risk with dryland TWC production. Because no significant gains in mater storage or cotton lint yield were observed under dryland conditions with TWC compared with CCC, undertaking the greater crop establishment risk with TWC cotton production is not recommended in the Tex-as South Plains.

A two-year field experiment was carried out to investigate the yield advantage of intercropping peanut (Arachis hypogaea L., Zhenyuanza 9102) and rice (Oryza sativa L., Wuyujing 99-15) in aerobic soil, and its effect on soil nitrogen (N) fertility. A pot experiment was also conducted to examine the N-2-fixation by peanut and N transfer from peanut to rice at three N fertilizer application rates, i.e., 15, 75 and 150 kg N ha(-1) using a N-15 isotope dilution method. The results showed that the relative advantage of intercropping, expressed as land equivalent ratio (LER), was 1.41 in 2001 and 1.36 in 2002. Both area-adjusted yield and N content of rice were significantly increased in the intercropping system while those of peanut were not significantly different between intercropping and monocropping systems. The yields of rice grain and peanut, for example, were increased by 29-37% and 47% in the intercropping system when compared to the crop grown in the monocropping system. The intercropping advantage was mainly due to the sparing effect of soil inorganic N contributed by the peanut. This result was proved by the higher soil mineral N concentration under peanut monocropping and intercropping than under the rice monocropping system.%Ndfa (nitrogen derived from atmosphere) by peanut was 72.8, 56.5 and 35.4% under monocropping and 76.1, 53.3 and 50.7% under the intercropping system at N fertilizer application rates of 15, 75 and 150 kg ha(-1), respectively. The N-15-based estimates of N transfer from peanut (%NTFL) was 12.2, 9.2 and 6.2% at the three N fertilizer application rates. N transferred from peanut accounted for 11.9, 6.4 and 5.5% of the total N accumulated in the rice plants in intercropping at the same three N fertilizer application rates, suggesting that the transferred N from peanut in the intercropping system made a contribution to the N nutrition of rice, especially in low-N soil.

Crops and crop combinations in system 1 were oat-vetch, wheat-trifolium, teff straw, and cowpea. System 2 was similar to system 1 except that maize-lablab replaced wheat-trifolium. Neither grain yields nor yields of straws or hays were affected by intercropping. Grain and straw yields were about 25% higher than yields reported for small holder systems. Using the standard measures of quality such as crude protein, neutral-detergent fibre, and acid-detergent lignin, the presence of legumes in crop mixtures improved forage quality resulting in higher degradation characteristics than would be expected from cereals alone.

The data token from these farms show that in the period from 1980/81 to 1995/96 nor only the dairy farming but also food production had to adapt to changing circumstances. Besides the agri-political interventions like the regulation of the quantity of milk (1983, 1988) and the reform of agricultural policy (1993), the farms had to react to sustained chainges of price and price relations for means of production. The analysed dairy farms obtained an increase of capacity per cow of about 1000 kg. At the same time the milk yield produced by roughage was raised about 1200 kg. This increase of efficiency got possible especially by the clear improvement of the quality of the home grown fodder. The development of food production is characterised by turning away from intercropping, a transition to a higher frequency of cuttings for grassilage and an increase of maize silage. The CAP reform has shifted price relations in favour of concentrates and maize silage. Dairy farmers will use these new price relations and continually adapt feeding in order nor to endanger the reached level of productivity. The price advantage for maize silage can in long terms result in suspending grass silage. There will be disadvantages of locations for grassland regions. In the meantime byproducts of industrial food production (as sugar beet pulp, brewers grains) have reached a share of 5% of the total amount of home grown fodder.

J	David, F				David, Fernand			Expansion of green alder (Alnus alnobetula [Ehrh] K. Koch) in the northern French Alps: A palaeoecological point of view	COMPTES RENDUS BIOLOGIES			English	Article						"French North-Western Alps; Holocene vegetation history; Green alder; Human impact; Deforestation; Bronze-Iron Age"	"AGE CALIBRATION; VEGETATION"	Pollen analyses were undertaken on a small peat bog (Ecuelles 06 degrees 49' 41E, 45 degrees 58' 49N, 1855 m asl), located on the Anterne mountain (Upper-Arve Valley, French north-western Alps). The study highlights the role of green alder (Alnus alnobetula [Ehrh] K. Koch) in Holocene vegetation dynamics of the nowadays treeless subalpine belt. At this place, the onset of human perturbation caused a retreat of fir and arolla-pine stands and an expansion of green alder, which consequently dominated the landscape from 3700 up to 1965 cal. BP. After 1965 cal. BP, the clearings led to the present grasslands with few ligneous species (spruce, larch) on inaccessible cliffs or green alder on the edges of torrents or in avalanche corridors. Picea percentages have increased after 3900 cal. BP, but, due to human activities, spruce has never constituted large stands in the study area. The present general expansion of green alder is due to the decreasing human impact and it constitutes the first step of re-afforestation that should lead to mixed stands of spruce and arolla-pine. The study gives a new evidence of the past diversity of the vegetation cover and do not support the idea that green alder colonization at the subalpine belt constitutes a long-term risk for the vegetation diversity.

Experiment was conducted to evaluate effect of corn-soybean combinations of 75:25, 50:50 and 25:75 in addition to monocrops of corn and soybean to detrernifie forage dry matter (DM) yield and quality in corn-soybean intercropping. The crop combination ratio had significant effects on dry matter yield and nutritive quality of forage. The ratio of 75:25 and 50:50 recorded DM yields similar to those of monocropped corn (14.77 t/ha). Forage quality in terms of crude protein (CP) (75:25 ratio 12.75%, 50:50 ratio 13.73% and 25:75 ratio 14.68%) was improved by intercropping due to higher nitrogen availability for corn in intercropping compared with its sole crop (10.83% CP). Increase ratio of corn in corn-soybean mixture, negatively affectd neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF) of forage and declined with increasing ratio of soybean plants. Combination ratio of 50:50 gave higher protein yield (1886.45 kg/ha) than other crop combination ratio.

In a 3-year field experiment competition behaviour of component crops for nutrients use in soybean/pigeonpea intercropping system was assessed based on relative yield (RY), relative nitrogen yield (RNY) and relative phosphorus yield (RPY) under three nutrient levels (0 NPK, 100% NPK (N:P:K = 30:26:25 kg ha(-1)) and 100% NPK + 4 t FYM ha(-1)). The result showed that before soybean harvest, the RY and RNY of soybean were greater (1.0) than the corresponding values of RY and RNY of pigeon pea (0.6). This implied that competition exists for soil N between the component crops during the first half of the cropping system. It was observed that soybean harvest did not coincide with peak flowering of pigeonpea, the stage when biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) was maximum. Thus, BNF dependency of pigeonpea was low before soybean harvest and the plants suffered from N deficiency more when no fertilizer-N was applied and diminished at a high-N level. Pigeon pea attained its peak flowering after the harvest of soybean and increased its dependency on BNF when soil N was exhausted by soybean. Thus, after the harvest of soybean, RY and RNY of pigeon pea gradually increased and approached 1.0 at maturity at all nutrient levels. The RPY values showed that phosphorus was not the limiting factor to any of the crop in the system even if it was not applied. The study thus suggests that in the soybean/pigeonpea intercropping system, N is a limiting factor for growth of pigeonpea intercrop during the first half of its growth and application of 100% NPK (30 kg N) + 4 t FYM could meet N demand of pigeonpea in N deficient soils as this nutrient management option gave higher yield, root length density and profit under soybean/pigeonpea intercropping system than 100% NPK and control.

Intercropping against onion thrips, Thrips tabaci Lindeman (Thysanoptera : Thripidae) in onion production: on the suitability of orchard grass, lacy phacelia, and buckwheat as alternatives for white clover	JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION			English	Article						"intercropping; IPM; onion; onion thrips; Thrips tabaci"	"LEEK; CROP; YIELD; MAIZE"	During 2004 and 2005, field experiments were done to compare the effectiveness of four different intercrops in reducing onion thrips (Thrips tabaci Lindeman) damage on onion plants. The four intercrops were lacy phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia Benth.), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench.), orchard grass (Dartylis glomerata L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.). The experiment was done in a fertile soil in 2004 and a relatively infertile soil in 2005. In both years, the thrips population was lower than expected due to two cold springs and wet summers. The amount of damage on the two onion varieties tested, 'Rdeci baron' and 'Holandska rumena', exceeded the 20% leaf damage threshold only on some onion plants. In both years, white clover was the least attractive intercrop for onion thrips, and orchard grass was only slightly more attractive. Although the damage to the onion leaves was the highest in these two intercrops, these plots still produced the highest yield of onions. In contrast, lacy phacelia and buckwheat were both highly attractive to onion thrips, but were not suitable as intercrops, as they competed too strongly with the onion crop. Hence, lacy phacelia, buckwheat and orchard grass should not be used in onion production to replace white clover, the intercrop used currently. In the current experiments, intercropping with white clover resulted in the highest yield of onions in both high and low fertility soils.

If applied correctly, factors such as nitrogen fertilizer, the mowing phase, and sowing norms can significantly increase the productivity of these mixtures. Field trials were conducted to examine their productivity under different nitrogen levels (0, 40, 80 kg ha(-1)), different sowing norms/mixtures (field peas: oats-100:15%; 100:30%), and two stages of growth (full flowering, full pod formation). Nitrogen fertilizer and different sowing norms had a significant effect on the biomass, hay, and crude protein yields. On average, the highest hay yields were achieved with 80 kg ha(-1) N (4.96 t ha(-1)), followed by 40 kg ha(-1) N (4.27 t ha(-1)). The highest protein yields were achieved with 40 kg ha(-1) N (CP-704.1 kg ha(-1)), followed by 80 kg ha(-1) N (CP-637.6 kg ha(-1)). Sowing norm 100:30% achieved higher hay yields: 100:30%-4.82 t ha(-1); 100:15%-4.44 t ha(-1), while 100:15% achieved higher crude protein yields: 100:15%-730.4 kg ha(-1); 100:30%-692.7 kg ha(-1) on average. The costs were not significantly increased with the nitrogen fertilizer, but the net profits were increased by as much as 163%, depending on the nitrogen level and the mixture. Nitrogen fertilizer also achieves higher economic efficiency for the mixture 100:15% compared to the 100:30% mixture. Mixtures of field peas and oats outperform single-grown crops and provide cost-effective feed for a short time. Using optimal seed ratios and nitrogen fertilizer can significantly increase the productivity and profitability of the feed with minimal impact on the overall production costs."

The aim of this study was to explore how varying nitrogen (N) availability in cropping arrangements of pea (Pisum sativum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) grown as sole crops and intercrops at different fertilization levels and considering different N sources (soil mineralization, N fixation, N fertilizer) affects the response of weed species with differential N responsiveness. Crop and weed biomass were sampled at flowering and maturity. The total N content and N-15 isotope signatures were analyzed to differentiate between N sources and to estimate the amount of N available to weeds. The highly N-responsive weed (Chenopodium album) accumulated more N and biomass than the weed with reduced N responsiveness (Galeopsis spp.). Fertilizer supply favored Chenopodium album, but not the crops. Altered soil N availability caused a shift in the dominance of the nitrophilic weed species towards the highly N-responsive species. This shift in dominance could affect the long-term weed community composition and thus have implications for sustainable weed management.

Sugarcane-legume intercropping may help to regulate the microbial structure and functions. In the present study, sugarcane rhizosphere soils of three cropping systems: Sugarcane only (S-only), sugarcane with peanut (S + P), and sugarcane + soybean (S + S) were sampled in tillering, elongation, and maturation stages from two different experimental fields. High-throughput sequencing technologies applied to assess the effects of different cropping systems on the structure of nitrogenase (nifH) gene communities. A total of 3818 OTUs (operational taxonomic units) were acquired from all soil samples. Intercropping systems noticeably increased the relative abundance ofProteobacteriain the tillering stage. The increased microbial diversity in the rhizosphere was mainly due to soil organic carbon and total soil N. In contrast, intercropping has no significant negative impact on microbial abundance, but sugarcane growth stages influence it significantly, and two bacteria (BradyrhizobiumandPseudacidovorax) showed significant shift during plant growth. The results provide insight into the microbial structure ofProteobacteriain the sugarcane legume-intercropping field, and how microbial community behaves in different growth stages. It can boost the microbial activity of the soil, and that could be a new strategy to stimulate soil fertility without causing any negative impact on crop production.

These field trials investigated the effects of intercropping and the calculation of relative seed frequency in pea-barley mixtures to achieve maximum relative seed and shoot yields, as well as N and S accumulation. Under the given environmental conditions, a high degree of complementarity over a wide range of growing resources achieved relative total seed yields (RYT) of 1.35 and an increased N and S accumulation in the shoot of the mixture of 35% and 29% compared to the means of the pure stands of pea and spring barley. The increased complementarity of S resources (RYT S shoot = 1.29) was obviously a consequence of promoted vegetative growth caused by the increased complementarity of N resources of the cereal-legume mixture. To achieve the maximum seed yield and maximum N and S accumulation in substitutive mixtures of pea and spring barley, a relative seed frequency of 42%-88% pea seeds to 12%-58% spring barley seeds of their monocrop seeding rate has been calculated to be optimal. The availability of N in the soil of the respective environment, quantified by N accumulation in barley shoots, did not influence optimal relative seed frequency of the intercrop.

To this end, a randomized block design with factorial array (3x4x4) and four replications was established. The greatest dry matter yield was obtained from the oat-vetch mixture at the grain doughy stage of maturity (16.6 t ha(-1); P < 0.00), while the seed proportion with the highest production was from the oat-vetch (65: 35) ratio with 19.9 t ha(-1) during the dough grain stage. The highest amount of crude protein was obtained from the oat-vetch (178 g kg(-1) MS) and triticale-vetch (161 g kg(-1) MS) mixtures during booting stage. The monoculture vetch and oats-vetch (35: 65) proportion, both had lower amounts of neutral detergent fiber at the mature grain stage (P<0.001). The oat, vetch and triticale monocultures showed the lowest acid detergent fiber during milky grain stage (P<0.001). The greatest percentage of TDN was observed in vetch monoculture and its mixtures with barley (65: 35) during the milky grain stage, respectively (P<0.001). The monoculture vetch provided highest values for NEL and RFV (P<0.001). In conclusion, the forage yield and quality of vetch mixtures with barley, oat and triticale depend on the maturity stage. Also, the oat-vetch mixture showed the greatest dry matter yield and high CP concentration. In addition, forage relative value was higher during the mature grain stage."

In this work, the objective was to gather empirical field data on the associational resistance of durum wheat-winter pea intercrops towards the pea aphid, compared with pure stands of winter pea. Our results showed that intercropping winter pea with durum wheat significantly decreased A. pisum abundance in all the situations. Moreover, it was systematically observed that pea grew bigger in pure than in intercropped stands but after considering pea dry mass as a covariate, it appeared that the durum wheat-winter pea intercrop was still significantly less attacked by pea aphids than the sole crop. Intercrop sowing designs had an incidence on infestation levels: substitutive diversification systems of different types are more effective in decreasing the level of aphid infestation than does the additive system. In addition, substitutive row intercrop is significantly less infested than substitutive mixture.

This study aims to apply a life cycle assessment (LCA) to ICs by testing several methods of co-product handling to ascertain the environmental impacts of the co-products. Several classic methods of allocation and system expansion were compared, and additional methods were proposed to better analyse the impacts of ICs and sole crops (SCs), taking into account complementarities between species that may provide benefits for each species as well as global benefits compared to the SCs of an equivalent area or production. Unfertilised ICs produce wheat and pea crops that have a lower impact with regards to climate change (CC), acidification (AC), terrestrial ecotoxicity (TE) or cumulative energy demand (CED) than N-fertilised SC wheat (W100 N) and unfertilised SC pea (P100 NO), regardless of the allocation method or functional unit (kg of grains of wheat, of pea, or 1 ha). Unfertilised ICs exhibited a higher and lower eutrophication (EU) impact when compared to W100 N and P100 NO, respectively. Concerning land occupation (10), the results were highly variable depending on the allocation method and either increased or decreased the impact of ICs relative to the impact of SCs. Classic allocation methods strongly affected the results, and system expansion yielded surprising results, emphasising the benefits of interspecific complementarity. We then redefined our functional unit to assess the impact of ICs apart from those of SCs (equivalence of area or production). These comparisons demonstrated that ICs always allowed for a significant decrease in environmental impacts when compared to SCs based on the equivalence of production. Based on the equivalence of crop area, similar trends were observed, except for EU and LO, where there was little difference in impact between ICs and SCs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, knowledge of the effect that low S availability has on the growth dynamics and nitrogen (N) use of cereal-legume intercrops is limited. Pea (Pisum sativum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) were grown in a pot experiment as sole crops and intercrops with or without the addition of S in the form of gypsum. At three consecutive harvests total aboveground biomass and corresponding soil samples were taken for analysis. Harvested biomass was analysed for total S and N content and soil samples for their sulfate content. The cumulative Relative Efficiency Index (REIc) was used to study the interspecies growth, N and S dynamics in the intercrop and the Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) was used to evaluate intercrop performance. In the initial growth phase earlier germination gave barley a growth and nutrient use advantage compared to pea (REIc values < 1). However, shortly after this pioneer phase, the importance of initial size differences decreased relative to the effect of species identity in determining the competitive strength of the two species and by the end of the growth period pea was very dominant (REIc values > 1). The limited availability of soil N played a pivotal role in creating the nutrient and growth dynamics observed in the intercrop and increasing the availability of S did not change this markedly. Most likely as a result of its N-2 fixing ability the pea component came to dominate the intercrop both with respect to yield and nutrient accumulation, accounting for 77% of total dry matter production, 90% of N uptake and 85% of S uptake, averaged across S treatments. LER values calculated on the basis of total aboveground dry matter, and N and S accumulation all exceeded 1, indicating that available growth resources were used more efficiently by the intercrop than the average sole crop.

In a field study barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and pea (Pisum sativum L.) were sole cropped and intercropped at three densities and with two relative frequencies when intercropped. Earlier seedling emergence gave barley an initial growth advantage, assessed using the relative efficiency index (REIc), whereas pea was in general more growth efficient once the initial growth phase had been passed. This reversal in relative growth efficiency along with the observation that early barley dominance did not appear to suppress pea growth indicates that differences in phenology played a role in shaping the prevailing dynamics. Whereas increases in plant density had a positive effect on the growth of pea, the growth of intercropped barley was severely limited by increases in density at the end of the growing period and more so in the pea dominated intercrop. At the final harvest land equivalent ratios (LER) of 0.9-1.2 express resource complementarity in almost all studied intercrops, complementarity that was not directly affected by changes in plant density or relative frequency. Intercropped pea did not increase its reliance on atmospheric nitrogen fixation compared to the pea sole crop. With respect to soil nitrogen uptake there were no effect of plant density but a strong effect of the relative frequency of pea in the intercrop, the greater the proportion the lower the uptake. Changes in the competitive strength of the pea and barley crop over the growing season had a marked effect on the proportion of pea in the final grain yields of the intercrops. At low and recommended density the proportions of pea and barley in the final grain yield was not markedly different from the expected proportions sown; however, at high density the suppression of barley strongly increased the proportion of pea in the final grain yield. Weed infestation levels decreased as density was raised and the suppressing effect of density was clearly stronger the greater the frequency of pea in the crop. Earlier germination and tillering ability of barley are seen as likely explanations of lower weed load in the barley dominated crop treatments."

The first trial comprised canola (Brassica napus L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) in monoculture and three intercrop treatments of canola and barley. The second trial comprised pea (Pisum sativum L.) and barley in monoculture and three intercrop treatments of pea and barley. Treatment had little effect on species richness. For taxa combined, a significant effect of treatment was detected in 3 of 11 cases, reflecting greater captures of beetles in canola or pea than in barley. Captures of individual taxa were compared among canola or pea versus each of the three intercrops versus barley. For 14 of 15 cases showing significant differences between monocultures, more beetles were captured in canola or pea than in barley. For 12 of 14 cases showing significant differences between monocultures and intercrops, captures of beetles were highest in canola or pea. These cases primarily reflected different captures of Amara spp. and Bembidion spp. across treatments. Results show that under the experimental conditions of the current study in Alberta, Canada, intercropping barley into canola or pea did not increase the activity abundance of populations above that observed in the latter two crops.

In this study, we extended previous research by testing the hypotheses that (1) the intercropped field pea fixes a greater proportion of its shoot and root N than does sole-cropped field pea; (2) N is transferred from the annual legume to the cereal during the growing season; and (3) root production is greater under intercropped than sole-cropped conditions. Unconfined microplots seeded to barley, field peas, or a barley-field pea intercrop were fertilized with N at 10 kg ha-1 as (NH4)2SO4 (5.21 atom % N-15 excess). Both the intercropped and sole-cropped barley derived more than 93% of their N from the soil. In contrast, 40% of N in the intercropped field pea was derived from soil. This study provided no evidence for transfer of N from the legume to the cereal. On average, the proportion of N derived from air by both pea intercrops was 39% higher than that derived by the sole-cropped pea. Root length determined by a grid intersection method following digitization using an image analyzer tended to be higher under intercropping than in sole crops. We conclude that even on fertile soils benefits may accrue from annual intercropping that includes a legume. The benefits arise from (1) increased N production, (2) greater N-fixation efficiency, and/or (3) more shoot and root residue-N mineralization for subsequent crops."

It is hypothesized that both intercropping and water-table control could increase N uptake and reduce the quantity of N that might be lost due to leaching. This study compared corn (Zea mays L.) with annual Italian rye-grass (Lolium multiflorum Lam) intercropping and corn monocrop systems under three controlled drainage levels [free drainage (water table 1 m below soil surface), and water-table depths maintained at 0.70 or 0.80 m, below the soil surface via subirrigation]. Annual Italian rye-grass was planted 10 days after the corn was planted. Grain yield, above-ground dry-matter production, N uptake and fertilizer N recovery (FNR) were assessed over 2 years on a fine, silty, mixed, non-acid, frigid Typic Humaquept sandy loam soil. Corn grain yields were unaffected by the annual rye-grass/weed component of the intercropping system or the various water-table depths in either year. Intercropping increased the total above-ground dry-matter production by 3.2 and 2.4 Mg ha(-1) and N uptake by 71 and 49 kg ha(-1) in 1993 and 1994, respectively. Fertilizer N recovery from corn was not different between the two cropping systems. Water table depth had no effect on grain yield and N uptake. Previous published results from the same site indicated decreased soil N-NO3- content in the top 1 m of the soil profile in the fall of 1993 and less denitrification due to intercropping, demonstrating that a corn-annual rye-grass intercropping system, especially with rye-grass establishing well later in the season, may be an effective practice for increasing soil N uptake without reduction of corn grain yield when adequate N and moisture are present.

The experiment compared both corn and soybean as monocultures and in different intercropping ratios from 25:75, 50:50 and 75:25 of corn to soybean. The crop combination ratio had significant effects on physiological traits and dry matter yield of forage. The ratio of 75:25 and 50:50 recorded DM yields similar to those of monocropped corn (14.77 t/ha). Relative yield total (RYT) values of intercropping were higher than that of monocrop corn and soybean. Mixtures with 50:50 combination ratio had higher mean total relative yield values (1.15) in comparison with the other ratios. Land equivalent ratio (LER) increased with corn-soybean intercropping and the highest total LER value was recorded with 50:50 ratio (1.13).

Six peptides were identified as the products of enzymatic hydrolysis by nano liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). One of the six peptides was labeled with radioactive isotope iodine-125 and then purified. The I-125-peptide solution was irrigated to the rhizosphere soil of watermelon seedlings (Citrullus lanatus L.) and wheat seedlings (Triticum aestivum L.), which the two crops usually intercrop with cotton in China. Detection of radioactivity in both plant tissues within one hour proved adsorption, uptake and translocation of the peptide into watermelon and wheat seedlings. Three of the identified peptides were sprayed onto the seedling leaves of watermelon, wheat and maize (Zea mays L.) in the field or the growth chamber. No significant effects on plant growth were observed. These peptides also did not affect growth of organic phosphate-dissolving, nitrogen-fixing, and potassium-dissolving bacteria in the culture. This study provides a new view of GMO risk assessment methodology.

Conservation agriculture for improving water productivity in Vertisols of semi-arid tropics	CURRENT SCIENCE			English	Article						"Conservation agriculture; crop residue; minimum tillage; rainfed agriculture; semi-arid tropics; soil water balance; Vertisols"	"SOIL; TILLAGE; YIELDS; EVAPORATION; MANAGEMENT; SHRINKAGE; SYSTEMS; AFRICA; LOSSES; EAST"	Large variability and uncertainty of rainfall are the main limiting factors for crop growth in rainfed agriculture. Agriculture water management interventions are considered as suitable adoption strategy to enhance crop yield, productivity and income in rainfed condition. Three-year experimental data collected at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, Patancheru, India are analysed to study the impact of in-situ interventions (tillage and crop residue) on field water balance and grain yield under the two different cropping systems (maize + chickpea sequential and maize/pigeon pea intercropping). One dimensional water balance model is calibrated to capture field hydrology (soil water, surface runoff). Weather data calibrated for 36 years showed that incorporating crop residues reduced surface runoff by 28% compared to control fields. However, the impact of tillage and residue treatment on soil water was not consistent throughout the growing period. Water productivity values for intercropping systems (WUE = 0.61 to 1.49 kg m(-3)) were relatively higher compared to sequential cropping systems (WUE = 0.47 to 1.06 kg m(-3)). Second crop in sequential cropping system often suffered from water stress that led to poor crop yield. However, a few rain events at the end of the monsoon period were beneficial to second crop. Simulation results indicated that the conservation agriculture could save up to 30% yield loss incurred due to water stress during deficit rainfall compared to conventional agricultural practices.

This study assessed the fermentation characteristics of forage corn silage (Zea mays L.) (CS) and forage sorghum silage [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] (FS) when mixed with different proportions of lablab bean [Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet] (LB). Corn, FS, and LB were grown in separate fields at two locations in 2009. At each location, crops were cut and chopped separately and taken to the laboratory for ensiling. Six mixtures were handmade on a percentage fresh weight basis for each CS-LB and FS-LB combination, including (i) 100: 0, (ii) 90: 10, (iii) 75: 25, (iv) 50: 50, (v) 25: 75, and (vi) 0:100. For each mixture, a 1-L glass jar (mini-silo) was filled with 500 g of fresh material, with four jars per treatment. Forage in mini-silos was fermented for 60 d at room temperature (25 degrees C). Analysis was conducted for nutritive value and fermentation characteristics. The greatest impact of mixing LB with CS or FS was on crude protein (CP) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) concentrations, with no significant impact on neutral detergent fiber (NDF). Averaging across CS and FS, CP concentration increased from 87 to 173 g kg(-1) and ADF concentration from 253 to 306 g kg(-1) as LB increased from 0 to 75% in the mixture. Increasing LB in the mixture also increased other constituents, such as pH and lactic and acetic acid concentrations. Adding LB to CS or FS for silage can have a positive effect on the final nutritive value, but additional research is needed to assess the impact in cattle.

Treatments included bare soil, common agricultural practice, and a range of soil-conserving practices, including intercrops and hedgerows of Leucaena leucocephala. The presence of a maize crop reduced soil loss but not runoff relative to the bare plot. Addition of hedgerows approximately halved runoff from the steep experimental plots, thereby reducing soil loss, though sediment concentration was similar to the cropped treatment. The addition of an intercrop of peanut further reduced both runoff and sediment concentration in the runoff, thus leading to a substantial reduction in soil loss. The erodibility of a nearby different soil at low slope (10%) was found to be high, but its erodibility appeared to be increased following cultivation.

Production potential and economics of safed musli (Chlorophytum borivilianum) under intercropping system	ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article								A field experiment was conducted for two years, 2004-5 and 2005-6 during July-March at the research farm of the Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow to study the compatibility, productivity and economics of intercropping in safed musli (Chlorophytum borivilianum Santapau & Fernandes). Vegetable crops viz cowpea, okra and bottle gourd, maize for grain, long duration pigeon pea, sweet basil in first year at their full and half population were intercropped with full population of safed musli in additive series. In the second year okra and sweet basil were replaced by lablab bean and sacred basil, respectively. Results of two years' experiments showed that intercropping of pigeon pea and bottle gourd with musli were advantageous in terms of overall yield, land equivalent ratio (LER), monetary advantage and economic return. The most appropriate combinations to realize the maximum advantage from intercropping were half plant population of bottle gourd grown at 100 x 100 cm or 120 x 90 cm spacing and pigeon pea grown at 120 x 20 cm spacing with musli. These combinations gave additional yield of 49.82 t ha(-1) of bottle gourd and 6.51 t ha(-1) grain of pigeon pea (2-year mean) without significantly reducing the root yield of musli.

Despite the well-known advantages of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in cropping systems, less than 10% of the grain crops planted annually in these areas are legumes. Using a participatory research and development approach, resource-poor farmers were introduced to conservation agriculture (CA) practices, including BNF, that promoted zero (or reduced) tillage, increased retention of soil cover, as well as crop diversification. Because crop rotation and intercropping of legumes with cereals are known to contribute to soil fertility while enhancing food security, resource-poor fanners from various Provinces in South Africa were trained on the benefits of legume culture for eight years. As a result, these resource-poor farmers did not only get training in inoculation techniques, but were also supplied with inoculants for use on their farms. Data collected from Farmers Demonstration Trials at Belvedere, Dumbarton and Lusikisiki, showed that the grain and fodder yield of maize planted after legumes, and maize intercropped with legumes, were comparable to those of maize receiving high N fertilizer dose (i.e. 54 kg N at planting and 54 kg N as top-dressing). The same data further showed that Rhizobium inoculation, when combined with application of low levels of P and K. significantly increased crop yields within farmers' trial plots. BNF therefore offers a great opportunity for resource-poor farmers in South Africa to increase their crop yields and thus improve the quality of their livelihoods through the adoption of affordable and sustainable biological technologies that enhance soil fertility.

Striga management and the African farmer	OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE			English	Article						"plant parasites; small-scale farms; Striga; African farmers; African agriculture"		Striga asiatica and S. hermonthica are widespread plant parasites of cereals in Sub-Saharan Africa. In maize cropland alone, Striga has infested about 2.4 million ha, resulting in yield loss of 1.6 million tons per year, valued at US$383 million. Because the parasite attacks below ground, conventional weeding is largely ineffective. Researchers have been slow to develop other Striga control practices useful to small-scale African farmers. Two recent technical breakthroughs, however, offer opportunities for better Striga management. First, herbicide-resistant maize lines provide several weeks' chemical protection from infection, resulting in over one ton per ha yield improvement and reducing Striga expression by 80%. Second, many legumes induce Striga seed to germinate and die in the absence of susceptible host roots, a characteristic usefully employed in cereal-legume intercropping and rotation. The challenge is to translate these technical achievements into Products and technologies available to and adopted by Africa's poor farmers.

N content in rice plant at all the growth stages was significantly higher when it was followed by blackgram as sole and intercrop with maize. Similar trend was noticed for nutrient content in grain and straw and nutrient uptake. An increase in N level increased the plant height, dry matter, leaf-area index and nutrient uptake. The grain yield of rice was significantly highest when the crop was grown after sole blackgram.

To estimate GHGs from the land-use systems, we measured fluxes (positive/negative emissions per unit of time) of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4) from the cropping and adjacent non-cropping systems in Wakiso District, Uganda. The study comprised of 9 treatments with 2 inter-cropping systems (banana-coffee and maize-beans), 4 sole-cropped systems (banana, maize, beans, and sweet potato), and 3 non-cropping systems (fallow lands, pasture lands, and grasslands). Four management practices: mulching with no-tillage (mulched-NT); non-mulching with reduced-tillage (non-mulched-RT); non-mulching with deep-tillage (non-mulched-DT); compositing with reduced-tillage (compost-RT) were embedded in the cropping systems. The study also assessed the effect of the cropping systems and their management practices on crop yields. The GHG fluxes were monitored using the static chamber technique and analysed using a gas chromatography (G.C.). The results showed that all the land-use systems were sources of CO2 flux with sole-cropped sweet potato under non-mulched-DT (148.12 +/- 3.4 mu g C m(-2) h(-1)) as the most substantial source, and the grasslands (33.03 +/- 1.7 mu g C m(-2) h(-1)) as the weakest source. Similarly, all the land-use systems were sources of N2O flux with sole-cropped beans under non-mulched-RT (14.21 +/- 0.4 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) as the strongest source, and grasslands (3.43 +/- 0.4 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) as the weakest source. The management practices were sinks (any system that absorbs more GHGs than it releases) of CH4 except mulched-NT in the maize-beans intercrop, solecropped beans, and sole-cropped maize. The sole-cropped sweet potato under mulched-RT (0.3 +/- 0.01 mu g C m(-2) h(-1)) was the strongest source of CH4, while the grasslands (0.67 +/- 0.01 mu g C m(-2) h(-1)) were the strongest sink.

Insights from participatory agricultural research	PLOS ONE			English	Article							"FARM PRODUCTION DIVERSITY; DIETARY DIVERSITY; RISK ADJUSTMENT; SOIL FERTILITY; MARKET ACCESS; NUTRITION; FOOD; BIODIVERSITY; SECURITY; QUALITY"	We examine the association between on-farm production diversity on household dietary diversity in Malawi using microdata collected as part of an environmentally sustainable agricultural intensification program. The program primarily focuses on the integration of legumes into the cropping system through maize-legume intercropping and legume-legume intercropping. Relative to staple cereals such as maize, legumes are rich in micronutrients, contain better-quality protein, and lead to nitrogen fixation. Given the systematic difference we document between program beneficiaries and randomly sampled non-beneficiary (control) households, we employ causal instrumental variables mediation analysis to account for non-random selection and possible simultaneity between production and consumption decisions. We find a significant positive treatment effect on dietary diversity, led by an increase in production diversity. Analysis of potential pathways show that effects on dietary diversity stem mostly from consumption of diverse food items purchased from the market made possible through higher agricultural income. These findings highlight that, while increasing production for markets can enhance dietary diversity through higher income that would make affordable an expanded set of food items, the production of more nutritious crops such as pulses may not necessarily translate into greater own consumption. This may be due to the persistence of dietary habits, tastes, or other local factors that favor consumption of staples such as maize and encourage sales of more profitable and nutritious food items such as pulses. Pulses are a more affordable and environmentally sustainable source of protein than animal source food, and efforts should be made to enhance their nutritional awareness and contribution to sustainable food systems and healthier diets.

Combining plots diminished the residual variance of millet from 0.52 (t/ha)(2) of the original 1 m x 1 m units to 0.08 (t/ha)(2) for 4 m x 4 m plots, the largest for which reliable estimates could be derived. The residual variance of maize declined from 4.91 (t/ha)(2) of the original units to 0.61 (t/ha)(2) for 4 m x 4 m plots. Orientation was immaterial. The variogram for miller was isotropic and bounded with a range of approximately 4 m. Within-plot variance calculated from the variogram increased, and experimental error decreased, as the size of plots increased to this value, beyond which there was little gain. The variogram for maize was unbounded, and so gave no 'natural' upper limit for plot size, that is, over the range studied, up to 6 m x 6 m. It was also anisotropic with larger gradient in the direction 6 om front to back of the terrace than along the contour. The reduction in residual variance was greatest for narrow plots elongated in this direction. Formulae are provided from which to calculate from the variogram approximate residual variances for experiments of given area and size, shape, and orientation of plots. Its application gave similar results to those from the combined plot analysis. Overall, the results from the two methods were consistent.

This paper reports the results of experiments conducted over two crop seasons on the feasibility of producing a grain crop of cowpea intercropped with cotton to take advantage of cotton's slow initial growth and of drift from insecticides applied to it. Intercropping reduced the yield of cotton by between 11.5 and 73% depending on the type of season and the treatments applied, but the reduction was compensated by the yield of cowpea. The yield reduction was greater in the drier first season and with simultaneous planting of the two crops. Cowpea consistently performed better as an intercrop than as a sole crop, mainly because of the protection it received from the insecticides applied to the cotton.

Performance of Cassava under Lime, Fertilizer, and Legume Intercropping on Exhausted Land in Northern Zambia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article							"RADIATION-USE EFFICIENCY; GRAIN LEGUMES; YIELD; GROWTH; COWPEA; SOIL; INTERCEPTION; WATER; ACCUMULATION; PRODUCTIVITY"	Cassava yields of 6 t ha(-1) are lower than the potential yield of 20-25 t ha(-1) obtained in Northern Zambia. It is grown in legume intercropping with little or no fertilizer, causing nutrient depletion with consequent land abandonment. Therefore, the study objective was to investigate the performance of cassava under lime, fertilizer, and grain legume intercropping on exhausted land in Northern Zambia. A split-split plot design experiment was conducted over two seasons, comprising two lime rates (0 and 300 kg ha(-1)), two fertilizer rates (0 and 100N : 23P:80 K kg ha(-1)), and three grain legumes (common beans, cowpea, and soybean) intercropped in cassava and sole cassava arranged in RCBD with three replications. Periodic measurements of leaf area index (LAI), light interception, weather data, and yield components were recorded. A linear mixed model with year as a random factor was performed to assess the treatment effect of lime, fertilizer, and legume species intercropping on cassava growth characteristics, radiation-use efficiency (RUE), and selected yield components. Lime, fertilizer rates, and legume species intercropping were assigned as main, sub-, and sub-sub-treatments, respectively. Fertilization and fertilization + lime treatments in sole cassava and cassava-common bean intercropping significantly increased the RUE and light extinction coefficient (k) compared to nonfertilized and only lime treatments. Lime x fertilizer x cropping system interaction was significant on chlorophyll index and plant height, RUE, tuber yield, HI, and total dry matter (TDM) yield. Cropping system x year interactions were significant on season LAI. On average, every kg of cassava yield loss in intercropping was compensated by 0.46 kg soybean, 0.20 kg common beans, and 0.26 kg of cowpea. NPK fertilizer + lime, NPK fertilizer, and grain legume intercropping may be adopted to increase cassava tuber yields and legume grain yield response on nutrient-depleted soils in high rainfall areas of Zambia.

Developing a Soil Quality Indices for different crop rotations of Deltaic Inceptisol regions of India	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS			English	Article						"Soil quality indicators; soil quality indices; crop rotations; principal component analysis; scoring"		Soil quality index (SQI) is the tool for evaluating the sustainability of soil as affected by different factors such as land-use change and agricultural management practices. For a growing population, decreasing the land, maintaining soil quality is crucial to reach food security. Thus, the study aimed to select better crop rotation for the Inceptisol Deltaic region of Tamil Nadu using the SQI. Therefore, to develop SQI, samples were taken from the one-year-old already established field which comprising seven different crop rotations viz., Rice - Black gram, Rice- Sesame, Rice + Daincha - Maize + Green gram, Rice + Daincha - Bhendi, Rice + Daincha - Ragi, Rice + Daincha - Varagu, Rice + Daincha - Fodder Cowpea with first crop of green manure in all rotations. Nineteen physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil was analyzed. Minimum data set (MDS) were created based on principal component analysis (PCA) and Pearson's inter-correlation. The MDS consist of Soil organic carbon (SOC), Labile carbon (LC), Dehydrogenase activity (DHA), Oxidizable carbon fraction 2 (OX2), Oxidizable carbon fraction 3 (OX3), available potassium (K), and urease. Scoring was given to MDS and SQI was calculated. The percent contribution of MDS toward SQI was in the order of SOC = LC = FDA (24%) > Available K (11%) > OX2 (6%) > DHA = urease (4%) >OX3 (3%). The results revealed that crop rotations had a significant impact on soil quality by altering their properties. The maize-based legume intercropped crop rotations recorded a higher SQI value (1.18).

Merr.) biomass and protein	JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ACKER UND PFLANZENBAU			English	Article						"competition; corn yields; inoculant; silage; soybean yields"	"YIELD; CORN; PATTERNS; SILAGE; MAIZE"	Intercropping soybeans with corn can produce yields of silage comparable to monocrops of corn but with a higher protein concentration. To maximize N-2-fixation by soybeans, it is important to use a strain of bradyrhizobium that is well adapted to local soil and climate conditions. In 1991 and 1992 an experiment was conducted in Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada, to compare a locally isolated bradyrhizobium strain, NS1, with a commercial strain (COM). Corn-soybean intercrops and soybean monocrops were grown and various response variables were measured to assess the efficacy of each strain. NS1 proved to be superior to the commercial strain of bradyrhizobium in both intercrops and monocrops when soybean plant protein concentration, soybean seed protein concentration and soybean seed biomass yield were measured. For intercrop protein yield and intercrop protein concentration NS1 outperformed COM only in monocrops, Protein yields per hectare of soybeans grown in either system were higher when NS1 was used as an inoculant. No differences were observed between inoculants in biomass yields of soybeans grown in either system. Since soybeans only contributed 28.5% to the total biomass of intercrops, the biomass of the corn probably masked the differences between the two inoculants for intercrop protein yield and concentration. However, even under the stressful conditions for soybean plants associated with intercropping, soybean protein concentrations and yields when grown in intercrops were higher for the NS1 strain of bradyrhizobium. It appears that selection of a locally adapted strain of inoculant for soybeans can prove useful in both monocropping and intercropping systems.

Because such problems often occur in resource-poor farming systems, companion cropping to manage parasitic plants is an appropriate approach. Many examples of companion cropping for this purpose have been reported, but the use of cattle forage legumes in the genus Desmodium as intercrops has been shown to be particularly successful in controlling the parasitic witchweeds (Striga spp.) that afflict approximately one quarter of subSaharan African cereal production. Through the use of this example, the development of effective companion crops is described, together with developments toward widespread adoption and understanding the underlying mechanisms, both for sustainability and ensuring food security, and also for exploitation beyond the cropping systems described here.

There were three planting times: sorghum + soybean sown at the same time (S-1), sorghum sown 15 days before soybean (S-2), sorghum sown 15 days after soybean (S-3) and four spatial arrangements (sorghum and soybean sown in 1: 1(T-1), 1: 2(T-2), 2: 1(T-3) and 2: 2 (T-4) row proportions). The experiment was carried out in randomized complete block design (RCBD) with factorial arrangements and was replicated thrice. The statistical analysis of data revealed that forage sorghum sown 15 days before soybean in 2: 1 row proportion (S2T3) recorded the highest physiological growth. The same treatment was instrumental in giving the highest quality forage with considerably higher crude protein, ether extractable fat and ash contents; however soybean performed better when it was sown 15 days before forage sorghum in 2: 2 row proportions (S3T4). Data regarding economic analysis for different intercropping systems revealed that the highest net income of Rs. 42971 and Rs. 46871 ha(-1) and BCR of 2.13 and 2.24 were earned from sorghum sown 15 days before soybean in 2: 1 row proportion (S2T3) during 2013 and 2014 respectively.

The seasonal variation in plant-mediated CH4 emissions during open-water periods was significantly correlated with sediment temperature. The highest plant-mediated emission rates (up to 2050 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) were found in the outermost reed zone, where culms of the previous growing seasons had accumulated and free-floating plants grew on the decomposing culms. In reed zones closer to the shoreline as well as in mixed stands of reed and cattail, the maximum daily rates were usually >500 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1). The total plant-mediated CH4 emission during the open-water period was significantly correlated with the seasonal maximum of green shoot biomass. This relationship was strongest in the continuously flooded (water depth >25 cm) outermost zones. In this area, emissions through ebullition were of greatest importance and could exceed plant-mediated emissions. In general, total emissions of the open-water periods varied from ca. 20 to 50 g CH4 m(-2) a(-1), but in the outermost reed zone, the plant-mediated emissions could be as high as 123 g CH4 m(-2) a(-1); ebullition emissions from this zone reached >100 g CH4 m(-2) a(-1). The proportion of CH4 released in winter was usually <10% of annual emissions. Emissions of CH4 were higher in this flooded transgression shore the than those measured in boreal peatlands, but the role of ancient carbon stores as a substrate supply compared with recent anthropogenic eutrophication is unknown."

The objective of the present study was to study the effect of water availability of wheat-pea intercrops using agronomic and physiological characteristics. The experiment was conducted at the farm of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece during two growing seasons 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 using two different cultivars from pea (Isard and Olympos) and wheat (Yecora E and Elissavet) and two irrigation regimes. The availability of water increased grain yield and affected most of the characteristics that were studied. In terms of total Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) there was a yield advantage of intercrops over monocrops, which indicates the efficiency of intercropping for using the environmental resources. Both wheat cultivars, the pea cultivar Olympos and their intercrops indicated high adaptation capacity to rainfed conditions, whereas Isard and its intercrops performed better under irrigation. Therefore, the intercropping of wheat with pea uses the water resources of the environment more efficiently and can be used in dry land conditions for higher yield.

With the proposition of using intercropping to overcome these problems, this study explored the effects of combinations of different associated crop species and spatial arrangements on grain production and weed control. In a two-year field experiment in western France, soybean was intercropped with buckwheat, lentil, sorghum and sunflower in two spatial arrangements: within-row intercropping and alternate-row intercropping, to investigate their effects on weed control and soybean production. The results showed that the highest soybean yield occurred in the intercropping with lentil, followed by sorghum and sunflower, and finally buckwheat, but this effect varied by year. The opposite species order was obtained for weed control, revealing a trade-off between soybean production and weed control. We also demonstrated that associated species height was related to soybean yield and weed control. Alternate-row intercropping helped to increase soybean production without compromising weed control for sorghum and buckwheat, which have small height difference with soybean. Finally, our paper showed that combining associated species choice and spatial arrangement allows farmers to manage the trade-off between soybean yield and weed control.

A 2-year field study was conducted using common vetch (Vicia sativa), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum), triticale (x Triticosecale),barley (Hordeum vulgare) and oat (Avena sativa) sole crops as well as common vetch intercrops with each of these cereals in a 35:65 cereal:common vetch ratio based on seed numbers, to determine their ability to compete with sterile oat (Avena sterilis spp. sterilis). At nine weeks after planting, fewer sterile oat plants emerged in common vetch sole crop than in cereal sole crops. Intercropping of cereals with common vetch generally did not affect sterile oat stern number and biomass compared with cereal sole crops. At harvest, cereal sole crops provided greater total dry biomass (DB) titan the common vetch sole crop. However, triticale and oat produced more DB than winter wheat and barley: In most cases intercropping reduced total DB compared with cereal sole crops. The results of this study indicated that intercropping of the four winter cereals with common vetch did not provide any significant. competitive advantage against sterile oat.. However, common vetch sole crop showed the greatest. suppressive ability against sterile oat among the sole crops or intercrops studied.

Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) has produced equal or greater amounts of superior quality forage in subhumid regions. The importance of cereal crop, cultivar, and plant part on forage production was determined in low-soil-N environments in southwestern North Dakota. Barley and oat cultivars, along with intercrops of pea (Pisum sativum L. subsp. sativum) with barley and oat, were compared for forage yield and quality over 2 yr. Forage dry matter (DM) yield averaged 3.84 Mg ha(-1) for oat compared with 2.91 Mg ha(-1) for barley while crude protein (CP) concentration of oat forage averaged 61 g kg(-1) compared with 90 g kg(-1) for barley (P < 0.05). No difference in forage N yield occurred between barley and oat. Acid detergent fiber and neutral detergent fiber concentrations averaged 39 and 41 g kg(-1) lower, respectively, for barley compared with oat forage while Ca and P concentrations were higher for barley forage. Cultivar selection within each crop species generally did not affect forage yield or quality. The relative contributions of stem, inflorescence, leaf blade, and leaf sheath to forage yield were similar between cereal species and averaged 20, 44, 14, and 22%, respectively. Intercropping with pea increased forage and N yield. These results suggest that forage yield is reduced but quality is enhanced when oat is replaced with barley in low-soil-N, unfertilized environments. Furthermore, the results indicate that forage yield and quality can be enhanced by intercropping barley or oat with pea.

An experiment was conducted to examine the effect of tomato intercrop on various traits of baby corn, and to determine the appropriate combination from the different varieties of the two crops for maximizing performance and profitability. A replicated field study was conducted using four baby corn and two tomato cultivars at Rampur, Nepal in 2007. There were two open-pollinated ('Arun-2' and 'Rampur Composite') and two hybrid ('Bioseed 9681' and 'JK Puja') corn varieties. The tomato cultivars were 'BSS-418' and 'Umi' hybrids. The different combinations of corn and tomato varied in total crop productivity from the intercropping system. The combination of BSS 418 tomato with Arun-2 and Bioseed 9681 corn cultivars produced equal but higher total yield than the other mixtures. The average benefit cost ratio for intercrops vs. sole crops was 1.9:1. Individually, the benefit cost ratios were 3.0:1 and 1.4:1 for the sole tomato and corn, respectively. The land equivalent ratio was 1.78 for baby corn-tomato intercropping. The findings provide new information on the understanding of baby corn and tomato intercropping and its additional profitability over the sole crops.	"[Sharma, M. D.; Shakya, S.

The different treatments were: CS-1 was fallow-wheat based, CS-2 was maize (grain) based, CS-3, CS-7 and CS-9 were groundnut based, CS-4 was canola based, CS-5 was oats fodder based. CS-6 and CS-8 were sunflower+mungbean (intercropped) based and CS-10 was maize fodder based sequences. The water use efficiency of wheat was enhanced in fallow-wheat sequence by 8.77, 4.96 and 19.56% compared to groundnut-wheat sequence in high, medium and low rainfall locations, respectively. The water use efficiency of sunflower and mungbean decreased in wheat-(sunflower+mungbean intercropped) sequence by 271.97 and 37.47% in comparison to fallow-(sunflower+mungbean intercropped) sequence in high and medium rainfall zones, respectively. Thus water use efficiency of sunflower and mungbean in spring season was 124.85 and 144.54% higher as compared to those in summer season that might be due to favourable temperature and effective rainfall that enhanced partitioning of dry matter towards the grain filling of both the crops. The rainfall in excess of the crop water requirement lowered the water use efficiency at all locations. The economic analysis of the data revealed the highest net benefit of Rs. 34738 and monetary benefit of Rs. 39 per mm of rainfall were harvested as compared to the rest of the cropping sequences in high rainfall zone of Pothwar. Under the medium and low rainfall condition monetary benefit per unit rainfall were substantially higher in the groundnut based cropping sequences (Rs. 21-32 Rs. ha(-1) mm(-1)), followed by canola based ones. On the basis of consecutive three years experimentation, it is strongly recommended that the summer fallowing should be replaced with sunflower+mungbean (intercropped) in high rainfall zone and with groundnut in both medium and low rainfall zones of Pothwar Plateau in order to harvest rainfall water efficiently and accruing higher economic returns.

Squarrosa) is reported new to arctic North America and eastern Russia. This species was recently described from Svalbard, arctic Norway, and has until now not been reported from other areas. It is argued, that it reached Svalbard in early/middle Holocene by long distance chance dispersal through icerafting diaspores following main Arctic Ocean currents from arctic Eurasian sources. Supposedly closely related to S. teres, the distinctness of the gene pools of those two species is evaluated through isozyme analysis of a mixed population, as well as small samples from three other S. tundrae sites and two sites with S. teres populations from Svalbard. Fifteen putative enzyme loci were screened. Very little intraspecific genetic diversity was detected. Sphagnum tundrae was monomorphic throughout the four populations studied, whereas S. teres had three hoplotypes. The mean genetic identify (Nei 1978) among populations of S. tundrae and S. teres in this sample from Svalbard was calculated as 0.525, which is in concordance with values obtained among other Sphagnum species. Sphagnum mirum is described as a new species from subarctic Alaska, differing in essential morphological characteristics from the related S. teres and S. tundrae. Morphological variation in mixed stands of S. mirum and S. teres from the type locality clearly demonstrates its specific distinctness in qualitative as well as quantitative characteristics.

Spring peas (cv. Magnus) and wheat (cv. Axona) sown at either high (75:25) or low (25:75) pea inclusion rates were harvested after 13 (Cut 1) or 15 (Cut 2) wk. Eighteen Holstein-Friesian cows between wk 9 and 10 of lactation were used in a cyclical changeover design with three 28-d periods. Cows were fed the bi-crop silages and 6 kg of concentrates or second-cut grass silage supplemented with 6 (GS6) or 9 (GS9) kg/d of concentrates. Forage intakes were higher when bi-crops were fed (10.3 to 11.4 kg dry matter [DM]/d) than when grass silage was fed (8.6 kg DM/d). Total DM intake was similar among cows fed the bi-crop silages and GS9 diets, but intakes for GS6 were at least 1.7 kg DM/d lower. Increasing the pea inclusion rate increased the crude protein (CP) content of the ration, but it did not enhance forage quality or animal performance. The rate of intake of the different forages was similar, so that the higher intakes of bi-crop silages were associated with more time spent at the feedbunk and an increased number of meals. Diet digestibility ranged from 531 to 650 g/kg, and the highest value was given by the Cut 1 bi-crop silage diet. Milk yield tended to be similar for cows fed the Cut 2 bi-crop and GS9 diets, and these values were at least 1.7 kg higher than those for cows fed on other treatments. Generally, the bi-crop diets resulted in higher milk fat contents and lower polyunsaturated fatty acid contents. Milk protein content was highest for cows fed the GS9 diet. Blood metabolite content was unaffected by treatment except for blood urea nitrogen content, which was higher in cows fed the bi-crop silages, reflecting reduced N-use efficiency with these diets. The study showed that pea-wheat bi-crop silages can be used to replace moderate-quality grass silage in dairy cow rations, but their role as alternatives to high-quality forages requires additional investigation.

Disentangling the impact of contrasting agricultural management practices on soil microbial communities-Importance of rare bacterial community members	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						"Agricultural management; Crop rotation; Crop residue restitution; Microbial communities; Soil DNA; 16S rRNA genes"	"ORGANIC-MATTER; NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; CROP-ROTATION; AGGREGATE; DIVERSITY; RHIZOSPHERE; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; TILLAGE"	Agriculture has a strong effect on soil microbial communities, but it is still unclear how different management practices drive their diversity and composition. To disentangle the effects of temporally contrasting crop man-agement practices on soil microbial abundance and prokaryotic diversity, we analysed samples from a long-term agricultural field experiment, in which plant residues were exported (RE) or returned to soil, i.e., restituted (RR), over a period of 60 years. For 2.5 years, we followed a cropping sequence of maize, winter wheat and barley, in which, as an additional treatment, wheat cultivation was diversified once with pea intercropping. Based on soil-extracted DNA, abundances of bacteria, archaea and fungi were analysed by domain-specific qPCR and the di-versity and composition of the prokaryotic community by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The abundance of bacteria and fungi, but not for archaea, increased with the long-term restitution, but this effect was only detectable in spring due to their stabilized abundance during winter. The long-term effect of crop restitution on bacterial diversity became tangible when rare and dominant community members were differentiated, with higher sensitivity shown for the rare. In contrast, the cropping sequence equally affected members of both groups. The short-term effect of crop diversification by intercropping was much stronger in the C-depleted RE soils, than in RR soils where the C-loss was compensated, indicating that crop residue restitution increased the environmental resilience of soil microbial communities. Finally, we could confirm that rare bacterial community members, suspected to represent more oligotrophs and synergistic bacteria, formed stronger network structures to each other than the dominant, suspected to be more copiotrophic and competitive. Therefore, our results emphasize the importance to consider the response of rare microbial community members when evaluating long-term effects of agricultural management on the soil microbiome.

Land productivity and water use efficiency are the important factors that affect the application of this planting, pattern. In this research, two peanut-millet intercropping patterns were studied in comparison with sole planting pattern of peanut or foxtail millet to reduce water consumption and improve water use efficiency. One intercropping system was 2P2M (2-row peanut with 2-row millet), and the other was 4P2M (4-row peanut with 2-row millet). Some indices were calculated to characterize the intercropping efficiency of land and water use as compared to those of sole crops of peanut and foxtail millet. The results showed that land equivalent ratio (LER) of two peanut-millet intercropping patterns ranged from 1.15 to 1.19, while water equivalent ratio (WER) ranged from 1.17 to 1.22, and Delta WU, the relative departure of actual water use in intercropping from expected use, was close to zero, indicated that peanut-millet intercropping increased the productivity but didn't increase the water consumption. The foxtail millet in the intercropping population gained more water compared with peanut; the soil water of foxtail millet strips in the 2P2M and 4P2M increased 69% and 45%, respectively, as compared with that of peanut strips after a 58.8mm rainfall during the midterm of crops growth. These findings suggest that the rainfall's distribution in the soil of different crops was optimized in the peanut-millet intercropping system."

Shorter legume crops in intercropping are shaded by taller cereals, substantially reducing legume growth and yield. Reducing shade in intercropping by shortening the plant height of cereals by seedling defoliation has been proposed as a practical approach to increase crop yields and land productivity. A two-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of defoliation of cereal crops at seedling stage on the growth and yield of peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) intercropped with corn (Zea mays L.) or millet (Setaria italica L.). In comparison with non-defoliation controls, defoliation reduced final plant height by 29 cm on average for corn and 18 cm for millet. Photosynthetically active radiation on peanut in intercropping systems with corn or millet intercropping was respectively 27.0% and 22.8% higher than those in controls, significantly improving the light environment of intercropped peanut. Net photosynthetic rates of peanut were on average 25.5% higher in corn and peanut intercropping and 19.6% higher in millet and peanut intercropping than those in non-defoliation controls. Total biomass of intercropped peanut increased owing to increased root growth. Across two years, yield of peanut intercropped with corn was 27.7% and with millet 32.8% higher than those of controls. Defoliation of cereal crops did not affect corn yield but significantly decreased millet yield by 24.5%. Our results suggest that applying seedling defoliation in intercropped corn could increase peanut yield without compromising corn yield in an intercropping system.

Crop dry matter yields, nitrogen and carbon contents (including grain, straw and root) were measured. Compared with sole corn, corn dry matter yield and carbon accumulation decreased in intercropped soybean. Intercropping decreased the corn C:N ratio, whereas it increased soybean C:N ratio. Nitrogen application significantly increased corn yield, nitrogen and carbon accumulation, but reduced those of soybean. Nitrogen application decreased corn straw C:N ratio and increased soybean straw C:N ratio in most intercropping systems. In conclusion, intercropping and nitrogen rates affected the growth of corn and soybean, changed the allocations of nitrogen and carbon, and altered C:N ratios in different parts of the crops.

Most studies focus on airborne pathogens in bread wheat, while splash-dispersed pathogens have received less attention, and no studies have been conducted in durum wheat. We conducted a 2-year field experiment in Tunisia to evaluate the performance of cultivar mixtures with varying proportions of resistance (0%-100%) in controlling the polycyclic, splash-dispersed disease septoria tritici blotch (STB) in durum wheat. To measure STB severity, we used a high-throughput method based on digital image analysis of 3,074 infected leaves collected from 42 and 40 experimental plots during the first and second years, respectively. This allowed us to quantify pathogen reproduction on wheat leaves and to acquire a large data set that exceeds previous studies with respect to accuracy and precision. Our analyses show that introducing only 25% of a disease-resistant cultivar into a pure stand of a susceptible cultivar provides a substantial reduction of almost 50% in disease severity compared to the susceptible pure stand. However, incorporating two resistant cultivars instead of one did not further improve disease control, contrary to predictions of epidemiological theory. Susceptible cultivars can be agronomically superior to resistant cultivars or be better accepted by growers for other reasons. Hence, if mixtures with only a moderate proportion of the resistant cultivar provide a similar degree of disease control as resistant pure stands, as our analysis indicates, such mixtures are more likely to be accepted by growers.

The experiment was laid out in split-plot-design with four replications comprising two CEMs [transplanted-cotton (TPC) and direct-seeded-cotton (DSC)] and three planting geometries/plant densities [(90x60 cm (18,518 plants/ha); 75 x 45 cm (29629 plants/ha) and 60x45 cm (37,037 plants/ha)] and four cropping systems viz. TPC-wheat-mungbean; TPC-onion-fodder cowpea + maize; DSC-wheat; and DSC-onion cropping system under above two CEMs. Among CEMs, the DSC-cotton resulted in higher plant growth though the seed yield and lint yield were respectively higher by similar to 9.54% and similar to 15% under TPC-cotton over DSC-cotton due to better plant stand in TPC-CEM. On an average, the significantly highest system productivity in terms of seed-cottonequivalent-yield (SCEY) was registered in TPC-wheat-mungbean/TPC-onion-fodder cowpea + maize cropping systems (mean of both systems) during 2014-15 (6.75 t/ha) and 2015-16 (6.96 t/ha), respectively. In general, the legume-intensification in TPC-based cropping systems exhibited about 25 to 27% higher system yield (SCEY) over DSC-based cropping systems. The TPC-based cropping systems exhibited additional net economic gains of (sic)43000/ha vis-a-vis higher weed suppression, system crop and water productivity, system economic-efficiency and land-use efficiency over the DSC-based systems.

After clearing different subplots of the fallowed plots in 1993 and 1995, intercropping of cassava + maize was practiced with level (minimum) and mound tillage. Nitrogen fertilizer, between 0 and 60 kg ha(-1), was also applied to subplots of natural regrowth where planted fallows did not survive. Although a maize grain yield of 2.3 t ha(-1) and a cassava root yield of 18.3 t ha(-1) were obtained with level tillage in 1995, grain yield was increased to 2.6 t ha- I and cassava yields to about 22 t ha(-1) by mounding and 60 kg N ha(-1) application. Effects of mounding and N application were pronounced in the second and third consecutive years of cropping. Planted tree fallows like S. siamea, A. leptocarpa and L. leucocephala were highly suitable for soil rehabilitation. For sustainable crop production in the second consecutive year of cropping after a 6-year fallow period, mound tillage was recommended while in the third year, mound tillage with 60 kg N ha(-1) was recommended.

J	"McKee, KL; Vervaeke, WC"				"McKee, Karen L.; Vervaeke, William C."			Will fluctuations in salt marsh-mangrove dominance alter vulnerability of a subtropical wetland to sea-level rise?	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						"accretion; Avicennia germinans; climate change; coastal wetland; disturbance; elevation; sedimentation; Spartina alterniflora"	"GULF-OF-MEXICO; MISSISSIPPI RIVER DELTA; AVICENNIA-GERMINANS; SURFACE ELEVATION; COASTAL WETLANDS; BLACK MANGROVE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PEAT COLLAPSE; RANGE LIMIT; EXPANSION"	To avoid submergence during sea-level rise, coastal wetlands build soil surfaces vertically through accumulation of inorganic sediment and organic matter. At climatic boundaries where mangroves are expanding and replacing salt marsh, wetland capacity to respond to sea-level rise may change. To compare how well mangroves and salt marshes accommodate sea-level rise, we conducted a manipulative field experiment in a subtropical plant community in the subsiding Mississippi River Delta. Experimental plots were established in spatially equivalent positions along creek banks in monospecific stands of Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) or Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) and in mixed stands containing both species. To examine the effect of disturbance on elevation dynamics, vegetation in half of the plots was subjected to freezing (mangrove) or wrack burial (salt marsh), which caused shoot mortality. Vertical soil development was monitored for 6 years with the surface elevation table-marker horizon system. Comparison of land movement with relative sea-level rise showed that this plant community was experiencing an elevation deficit (i.e., sea level was rising faster than the wetland was building vertically) and was relying on elevation capital (i.e., relative position in the tidal frame) to survive. Although Avicennia plots had more elevation capital, suggesting longer survival, than Spartina or mixed plots, vegetation type had no effect on rates of accretion, vertical movement in root and sub-root zones, or net elevation change. Thus, these salt marsh and mangrove assemblages were accreting sediment and building vertically at equivalent rates. Small-scale disturbance of the plant canopy also had no effect on elevation trajectoriescontrary to work in peat-forming wetlands showing elevation responses to changes in plant productivity. The findings indicate that in this deltaic setting with strong physical influences controlling elevation (sediment accretion, subsidence), mangrove replacement of salt marsh, with or without disturbance, will not necessarily alter vulnerability to sea-level rise.

J	"Cheng, ZB; Chen, Y; Zhang, FH"				"Cheng, Zhibo; Chen, Yun; Zhang, Fenghua"			Effect of cropping systems after abandoned salinized farmland reclamation on soil bacterial communities in arid northwest China	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH			English	Article						"Cropping systems; Abandoned salinized farmland; Bacterial community; Metabolic functions; High-throughput sequencing"	"MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; SALT TOLERANCE; AGGREGATE STABILITY; DIVERSITY; TILLAGE; MAIZE; WHEAT; RHIZOSPHERE; MANAGEMENT; FRACTIONS"	Cropping systems are extensively used in northwest China, which alter the soil structure and nutrients, causing the changes in the soil bacterial community. Although soil bacterial communities respond differently to altered cropping systems, little is known about possible effect of cropping systems on soil bacterial communities in reclaimed soils. Using pyrosequencing-based analysis of the 16S rRNA gene, we investigated the effect of 5-year cropping systems on bacterial communities in reclaimed soils in northwest China for the first time. The three cropping systems are: maize-wheat rotation (MW), tree intercrop with cotton (TC), and monoculture cotton (MC). We have observed soil properties are obviously changed by cropping systems. The lowest soil electrical conductivity (EC), the highest aggregate stability indices (MWD and GMD) and soil organic matter (SOM) content are found in MW (P < 0.05). The dominant phyla are Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Chloroftexi and Actinobacteria and these are present across all samples from all treatments. The highest bacterial diversity is observed in MW. The relative abundance of dominant phyla are significantly correlated EC, SOM, Fe, MWD and GMD (P < 0.05), suggesting that EC, SOM, Fe, MWD and GMD are the most important factors in shaping soil bacterial communities. Functional predictions indicate that the abundance of amino acid metabolism, carbon metabolism, glycan biosynthesis, methane metabolism, two-component and fatty acid metabolism are all enriched in MW. Overall, our study reveal that different cropping systems have different impacts not only on bacterial composition and diversity, but also on the main metabolic functions. These findings guide our future work on soil bacterial metabolic functions in different cropping systems and will provide references for salinized farmland reclamation in arid areas.

The mean value of NO3--N concentrations in groundwater samples was 10.66 +/- 0.19 mg l(-1). NO3--N concentrations exceeding 10 mg l(-1) (the threshold for drinking water set by the World Health Organization) were found in 32.4% of 71 wells, and were 13, 33.3, 52.4 and 50.0% in the groundwater samples from drinking wells, irrigation wells, hand-pumping wells and groundwater table observation wells, respectively. The result showed that the groundwater samples that had NO3--N concentrations exceeding the threshold for drinking water were mostly collected from a depth of less than 20 m. Groundwater NO3--N concentrations in areas used for the cultivation of vegetables, seed maize and intercropped maize were significantly higher than those in urban or paddy areas. NO3--N contamination of groundwater in areas with sandy soil was more severe than in those with loam soil.

Previous studies have found that these effects are more tangible under low soil and fertilizer N conditions compared to high N availability, and there is a need to assess the N uptake at critical crop development stages in order to time the N application for maximum uptake and use efficiency. The objective of this study was to assess the productivity of pea-barley intercropping compared to monocropping under 0 kg N ha(-1) (0 N) and 100 kg N ha(-1) (100 N). In 2017, a split plot experimental design was implemented with pea (Pisum sativum) sole crop (SC pea), barley (Hordeum vulgare) sole crop (SC barley), and pea-barley intercrop (IC total) as the main plots and 100 N applications in two 50 kg N ha(-1) splits at 30 and 60 days after emergence as subplots within the main plots. The Land Equivalent Ratio (LER), based on grain dry matter (GDM) yields in the pea-barley intercrop (IC total), was higher (1.14 at 0 N and 1.10 at 100 N), indicating 10-14% greater radiation, nutrient, and water use efficiency compared to the sole crops and 4% greater resource use efficiency at 0 N compared to the 100 N; this illustrated greater total intercrop productivity compared to sole crops. The 100 N treatment decreased the SC pea and pea in intercrop (IC pea) GDM and grain dry matter N (GDMN) and increased the GDM and GDMN in SC barley and barley in the intercrop (IC barley). Intercropping increased the grain N content and therefore the protein content of the grains in 0 N and 100 N treatments. The highest fertilizer N yield, % nitrogen derived from fertilizer (%NDFF), and % nitrogen use efficiency (%NUE) were achieved in SC barley followed by IC total, indicating that intercropping improved the soil and fertilizer N use compared to SC pea. The IC pea increased the % nitrogen derived from atmosphere (%NDFA) from 67.9% in SC pea to 70.1% in IC pea. IC total increased the share of %NDFF, %NDFS, and %NDFA compared to the SC pea, which indicated a significant advantage of intercropping due to the complementarity of the component species under limited N supply in the field."

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of Zn and AAs foliar application on physiological parameters, nutritional status, yield components and grain yield of wheat-soybean intercropping under a no-till management. We used a randomized block experimental design consisting of eight treatments and four replicates. The treatments were five Zn rates (0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 kg ha(-1)) and 2 L ha(-1) of AAs and three additional treatments: a control (without the Zn or AA application), 2 kg ha(-1) Zn and 2 kg ha(-1) Zn + 1 L AA. The treatments were applied by spraying during the final elongation stage and at the beginning of pre-earing for the wheat and in growth stage V6 for the soybean for two crop years in a Typic Oxisol (860 g kg(-1) clay). Zinc foliar fertilization increased the wheat grain Zn concentrations. The Zn rates and AA foliar fertilization in soil with did not affect the physiological parameters, nutrient status or yield components. The AA application at the different concentrations tested changed the soybean grain yield and the leaf N concentration. The results suggest that Zn and amino acids application increases the grains Zn concentration in the wheat, being an important strategy to agronomic biofortification.	"[Souza, J.

Assessment of Double-Crop and Relay-Intercropping Systems of Peanut with Soft Red Winter Wheat and Residual Herbicides	CROP FORAGE & TURFGRASS MANAGEMENT			English	Article							"TOMATO SPOTTED WILT; PLANTING DATE; YIELD; CULTIVAR; COTTON"	Multiple-cropping systems for peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) have potential in the southeastern United States where a prolonged growing season exists. Full-season soft red winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production typically pushes peanut planting later than optimum, but a relay-intercrop (RI) system may allow peanut to be planted on-time while still harvesting wheat grain. However, practical approaches for weed control in this system must be identified. Project objectives were to determine the most effective cropping systems to maximize wheat and peanut potential and assess efficacy and injury to wheat and peanut following different herbicide programs. Twelve cropping systems included variations of double-crop (DC), RI, and monocrop (MC) management. Studies were conducted at Tifton and Plains, GA, in 2011 and 2012. The RI treatments averaged 20 to 42% less wheat yield than DC systems. Similarly, peanut yield averaged 20 to 26% less, total sound mature kernels (TSMK) (2-7%) were reduced, and more tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) (Tospovirus) incidence (4-5%) occurred with earlier planting (RI and traditional MC scenarios) compared with later planting (DC and late MC). There were no differences in wheat yield when sprayed with imazapic compared with nonsprayed, indicating imazapic is not an injury concern in imidazolinone-resistant wheat.

Effect of Nitrogen, Row Spacing, and Plant Density on Yield, Yield Components, and Plant Physiology in Soybean-Wheat Intercropping	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							"FERTILIZATION; GROWTH; POTASSIUM; FIXATION"	The introduction of cultivars with earlier development and greater productivity has raised questions about the effect of management practices on soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr] yield in a no-till (NT) system. The objective of the study was to evaluate the interaction between N fertilization, row spacing, and plant density on photosynthetic index, yield components, yield, and nutritional status of soybean-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) intercropping. For soybean cultivation, three N rates, three row spacing, and three planting densities were assessed during two growing seasons, while for wheat, 17.5-cm row spacing and no N fertilization were used. No significant effects of row spacing and plant density were detected. The yields for 0 and 40 kg N ha(-1) rates were similar, while applying 20 kg N ha(-1) reduced, on average, soybean yield by 14.5%. The planting densities, row spacing, and N rates did not affect wheat yield, or oil and protein content in soybean seeds. Soil temperature (ST), intercellular carbon dioxide concentration (Ci), and intrinsic water use efficiency (IWUE) increased, while plant height, chlorophyll content (CC), and transpiration rate (Trmmol) decreased with increasing spacing of soybean. Plant density changed ST, Ci, chlorophyll content, and stomatal conductance (gs). Leaf tissue analysis indicated adequate nutrient levels in soybean and wheat. The current management practice with 50-cm row spacing, no N fertilization to complement biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), and 333,000 plants ha(-1) is adequate for soybean cultivation, while N supplied from soil organic matter (SOM) and BNF is sufficient to meet requirements of associated wheat crops.

The forages were harvested when the wheat and peas were at the late milk and yellow wrinkled stages respectively, and conserved in five replicate mini silos without treatment (control) or after treatment with 2.5 g kg(-1) of formic acid (FA) or 1 x 10(6) cfu g(-1) fresh forage of either of two bacterial inoculants (WholeCrop Gold (WCG) or WholeCrop Legume (WCL), Biotal Ltd, Cardiff, UK). WCG contained Lactobacillus buchneri, while WCL contained L buchneri, L plantarum and Pediococcus pentosaceus. Chemical composition, fermentation characteristics and in vitro digestibility were measured after 65 days of ensiling. Additive-treated bi-crops had lower (P < 0.05) concentrations of soluble N, ammonia N and lactic acid than the controls. Inoculant-treated bi-crops had higher (P < 0.001) acetic acid and lower (P < 0.001) residual water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) concentrations than FA-treated bi-crops. WCL-treated bi-crops had similar residual WSC concentrations to and higher (P < 0.05) starch concentrations than WCG-treated bi-crops. Unlike Magnus pea bi-crops, Setchey pea bi-crops treated with WCL had lower concentrations of ammonia N (P < 0.01) and acetic acid (P < 0.001) and higher concentrations of starch (P < 0.001) and lactic acid (P < 0.05) than those treated with WCG. For both bi-crops, FA-treated bi-crops were more stable (P < 0.05) than inoculant-treated or untreated silages, and the stability of inoculant-treated and untreated silages was similar. Formic acid treatment was also the most effective at reducing WSC losses in the bi-crop and pea silages. Inoculant treatment reduced proteolysis in these forages but did not prevent spoilage in the bi-crops. Additive treatment reduced yeast counts but did not improve the fermentation in wheat silages.

The experiment was carried out for six years in a randomized block design, in a 3x2 factorial arrangement with three soil management systems - no-tillage (SPD), minimum tillage (PPR), and conventional system (SPC) -, and two cover crops, one of maize and the other of maize intercropped with Stizolobium niveum (MM), with four replicates. COT levels, estimated for 0.00-0.30-m, soil depth were higher in SPD and PPR. Regardless of the evaluated soil depth, MM intercropped system promoted higher contents of particulate organic carbon (COP), which were strongly affected by straw incorporation. In all soil depths, negative correlations were observed between the contents of COP and those of carbon associated to minerals (COAM), which indicate the occurrence of priming effect. COT contents were positively correlated to those of COAM, stressing the importance of soil organic matter stabilization mechanisms for improving COT contents in the soil.

In MC, beans were planted 0.5 m apart. Trelisses were set up with 1.8 m high bamboos and beans were sown 0.65 m apart. In ICM, beans were planted simultaneously with maize and in its rows. This cereal was sown 1.0 m apart with four plants per meter. Each cropping system was an independent trial installed close to each other. Climbing genotypes of beans most susceptible to ALS had less diseased pods in ICM than in both MC and MCT, but the less susceptible genotypes, regardless of their growth type, as well as the susceptible bush and semiclimbing genotypes, were similarly attacked by ALS in the three systems. ANT on pods of the susceptible bean cv. Perola was less intense in MCT than in MC, and less intense in ICM than in MCT.

Sorghum production in North Gondar is challenged by the parasitic weed causing low crop yields. One of the options widely practiced is intercropping with legumes and variation in sowing dates of the intercropped crop species. A field experiment was conducted at two locations; Metema and Sanja at Gondar Agricultural Research Centers in the 2017/18 cropping season. Three sowing dates of soybean (2 weeks and 1 week before sowing and at a sorghum plantation) to control Striga. The study laid in a randomized complete block design with three replications in a factorial combination, two sorghum varieties; improved (Berhan) and a local variety commonly grown in the area and soybean Afgat varieties were used. A highly significant difference between Striga count (SC) and dry matter, grain yield (GY), above-ground biomass, and thousand seed weight (TSW) were the main effects and their interactions. SC, GY, and TSW were significant at Metema and combined over locations, but only GY at Sanja. Highest grain yield, biomass, thousand seed weight and lowest Striga counts was obtained in resistant variety at 2 weeks soybean sown before sorghum and, highest Striga was recorded in susceptible variety where soybean was sown at the same date with sorghum. Economic analysis results showed the highest and lowest net returns of 32,048.50 and 8,660 ETB per hectare from 2 weeks before with resistant sorghum and the same date with susceptible sorghum, respectively. Therefore, in the study area, the Berhan variety at 2 weeks before sorghum sowing is recommended for profitable sorghum production and Striga management."

In this study, the yield and quality characteristics of single and mixed cultivations of three oat (Avena sativa L.) varieties and Hungarian vetch (Vicia pannoica Crantz) were determined. Yield characteristics such as green forage and dry matter, crude protein and digestible dry matter yields and quality characteristics such as crude protein ratio, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, digestible dry matter, total digestible nutrient, dry matter intake and relative feed value were examined in the single and mixed cultivations. The result of the two-year research indicated that the highest green forage, dry matter, crude protein and digestible dry matter yields were obtained from the mixture of 25% HV + 75% O mixture of Saia oat variety (18.3, 5.7, 0.76, 3.6 t ha(-1), respectively). The highest crude protein, total digestible nutrients, relative feed value and the lowest ADF, NDF ratio were obtained from the single cultivation of Hungarian vetch (18.1%, 65.6%, 163.1 and 27.7%, 38.4%, respectively). In conclusion, with respect to the investigated quality parameters with forage yield, 50% HV + 50% O mixtures can be suggested.

Increasing N resulted in 9.9 and 17.6% silage yield increase at N-37 and N-74 levels compared with N-0. Nitrogen also increased organic acids and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) content. Silage pH was lower (4.23) where no fertilizer was applied compared with the fertilized plants (4.33). The highest crude protein (CP) content (170 g kg(-1) dry matter [DM]) and dry mass (248 g DM kg(-1) fresh weight) was at the N74. Silage produced by the millet-soybean mixtures was well fermented indicated by low pH and high lactic acid. Also, intercropping ratios had less acid detergent fiber (ADF) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) than monocultures. Although all of the intercropping ratios had characteristics of well-fermented silage, a mixture of 60% millet and 40% soybean could be superior because of higher silage yield and CP."

The greater plant diversity in T2-T6 and T8 resulted in higher geometric mean diameter (GMD) of aggregates compared to T1 and T7. The T8 was more efficient in increasing GMD in the 10-20 cm soil depth than the other treatments. The T1 was more efficient in improving the evaluated soil physical and chemical attributes than T7. The use of NTS with plants of the Poaceae and Fabaceae families in single or intercrop systems for onion production resulted in higher TOC and TN contents in the 0-5 and 5-10 cm soil depths compared to CTS.

Multiple cropping of rubber inter-rows prior to canopy closure is being suggested as a way of enhancing an early return on investment. A two-year study was conducted at the Rubber Research Institute of Nigeria (RRIN), Iyanomo from 1988 to 1999, to evaluate the agronomic significance and economic potentials of utilizing resources in the vast inter-rows of young rubber plantations. The experiment involved inter-cropping of one, two, three and four crops selected from cowpea, soybean, melon, maize and cassava with young rubber. The most robust girth of rubber samplings was observed in the rubber + soybean + melon and rubber + melon + maize systems, with 2.25 cm and 3.66 cm, respectively, in the 1998 and 1999 seasons. Young rubber in the rubber + cowpea system had the highest height increment rate of 9.91cm/month. The area harvest equivalent ratio (AHER) showed a comparative advantage of multiple cropping over sole cropping. Rubber + melon had the highest AHER of 2.41 while rubber + soybean had the least value of 1.20 among the intercrops. The highest net benefit of N102,782 with a marginal-net-benefit of N49,803 and NI 17,587 with a marginal-net-benefit of N79,974 in 1998 and 1999 were observed in the rubber + melon + cassava and rubber + soybean + cassava cropping systems, respectively. All of the cropping systems had marginal rates of return in excess of the minimum 100 percent, except the sole rubber and rubber + melon cropping systems during the 1998 season.

Testing pearl millet and cowpea intercropping systems under high temperatures	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Adaptation; High temperatures; Intercropping; Vigna unguiculata; Pennisetum glaucum"	"PLANT-DENSITY; YIELD; DROUGHT; SORGHUM; MAIZE; COMPETITION; RATIO; SOIL"	"With the potential threat of more frequent climate extremes putting semi-arid crop production in jeopardy, there is a need to establish more climate resilient cropping practices. Intercropping is often practiced by farmers in semi-arid regions and is perceived as a risk reducing practice. However, there is little knowledge of how and to what extent it can be a viable option under future conditions. As testing a complex adaptation strategy in controlled environments is difficult, conducting field experiments in the dry season offers opportunities to test cropping systems under extreme but real-world conditions. Consequently, a field trial was run in semi-arid India over a two-year period (2015 and 2016) in the dry and hot (summer) season. These trials were set up as a split split-plot experiment with four replicates to assess the performance of simultaneously sown sole versus inter cropped stands of pearl millet and cowpea, with two densities (30 cm and 60 cm spacing between rows-both with 10 cm spacing within rows), and three water treatments (severe stress, partial stress, and well-watered) applied with drip irrigation. Results showed that intercropping pearl millet led to a significantly lower total grain yield in comparison to the sole equivalent. Pearl millet's highest yields were 1350 kg ha(-1) when intercropped and 2970 kg ha(-1) when grown as a sole crop; for cowpea, 990 kg.ha(-1) when intercropped, and 1150 kg ha(-1) as a sole crop. Interestingly, even when maximum daily temperatures reached up to 42.2 degrees C (on Julian day 112 in 2016), well-watered, pearl millet produced reasonable yields. Cowpea yields were often lower than 1000 kg ha(-1). Only under the highest irrigation treatment (well-watered) sole cropped, low density were yields of 1150 and 1110 kg ha(-1) achieved in 2015 and 2016, respectively. We conclude that successful intercropping systems must be highly specific to conditions and demands. More research would be needed to identify suitable cowpea genotypes and planting densities that could allow for higher intercropped pearl millet yields."	"[Nelson, W. C. D.; Hoffmann, M.

Aqueous leaf extracts and leachates of all the test plants caused significant inhibition of zoospore germination. Aqueous extract of Persian lilac and leachate of eucalyptus were found to be highly effective and inhibited zoospore germination of P colocasiae by >94.0%. Mulching delayed the appearance of disease by 5-9 days over unmulched plots. Mulching with leaves and twigs of eupatorium was found to be highly effective in delaying the disease, in reducing the terminal disease severity, and enhancing the corm yield, whereas, that with pea crop refuse was least effective. Intercropped taro had less disease than the pure crop. Two rows of all intercrops except okra when grown alternately with one row of taro, were found to be more effective than a single row of intercrops in reducing the disease. Single and double rows of okra as intercrop was ineffective in managing the disease. Amongst the different intercrop-taro combinations, taro intercropped with sorghum and pearl millet as a single row or double rows were more effective in managing the disease.	"[Sugha, S.

However, little information is available on how waxy sorghum canopy light environment is affected by row ratio configurations in waxy sorghum-soybean intercropping systems. Hence, field experiments were conducted in 2019 and 2020 to study the responses of photosynthetic characteristics, dry matter formation, and yield performance of waxy sorghum to seven treatments: sole waxy sorghum (SW), sole soybean (SS), two rows of waxy sorghum alternated with one row of soybean (2W1S), two rows of waxy sorghum alternated with two rows of soybean (2W2S), three rows of waxy sorghum alternated with one row of soybean (3W1S), three rows of way sorghum alternated with two rows of soybean (3W2S), and three rows of way sorghum alternated with three rows of soybean (3W3S). The results showed that intercropping increased the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and leaf area index (LAI) of waxy sorghum compared to SW treatment. This increase in PAR and LAI increased the photosynthetic characteristics of waxy sorghum canopy, including chlorophyll content (SPAD value), net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs), transpiration rate (Tr), and stomatal limitation value (Ls). These changes resulted in increased dry matter accumulation, its distribution, and promoted the dry matter transportation from vegetative organs to grain in waxy sorghum. Likewise, intercropping increased the grain number per spike and 1000-grain weight of waxy sorghum, and ultimately increased the land equivalent ratio (LER). Moreover, the 2W1S treatment showed the most suitable light environments and greatest resource utilization to obtain the highest LER and economic benefits. Based on the present results, we suggested that the 2W1S should be used as optimal row ratio configuration of waxy sorghum-soybean system to attain maximum benefits.

Production costs can be more competitive by increasing yields so that overhead costs are applied to more biomass. Most previous economic studies of energy crops have concentrated on the production of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.). This study analyzes the biomass yield and economic potential of several high-yielding annual and perennial crops on prime and marginal, sloping land. Crops evaluated were reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) harvested twice per year; switchgrass and big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman var. gerardii); alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.); and sweet sorghum, forage sorghum [both Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], and maize (Zea mays L.). The intercropping of the two sorghum species into reed canarygrass and alfalfa was also analyzed. All crops but alfalfa were fertilized with 0, 70, 140, or 280 kg N ha(-1), with economic analysis performed assuming 140 ka N ha(-1). Sorghums were most productive, with more than 16 t of dry matter ha(-1). Switchgrass was the highest-yielding perennial crop, Costs per ton of biomass produced were lowest for sorghum, somewhat higher for switchgrass, higher still for big bluestem, and highest for alfalfa and reed canarygrass. Yields per ton for intercropped species were higher than for perennial species but lower than for monocrop sorghum. Costs per ton for intercropped species were less than for either alfalfa or reed canarygrass, but were higher than costs per ton of monocrop sorghum. Although the sorghums had the highest yields, high potential for erosion on sloping soils may preclude their use on these soils. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."

This study aimed to assess the effect of intercropping on soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and its nitrogen (N) regulation. Methods The potato was monocropped and intercropped with maize under four N levels (0, 62.5, 125 and 187.5 kg ha(-1) for N0, N1, N2 and N3, respectively) in a fixed plot experiment from 2014 in subtropical China. Soil DOC concentration was determined and seasonal and interannual dynamics were analyzed from 2016 to 2018; Absorption values of specified wavelength were selected to characterize the annul DOC composition. Finally, the driving factors of DOC variation were explored using structural equation modeling (SEM). Results Soil DOC concentration and accumulation under N-applied treatments were higher than N0 and the increase peaked at N1. Compared with monocropping, intercropping significantly increased DOC accumulation by 20.29% only at N0. N application significantly improved the contents of amines and aromatic compounds and the average molecular weight of DOC, thus improving the degree of humification and aromatization of soil DOC. The SEM showed that the chemical composition of DOC was complicated with increasing soil temperature, aboveground and root biomass, while DOC concentration and chemical composition significantly affected the accumulation of DOC. Conclusions Agricultural diversified cropping affects the dynamics and composition of soil DOC, which is intensively regulated by N fertilization. This study expands the insight into the variable DOC concentration and composition and its role in soil organic carbon turnover under the varying fertilization and cropping patterns."

J	"Sharma, OP; Gupta, AK"				"Sharma, OP; Gupta, AK"			Nitrogen-phosphorus nutrition of pearlmillet as influenced by intercrop legumes and fertilizer levels	JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION			English	Article							"PEARL-MILLET; MAIZE"	The results of a field experiment revealed that pearlmillet (PM) (Pennisetum glaucum L.) as a sole crop accumulated significantly less concentrations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and protein in grain and stover as compared to that when it was grown with legumes. Of the three legumes (clusterbean, cowpea, and mungbean) cowpea was least effective in increasing the nutrient contents of PM. The highest N and P uptake by grain and stover was recorded in PM + clusterbean system, which was significantly greater than that in PM + cowpea system. Application of 100% of the recommended dose of nutrients separately to PM and legumes (M100I100) significantly enhanced the N and P contents of grain and stover of PM over all other fertility levels. The grain yield of PM did not decrease even when the amount of N was curtailed by 25% (M75I100). Nevertheless, the highest uptake of N and P was observed in intercropped PM receiving M100I100. Higher uptake was due to the fact that the nutrient concentrations increased to a greater extent than the yields. Summarily, the data demonstrated that PM being grown with clusterbean or mungbean and supplied 100% of recommended dose of nutrients separately to PM and legumes were essential to improving the yield and quality of pearlmillet.

Bipolaris maydis is a non-adapted pathogen affecting soybeans, particularly of maize/soybean intercropping systems. However, no experimental evidence has described the immune response of soybeans against B. maydis. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying NHR in soybeans, proteomics analysis based on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was performed to identify proteins involved in the soybean response to B. maydis. The spread of B. maydis spores across soybean leaves induced NHR throughout the plant, which mobilized almost all organelles and various metabolic processes in response to B. maydis. Some enzymes, including ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP), oxygen evolving enhancer (OEE), and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDKs), were found to be related to NHR in soybeans. These enzymes have been identified in previous studies, and STRING analysis showed that most of the protein functions related to major metabolic processes were induced as a response to B. maydis, which suggested an array of complex interactions between soybeans and B. maydis. These findings suggest a systematic NHR against non-adapted pathogens in soybeans. This response was characterized by an overlap between metabolic processes and response to stimulus. Several metabolic processes provide the soybean with innate immunity to the non-adapted pathogen, B. maydis. This research investigation on NHR in soybeans may foster a better understanding of plant innate immunity, as well as the interactions between plant and non-adapted pathogens in intercropping systems.

The aim of the present work was to analyse the relationships between plant architecture and light partitioning within wheat-pea (Triticum aestivum-Pisum sativum) mixtures. An existing model for wheat was utilized and a new model for pea morphogenesis was developed. Both models were then used to assess the effects of architectural variations in light partitioning. Methods First, a deterministic model (L-Pea) was developed in order to obtain dynamic reconstructions of pea architecture. The L-Pea model is based on L-systems formalism and consists of modules for 'vegetative development' and 'organ extension'. A tripartite simulator was then built up from pea and wheat models interfaced with a radiative transfer model. Architectural parameters from both plant models, selected on the basis of their contribution to leaf area index (LAI), height and leaf geometry, were then modified in order to generate contrasting architectures of wheat and pea. Key results By scaling down the analysis to the organ level, it could be shown that the number of branches/tillers and length of internodes significantly determined the partitioning of light within mixtures. Temporal relationships between light partitioning and the LAI and height of the different species showed that light capture was mainly related to the architectural traits involved in plant LAI during the early stages of development, and in plant height during the onset of interspecific competition. Conclusions In silico experiments enabled the study of the intrinsic effects of architectural parameters on the partitioning of light in crop mixtures of wheat and pea. The findings show that plant architecture is an important criterion for the identification/breeding of plant ideotypes, particularly with respect to light partitioning.

Growth rate, dry matter yield, and N uptake were determined in each intercropping system. Furthermore, several indices were used to evaluate the intercropping systems and analyze the competition and the interrelationships between mixture components. Growth rate of cereals was lower in the mixtures than in the monocrops. Dry matter yield was higher in triticale monocrop, followed by its two intercrops, and the pea-wheat 80:20 intercrop. Moreover, triticale monocrop, pea-triticale intercrops, and pea-wheat 80:20 intercrop showed the highest crude protein yield and N uptake. The land equivalent ratio (LER), relative crowding coefficient (K), actual yield loss (AYL), and system productivity index (SPI) values were greater for the pea-triticale mixtures and the pea-wheat and pea-rye mixtures (80:20), indicating an advantage of intercropping. In most intercrops, the values of partial K. AYL, aggressivity, and competitive ratio (CR) indicated that the cereal was more competitive than pea. The highest values of monetary advantage index (MAI) and intercropping advantage (IA) were recorded for the pea-triticale and the pea-wheat mixtures (80:20). Overall, pea-triticale and pea-wheat mixtures (80:20) were more productive and produced better forage quality than the other mixtures and thus could be adopted by the farmers as alternative options for forage production.

Capture and efficiency in the use of water and radiation in double-cropped wheat-soybean	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"double crop; wheat; soybean; resource use efficiency; radiation; water; intercropping; sustainability; rainfall"	"TRANSPIRATION EFFICIENCY; LIGHT INTERCEPTION; RESOURCE CAPTURE; YIELD; NITROGEN; GROWTH; MONOCULTURE; SUNFLOWER; CARBON"	The production of dry matter and grain depends on the ability of crops to capture resources. On an annual basis, farming systems centred on single crops waste large proportions of key inputs including incoming solar radiation and rainfall. Intensive farming involving multiple crops per year could improve resource capture and productivity. Resource productivity is defined as the ratio between output (biomass or grain yield) and annual input of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) or rainfall. This paper tested the hypotheses that (i) wheat-soybean (Triticum aestivum L. and Glycine max (L.) Merr., respectively) double cropping increases resource productivity in relation to single crops through improved capture and efficiency in the use of resources, and (ii) the link between radiation- (RUE) and water-use efficiency (WUE) previously established for sole crops remain when scaling up to double cropping. Sequential and relay wheat-soybean double crops were compared with sole crops during 2 years in the south-eastern Pampas of Argentina. Water and radiation productivity (RP) were analysed as the product between proportion of resources captured by crops and the efficiency in the use of resources to produce plant material, i.e. RUE, and WUE. Responses of resource productivity to cropping strategy were generally similar for dry matter and grain yield. Differences between sequential and relay wheat-soybean double crops were minor. On an annual basis (i.e. from I May to 30 April), both water and RP were higher in double crops than in sole crops. This was largely related to improved capture of resources. On a seasonal basis (i.e. from sowing to physiological maturity), however, double and sole crops had similar water productivity whereas RP was lower for double crops, intermediate for soybean and higher for wheat. The impact of double cropping on resource capture was much larger for water than for radiation. The fraction of annual precipitation captured by crops increased from 0.26 to 0.51 in sole crops to 0.53 to 0.71 in double crops, whereas the capture of annual PAR increased from 0.24 to 0.31 to 0.38 to 0.44. The differential impact of double cropping on the capture of resources reflects the difference between storable (water) and non-storable resources (radiation). In agreement with our proposition, water use efficiency was closely associated with radiation use efficiency. For our conditions, further improvement in farming systems based on multiple cropping should target practices to enhance capture of radiation. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Herbage samples were taken at different stages of growth for separation of component crops (peas and wheat) and estimation of dry matter (DM) content, DM yield, chemical composition and in vitro digestible organic matter in DM (DOMD). The DM yields generally increased with maturity and the average bi-crop IDM yields was highest in Year 3. Peas had higher crude protein (CP) and DOMD but lower neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) than wheat. For both peas and wheat, the DM, CP, starch, NDF and DOMD at harvest were higher in the second cut (15 weeks after planting) than in the first cut (13 weeks after planting). The DM yield, CP, starch, WSC, NDF, ADF content of the bi-crops and their DOMD yields were all influenced by the stage of maturity and the proportion of peas to wheat in the bi-crops. The results show that inter-cropped spring sown pea/wheat bi-crops can be harvested between 13 and 16 weeks after planting. However, relative to other stages of maturity measured, harvesting when the wheat was at early to soft dough stage and the peas at yellow wrinkle pod stage appeared optimal. In comparison with the pea variety Magnus, the lower NDF and ADF, and higher CP, WSC, starch and DOMD in the pea variety Setchey suggests that the latter is nutritionally better. In deciding when to harvest, the chemical composition and stages of growth of both peas and wheat are important. However, because there is little decline in the quality of peas with maturity, it may be possible, in certain conditions (e.g. absence of lodging, infections or senescence in peas), to use the stage of maturity of wheat only as the index of the ideal time to harvest pea/wheat bi-crop for conservation as forage for ruminants.

The econometric results suggest that there was no gender heterogeneity in the adoption of PPT after controlling for the manager of the field-plot and plot characteristics. However, gender differences in the adoption pattern of some other SAPs were evident. Jointly-managed plots were more likely to receive animal manure and soil and water conservation measures compared to male-managed and female-managed plots. We did not find any gender differences in the adoption of maize-grain legume intercropping, crop rotation, fertilizer use and improved maize seeds. The analysis further showed a significant correlation between PPT and other SAPs, suggesting that the adoption of agricultural technologies is interrelated. Lack of evidence on gender differences suggests that promotion and dissemination of PPT can be supported equally for male and female cereal farmers. Wider adoption can be achieved through promoting awareness of the technology and offering training through field days.

Deep Neural Networks and Transfer Learning for Food Crop Identification in UAV Images	DRONES			English	Article						"remote sensing; crop analytics; crop mapping; UAVs; machine learning; convolutional neural networks; deep learning; smallholder systems"	CLASSIFICATION	Accurate projections of seasonal agricultural output are essential for improving food security. However, the collection of agricultural information through seasonal agricultural surveys is often not timely enough to inform public and private stakeholders about crop status during the growing season. Acquiring timely and accurate crop estimates can be particularly challenging in countries with predominately smallholder farms because of the large number of small plots, intense intercropping, and high diversity of crop types. In this study, we used RGB images collected from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) flown in Rwanda to develop a deep learning algorithm for identifying crop types, specifically bananas, maize, and legumes, which are key strategic food crops in Rwandan agriculture. The model leverages advances in deep convolutional neural networks and transfer learning, employing the VGG16 architecture and the publicly accessible ImageNet dataset for pretraining. The developed model performs with an overall test set F1 of 0.86, with individual classes ranging from 0.49 (legumes) to 0.96 (bananas). Our findings suggest that although certain staple crops such as bananas and maize can be classified at this scale with high accuracy, crops involved in intercropping (legumes) can be difficult to identify consistently. We discuss the potential use cases for the developed model and recommend directions for future research in this area.

By using permeable (100 mu m) and impermeable (solid) root barriers in a multi-site field experiment, we aimed to study the impact of root-root interactions on nutrient accumulation, soil microbial communities, crop yield, and economic returns in a peanut/cotton IC system under non-saline, secondary-saline, and coastal saline soil conditions of China. Results The results indicate that IC decreased the peanut pods yield by 14.00, 10.01, and 16.52% while increased the seed cotton yield by 61.99, 66.00, and 58.51%, respectively in three experimental positions, and consequently enhanced the economic returns by compared with monoculture of peanut (MP) and cotton (MC). The higher accumulations of nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) were also observed in IC not only in the soil but also in vegetative tissues and reproductive organs of peanut. Bacterial community structure analysis under normal growth conditions reveals that IC dramatically altered the soil bacterial abundance composition in both peanut and cotton strips of the top soil whereas the bacterial diversity was barely affected compared with MP and MC. At blossom-needling stage, the metabolic functional features of the bacterial communities such as fatty acid biosynthesis, lipoic acid metabolism, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and biosynthesis of ansamycins were significantly enriched in MP compared with other treatments. Conversely, these metabolic functional features were dramatically depleted in MP while significantly enriched in IC at podding stage. Permeable root barrier treatments (NC-P and NC-C) counteracted the benefits of IC and the side effects were more pronounced in impermeable treatments (SC-P and SC-C). Conclusion Peanut/cotton intercropping increases crop yield as well as economic returns under non-saline, secondary-saline, and coastal saline soil conditions probably by modulating the soil bacterial abundance composition and accelerating plant nutrients accumulation."

Effects of heat and high irradiance stress on energy dissipation of photosystem II in low irradiance-adapted peanut leaves	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						"Arachis hypogaca; D1 protein; energy dissipation; heat and HI stress; relay-intercropped peanut; xanthophyll cycle"	"XANTHOPHYLL CYCLE; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; D1 PROTEIN; SYSTEMS; PHOTOINHIBITION; PRODUCTIVITY; REPAIR; MAIZE; YIELD"	To increase crop yields and not to compete for land with food crops, intercropping agricultural cultivation approach was introduced into cultivation of peanut (Arachis hypogaca L.). This approach improves the total yield of the crop per unit area, but decreases the yield of a single crop compared with mono-cropped agricultural cultivation approach. In wheat-peanut relay intercropping system, peanut plants would suffer heat and high light (HI) stress after wheat harvest. In the present work, peanut seedlings were cultivated in low light to simulate wheat-peanut relay intercropping environments. Upon exposure to heat and HI stress, energy dissipation in PSII complexes was evaluated by comparing those cultivated in low irradiance conditions with the mono-cropped peanut. The maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (F (v)/F (m)) and the net photosynthetic rate (P (n)) decreased markedly in relay-cropped peanut (RP) after heat and HI stress, accompanied by higher degree of PSII reaction center closure (1-qP). After heat and HI stress, higher antioxidant enzyme activity and less ROS accumulation were observed in mono-cropped peanut (MP) seedlings. Meanwhile, higher content of D1 protein and higher ratio of (A + Z)/(V + A + Z) were also detected in MP plants under such stress. These results implied that heat and HI stress could induce photoinhibition of PSII reaction centers in peanut seedlings and both xanthophyll cycle-dependent thermal energy dissipation and the antioxidant system were down-regulated in RP compared to classical monocropping systems after heat and high irradiance stress.

A New Approach for Analyzing and Interpreting Data on Fruit Drop in Mango	HORTSCIENCE			English	Article						"fruit retention; intercropping; irrigation; Mangifera indica; plant growth regulator"	"MANGIFERA-INDICA L.; HILLSIDE TRIALS; GROWTH; ABSCISSION; IRRIGATION; YIELD; TREES; MECHANISMS; RETENTION; TRINIDAD"	"Mango yields are frequently reduced by premature fruit drop, induced by plant stresses during the fruit set period in response to unsuitable climatic or crop management conditions. There are varying strategies for assessing premature fruit drop, which render the comparison and interpretation of published data difficult to draw general conclusions. Therefore, the objective was to provide a mathematical model that is generally valid for describing fruit losses of mango. The model was tested and validated by monitoring the fruit drop for the two local North Vietnamese cultivars, Hill and Trim, in different management systems over six consecutive growing seasons: 1) mango maize intercropping and mango monocropping; 2) irrigation; and 3) plant growth regulator applications with 10 ppm N-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-N' -phenylurea (CPPU), 40 ppm 17 naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), and 40 ppm gibberellins (GA(3) and GA(4+7)). The timely pattern of fruit drop was best described with a sigmoid function (r(2) = 0.85) and formed the basis for defining three distinct drop stages. The post-bloom drop, from full bloom to the maximum daily rate of fruit drop [FD(x)], had the highest fruit losses. The following midseason drop stage ends at 1% FD(x), a threshold that is suggested after a comprehensive literature review. Thereafter, during the preharvest drop stage, treatment and cultivar differences appear to remain constant despite continued fruit drop. In contrast to other mango intercropping studies, fruit loss was not greater in the mango maize intercropping than in the mango monocropping. Irrigation resulted in approximately three times higher fruit retention compared with the non-irrigated control. A single application of NAA at marble fruit stage (BBCH-scale 701) resulted consistently in the highest fruit retention for both cultivars in midseason and at harvest. The model permits the separation between the drop stages, thus allowing the evaluation of 1) natural variation before treatment effects during post-bloom drop; 2) treatment efficacies during midseason drop; and 3) yield forecasting at the beginning of the preharvest stage."

Crop response to elemental S and sulfate-S sources on S-deficient soils in the parkland region of Alberta and Saskatchewan	JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION			English	Article						"annual; application time; crop yield; elemental S; fertilizers; one-time initial; placement method; residual effect; sulfate-S; S uptake"	"SULFUR FERTILIZERS; INCUBATED SOILS; RECOVERY; CANOLA; TILLAGE; YIELD; TIME"	Six field experiments were conducted on sulfur-(S) deficient Gray Luvisol (Typic Cryoboralf) and Dark Gray Chernozem (Typic Cryoborolls) soils at various locations in Alberta and Saskatchewan to evaluate the effectiveness of elemental S (ES-90, ES-95, Urea S, Fine S Powder), sulfate-S (ammonium sulfate, sodium sulfate), and elemental S + sulfate-S (Sulgro-68, Agrium Plus) fertilizers, and their rates and placement methods on seed yield and S uptake of canola and barley, and forage dry matter yield of pure bromegrass and bromegrass-alfalfa mixed stands. There was a substantial increase in yield and/or S uptake from sulfate-S application in most experiments. This indicated that the soils used in these experiments were deficient in plant-available S, especially for canola. In the initial year, the performance of elemental S fertilizers was usually inferior to sulfate-S fertilizers. Among the elemental S fertilizers, the ES-95 tended to produce greater yield and S uptake than ES-90. In general, there was no difference in seed yield between early (May 1) and late (May 23) spring applications for the elemental S (Urea S). The results indicated that from the second or third year of initiating annual applications the effectiveness of some elemental S fertilizers almost approached the level of sulfate-S fertilizers. Residual effect of S application lasted for at least three years. Overall, the findings suggest that correction of a severe S deficiency by elemental S alone may be risky in the short term, and thus addition of some sulfate-S in the initial 1 or 2 years to supplement the sulfate-S from elemental S is advisable. Increased exposure of elemental S fertilizers to oxidation either by incorporation and broadcast methods or by application ahead of plant use time tends to improve crop response.

In order to contribute to the establishment of the nitrogen balance sheet for fertilisation recommendation of subsequent main crop at field scale, this supply is currently derived from the biomass production, classically estimated visually using 3 classes: 0?1, 1?3, 3+ tons of dry matter per hectare (Mg DM ha-1). The capabilities of Sentinel-2 satellite data to retrieve an operator-independent winter cover crop biomass have been assessed. Biomass samples were collected in 1 m quadrats for various types of winter cover fields classically used in Belgium (mustard, phacelia, oat and a range of mixed cover), in 2016 and 2017 (yield between 0.1 to 5 tons of dry matter per hectare). Empirical relationships between the winter cover crop biomass and a wide range of vegetation indices (VIs) derived from Sentinel-2 have been defined, and the most performant VI identified. For pure stands of winter cover crops, the cross-validation RMSE (CVRMSE) of the best model is 0.36 Mg DM ha-1 for mustard and 0.3 Mg DM ha-1 for phacelia. The CVRMSE observed for mixed stands, around 0.61 Mg DM ha-1, is roughly two times higher than the CVRMSE observed for pure stands. The added-value of objective satellitebased estimation of winter cover biomass was also assessed by comparing respective estimations with regards to an independent reference dataset made of sample measurements on the ground. Models based on Earth observation showed better results than farmer visual assessment for mustard crops, and were as good as farmers for phacelia crops.

However, the community effects of an important and widespread group of generalized parasites, the parasitic plants, have been poorly studied. I performed removal experiments to assess the role of a small annual hemiparasite, Triphysaria pusilla (Scrophulariaceae), in a California coastal prairie community. Removal of Triphysaria led to increased total biomass of the host assemblage; this effect was largely attributable to a substantial increase in the biomass of graminoids. In addition, host suitability differed dramatically among three annual taxa: Triphysaria parasitizing grass hosts produced 3.2 and 6.4 times more fruits, on average, than those attacking two dicot hosts, Hypochaeris glabra and Lupinus nanus, respectively. Availability of multiple host species failed to improve parasite performance beyond that achieved on grasses alone. Triphysaria impacts also differed greatly among host species: natural densities of Triphysaria significantly reduced the dry mass of grasses, while Hypochaeris and Lupinus were unharmed. In addition to these direct effects, I tested whether Triphysaria attack influenced competitive interactions among host taxa. Natural densities of grasses significantly reduced growth and fecundity of Hypochaeris and Lupinus, suggesting that the presence of Triphysaria in mixed stands of hosts might allow competitive release of these dicot species. However, the combination of grasses and Triphysaria caused a more severe reduction in Lupinus performance than that caused by grasses alone. Thus, observations of direct effects among pairs of species were not sufficient to explain either the outcome or intensity of multi-species interactions. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that a generalist plant parasite can influence the structure of a natural plant community, and that interactions between a generalist parasite and its multiple host species can be difficult to predict from studies that consider only single host taxa."

Considerable information is available on the effects of different environmental stresses; however, the effect of shade at various development stages on the accumulation of the various seed constituents remains elusive. We investigated the effect of shade application on anthocyanin, PA, and sucrose contents at different seed development stages of two black soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] varieties. This study comprised two separate trials: maize-soybean relay intercropping (IC) and soybean monoculture. The shade treatments in the soybean monoculture trial comprised shade applications at whole growth stage, at vegetative stage (SV), and at reproductive stage (SR) and a no-shade control. Anthocyanin, PA, and sucrose contents were analyzed from seeds obtained at development stages of full-size seed (R6), physiological maturity (R7), full maturity, 95% mature pods on the plant (R8), and natural air dry (AD). Genotype, shade, and planting season and their interactions had a strong influence on anthocyanin, PA, and sucrose accumulation in soybean seeds at the different seed development stages. Among all the shade treatments, relay IC recorded the highest anthocyanin contents in 2017 (1.88 mg g(-1)) and 2018 (1.76 mg g(-1)) in AD seeds. In addition, the application of shade increased PA, and maximum PA (27.14 mg g(-1)) was obtained in the SV treatment at R6 stage. The overall best sucrose contents (6.14 mg g(-1) in 2017 and 7.04 mg g(-1) in 2018) were obtained in soybean seeds harvested at R8 under SV treatment."

EFFECTS OF AN INTERCROP-BASED CONSERVATION BENCH TERRACE SYSTEM ON RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND CROP YIELDS IN A SUB-HUMID CLIMATE IN INDIA	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						"C Factor; Conservation bench terrace (CBT); Curve number; Intercropping system"	"WATER; SOIL"	The performance of an intercrop-based conservation bench terrace (CBT) system for controlling runoff and soil erosion and improving crop productivity in comparison to the conventional system of farming on sloping borders was evaluated in a sub-humid climate. Analysis of runoff and soil loss data revealed that the CBT system reduced runoff and soil loss by about 80% and 88%, respectively, compared to the conventional system, thus signifying a drastic reduction. The results of storm analysis suggest that the CBT system was very effective in reducing runoff and soil loss from storms of all sizes as compared to the conventional system. The major part of runoff (81.2%) in the conventional system was contributed by storms of less than 75 mm, whereas 88.8% of runoff in the CBT system was contributed by storms greater than 75 mm. The CBT system responded mainly to large storms due to the storage effects in the impoundment (recipient) area. The storage abstraction mechanism in the CBT system was further verified by event-based hydrograph analysis, drawing an inference that abstraction is a major factor in peak discharge attenuation due to storage routing. A comparison of the performance of an intercrop system with a monocrop system established the superiority of the former in reducing runoff and soil loss and improving crop productivity. The SCS curve number (CN) method was employed to standardize CN and initial abstraction values for both intercrop and monocrop based CBT and conventional systems. The initial abstraction term was estimated as 0.44 for CBT, as compared to 0.0156 for the conventional system of sloping borders. The CN values for intercrop-based CBT and conventional systems were estimated as 62 and 63, respectively, compared to 71 and 74 for monocrop-based systems. Predictive relationships between runoff and soil loss in both the CBT and conventional systems were established. The C factor of USLE was estimated as 0.31 and 0.28 for intercrop-based conventional and CBT systems, respectively, which can be utilized as a standard factor for estimation of soil loss for a system using USLE-based simulation modeling. Analysis of crop yield data revealed that the CBT system was about 18% more productive than the conventional system in terms of maize equivalent yields, primarily due to better in situ rainwater conservation. It is thus concluded that the intercrop-based CBT system is an economically viable alternative to the conventional system of sloping borders in conserving natural resources of soil and water and improving crop productivity in a sub-humid climate.

However, information about the biomass production and decomposition of such species in the region is still scarce, especially for cover crop species in consortium. The experiment was conducted in Nao-Me-Toque, RS, on an Oxisol, evaluating nine treatments of four cover crops in monoculture [rye (Secale cereale L.), oat (Avena strigosa Schreb), pea (Pisum sativum subsp. arvense), and wild radish (Raphanus sativus L. var. oleiferus Metzg)] and five in intercropping [(rye + pea, radish + rye, oat + radish, rye + vetch (Vicia sativa L.) and oat + vetch)]. The decomposition dynamics of cover crop residues was evaluated in litter bags which were distributed on the soil surface and collected after seven, 14, 21, 28, 57, 117, and 164 days. Leguminous and cruciferous intercropped with Gramineae species resulted in greater biomass production compared to cultivation in monoculture. The nitrogen (N) accumulated in the pea and wild radish plants intercropped with rye and oat was similar to the N in the leguminous and cruciferous monocultures and exceeded the N values observed for the Gramineae species in monoculture by 220.4 %. By intercropping cover crops it was possible to reduce the decomposition rate of crop residues compared to the monoculture of leguminous and cruciferous species.

Mineral N is essential to produce adequate mustard stands, however, significant N additions are inhibitory to N2 fixation. Yield and N2 fixation studies characterized the response of pea and mustard in sole and intercrop conditions at four fertilizer N concentrations (10, 30, 60 and 90 kg N ha-1). The yield of peas and LERs of the intercrop did not increase with increasing N rates. The mustard yields increased with N rate in sole-crop but not in intercrop plots. Seasonal patterns of nitrogenase activity and total N, fixation estimates in pea were made using acetylene reduction assays and the N-15 isotope dilution technique, respectively. Nitrogenase activity early in the growing season was negatively correlated with N rate in both years. In 1990, nitrogenase activity increased later in the season in the treatments receiving 30 or 60 kg N ha-1 In 1991, the inhibition of nitrogenase activity with increasing N rate was sustained throughout the season. N-15 studies aimed at quantifying total N2 fixation indicated no significant response to N rate in 1990 and a negative correlation to N rate in 1991.

Push-pull technology (PPT) is an agronomic package designed to reduce the effects of Striga and stemborers on maize and sorghum production. As PPT is promoted in new areas, including Ethiopia, there is a need to review the evidence that the technology helps farmers mitigate or adapt to climate change. Furthermore, proponents need to consider whether tasks associated with establishing and maintaining PPT may worsen existing gender burdens. We assess whether PPT is climate- and gender-smart based on a review of 40 publications that included field experiments or farmer surveys. We find strong evidence that intercropping with drought-tolerant Desmodium effectively reduces Striga abundance and enhances grain yield. Although gender influences PPT adoption, there is a lack of knowledge about additional labor requirements for women. We recommend research focusing on 1) the efficacy of PPT under different climate conditions, 2) optimal timing of planting push and pull species; 3) evaluation of fodder outputs; 4) water requirements associated with establishment; and 5) implications for gender burden across cultural contexts. We suggest a participatory approach that integrates farmers' perspectives to support climate mitigation, adaptation, and gender equity."

Purposive and multi-stage random sampling techniques were used to select one hundred and twenty (120) cassava farmers. Data were collected through a structured questionnaire and analyzed with descriptive statistics such as: frequency counts, mean scores and percentages. The result revealed that 60% of the respondents were males, with mean ages of 51.2 years, 35% acquired secondary education, mean farming experience of 26.7 years, mean annual farm income of (sic)278, 275.00 and extension contact ((X) over bar= 2.2) times in a month. Result reveals that farmers adopted cassava agronomic practices as; improved cassava cuttings ((X) over bar =4.7), ridge/mound making technologies practices ((X) over bar= 4.6), site selection /land clearing and weeding interval technologies ((X) over bar= 4.3), pest and disease control ((X) over bar =4.2) and planting dates and time of harvest ((X) over bar =3.9) with a grand mean adoption score of 4.3. The farmers also adopted intercrop technologies as; cassava/maize/egusi ((X) over bar =4.3) and cassava/maize/telferia and cassava value addition ((X) over bar =4.2) with a grand mean adoption of 3.4. The levels of utilization of cassava production technologies on agronomic practices indicate that the respondents utilized site selection/land clearing and ridge/mound making ((X) over bar =2.8), improved cassava cuttings, fertilizer application and weeding technologies ((X) over bar =2.7) and pest and disease control and planting spacing ((X) over bar =2.4) with grand mean utilization score of 2.6.

Soil of experimental field was medium deep black with low in organic carbon, low in available nitrogen, medium in available phosphorus and high in available potassium.The experiment was laid out in split plot design with three main plot treatments and four sub plot treatments. The gross and net plot sizes are 7 .2x5.4m(2) and 5.4x3.6m(2) respectively. The pigeonpea variety BDN-711 was used for sowing with spacing 90 x 20 cm. The main plot treatments were three land configurations as (L-1) broad bed furrow (BBF), (L-2) ridges and furrow and (L-3) flat bed method. Sub plot treatments were four intercropping systems i.e. (I-1) pigeonpea + soybean (2:1), (I-2) pigeonpea + green gram (2:1), (I-3) pigeonpea + black gram (2:1) and (I-4) pigeonpea + cowpea (2:1). It was observed that seed yield of pigeon pea and pigeonpea equivalent yield were significantly affected due to different land configuration and intercropping systems. The highest pigeonpea seed yield (1588 kg ha(-1)) and pigeonpea equivalent yield (1823 kg ha(-1)) were obtained with Broad bed furrows (L-1) followed by ridges and furrow (L-2) Among the intercropping systems, pigeonpea + greengram intercropping system (I-2) recorded higher seed yield (1574 kg ha(-1)) and pigeonpea equivalent yield(1832 kg ha(-1)). Periodical soil moisture observations in different land configuration considering depth of soil, higher average soil moisture was recorded under broad bed furrow followed by ridges and furrows while lesser was recorded under flat bed sowing.

The nifH gene abundance in oat-soybean intercropping (OSO) and oat-mungbean intercropping (OMO) was significantly greater than that in sole oat (O), but the nifH gene abundance significantly decreased at the later stage in all the treatments. Alpha diversity indices in OSO and OMO were higher at the heading stage, but lower at the maturity stage than that in O. Bradyrhizobium and Skermanella were the dominant genera identified in all samples, with an average proportion of 35.8% and 12.4%, respectively. The proportion of dominant genera showed significant differences and varied with cropping system and growth stage. Principal component analysis showed that growth stage had a stronger effect than intercropping on the diazotrophic community structure. However, Mantel test and redundancy analysis showed there was no environmental factor significantly correlated to the diazotrophic community structure. Our results demonstrate that intercropping had a weaker effect than growth stage on the abundance, diversity and structure of the diazotrophic community in oat rhizosphere soil.

Nevertheless, the relationship between the effect of different harrowing intensities using spike-tooth harrow in barley-pea intercrop on the yield and mycoflora of grains has not yet been studied. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of harrow intensity using spike-tooth harrow in barley-pea mixture on the mycological quality of harvested grains, grain yield, as well as influence of barley and pea grain moisture on the abundance of fungi. The field experiment was carried out during 2010-2012, and it was conducted using a randomized complete block design with four replicates. Weed control was mechanical and chemical. In this study, we have shown that harrowing in barley-pea intercrops does not reduce the yield of either mixture components, both with respect to grain quantity or mycological quality after harvest, compared to controls-without harrowing and the herbicide MCPA (2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid). However, increasing the intensity of harrowing did not result in a consistently larger crop yield or reduction in fungal abundance in the grains. The grains' internal structures and surface of both tested components of the mixture were colonized to a large extent by cosmopolitan fungi, of which Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissl. was the most abundant.

The factor examined in the experiment was percentage of yellow lupine seeds and spring triticale grain in sown mixtures: 100/0, 75/25, 50/50, 25/75 and 0/100, respectively. Yellow lupine yield was reduced by spring triticale when intercropped. In the yield of both plants the percentage share of spring triticale grain was larger and that of yellow lupine seed was smaller than in the sown mixture. Land equivalent ratio informs that yield advantage under intercropping of lupine and triticale was minor. The total protein yield was the highest in lupine cultivation when sown pure, and decreased with increasing share of triticale in their intercropping. The mean percentage nitrogen share from N-2 fixation, fertilizer and soil reserves in yellow lupine mass was: 65.2, 8.8 and 26.0%, respectively, while in the mass of spring triticale it was 10.1, 23.5 and 68.8%, respectively.

Asch.] cultivars were grown in pure stands and interspecific, binary mixtures under Mediterranean conditions for two growing seasons (2011-12 and 2012-13). The aim of the work was to identify traits contributing to the complementary use of soil nitrogen (N) and water in intercrops. Such traits could be used as putative selection criteria for cultivars well-adapted to intercropping systems. The N-15 natural abundance method was used to assess the percentage of N derived from N-2-fixation (%N-dfa) in pure stands and intercrops and the percentage of N transferred from pea to oat (%N-trans) in intercrops. Carbon isotope discrimination (Delta(pea), Delta(oat)) was used as an assessment of water use efficiency. Isotope determinations were conducted when 30% of pea flowers were open. Dry matter yield (DM) of pure stands and intercrops was estimated at forage silage maturity of peas, and forage quality traits (protein, fat, ash, crude fiber, and nitrogen free extracts concentrations) were measured. Intercropping either increased or decreased %N-dfa depending on the cultivars included in the mixtures. High %N-dfa by pea in mixtures was associated with a high contribution of pea in the mixture and high crude protein concentration in DM. High amounts of fixed N and N accumulated in pea were necessary to maximize protein concentration and protein yield in intercrops. These amounts were calculated to be 72.0 and 94.4 kg N h(-1) for protein concentration and 124.2 and 160.8 kg N ha(-1) for protein yield. Oats in intercrops seemed to affect the N niche of peas. Delta(oat) values were positively correlated with %N-dfa, the amount of fixed N in pea and the amount of N accumulated in pea. A plausible explanation for this is that high Delta(oat) values were indicative of a better access to soil water and nitrate (NO3-N) sources through a deeper and denser rooting system, thus increasing the competition on the companion pea which led to higher percentage of N-2-fixation and consequently to higher amounts of N fixed by and accumulated in pea. High-Delta oats were less dependent on N transferred from pea as was indicated by a negative correlation between these two traits. As a consequence, high Delta(o)(at) values were associated with high protein concentration and protein yield. In contrast, Delta(pea) values were negatively correlated with protein concentration and protein yield. Peas, having a less competitive rooting system compared to oats, were adaptive to intercropping when they had a more conservative use of soil water (lower Delta(pea)), and thus avoided competition. Land equivalent ratios for dry matter yield (LERDM) and protein yield (LERCPY) were affected by growing seasons. LERDM was < 1.00 (0.88) in 2012-13 growing season indicating that intercropping was not favored. This season was characterized by lack of precipitation during December 2012 and January 2013, high precipitation in February ( > 62% of season's water input) and mild temperatures during winter (November to February). The very early, moderately tall oat cultivar Flega had the highest LER values, regardless of the companion pea cultivar. This was an indication that Flega was favored by growing in intercrops, however, Flega's mixtures were not among the high-yielding mixtures.

This work was aimed to study the effectiveness of peppermint/soybean intercropping patterns on the yield, quality of peppermint essential oil, competition and monetary indices in two years (2015-2016) and two harvests. The experiment was conducted in randomized complete block design keeping ratio of peppermint and soybean in 1:1, 1;2, 2:1, 2:3, 3:2, 1:3 and 3:1, respectively, along with sole plot of both crops. The results demonstrated that the highest biomass yield of peppermint in the first harvest was achieved in sole cropping pattern (317.2 g m(-2)) followed by 3:2, 3:1, 2:3 and 2:1 intercropping ratios. In the second harvest, the highest biomass yield of peppermint was recorded in peppermint monoculture (289.1 g m(-2)) and intercropping ratios of 3:2 and 3:1. In both harvests, the highest essential oil content and yield was obtained in the intercropping ratio of 3:2. Notably, the intercropping patterns gave 24.8% (first harvest) and 16.9% (second harvest) more essential oil than peppermint monoculture. Furthermore, the essential oil quality, in terms of high levels of menthol, 1,8-cineole, neo-iso-menthol, p-menth-1-en-9-ol, (E)-caryophyllene, (E)-beta-famesene and germacrene D and low content of menthofuran, improved significantly in intercropping treatments. The highest values of land equivalent ratio (LER), area time equivalent ratio (ATER), area harvest equivalent ratio (AHER), land use efficiency (LUE), monetary intercropping advantage (MAI) and system productivity index (SPI) were obtained in intercropping ratios of 2:3 and 3:2. Additionally, in all planting patterns the partial aggressivity (A) and crowding ratio (CR) values of peppermint were higher than soybean, indicating that the former was more competitive than the latter. According to our results, intercropping peppermint with soybean can improve the quality of peppermint essential oil and maintaining the crop productivity with limited external inputs; thus, this technique can be considered to be a sustainable practice for field management."

The influence of nitrogen (N) fertilization and sowing ratio on concentrations and uptake of calcium (Ca), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg) and phosphorus (P) by oat and pea was assessed in three substitutive intercrops on a fertile soil in eastern Austria. N decreased Ca in oat grain and increased P in pea grain as well as Ca and Mg in oat residue and Mg and P in pea residue. Intercropping did not affect nutrient concentrations of oat grain, whereas a lower pea share in intercrops increased P in pea grain. In residue, Ca, K and Mg concentrations were higher in oat and Ca and K partly lower in pea with a lower share of each crop. The oat-dominated intercrops could partly achieve a slightly higher total grain nutrient yield than pure stands at no or low N; however, these benefits diminished with a higher pea share and N input. In comparison to pure stands, higher residue nutrient yields were obtained by intercropping in all sowing ratios and fertilization levels. Consequently, oat-pea intercropping can be a strategy for increasing the macronutrient yield of grain and especially of residue for ruminant feeding."

However, it is hard to produce soybean stably with this system, since the growth of soybean plants is slower under shading by corn at the seedling stage, and it is compensated by accelerated growth after the symbiotic stage. Soybean plants show excessive vegetative growth due to more rain during the flowering stage, which results in fallen petals, fallen pods and lower yield. This study investigated whether seed treatment with uniconazole powder (0, 2, 4 and 8 mg kg(-1) seed) suppresses excessive vegetative growth of soybean plants during the flowering stage and delays senescence of photosynthetically active leaves at the pod-setting stage. If such events are correlated with changes in photosynthesis, they may affect dry matter accumulation and seed yield in the relay stripping system. Uniconazole promoted biomass accumulation from 31 (R-3) to 61 (R-5) days after flowering (DAF) and seed yield. Seed treatment with uniconazole raised the net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, and total chlorophyll and chlorophyll a contents. In contrast, uniconazole reduced leaf area index (LAI) from 1 DAF (R-1) to 46 DAF (R-4) with the increase in uniconazole concentration, whereas, uniconazole significantly increased LAI at 61 DAF and the greatest promotion occurred at 2 mg kg(-1) treatment. The study clearly showed that uniconazole effectively suppressed excessive vegetative growth of soybean during flowering stage, delayed senescence of photosynthetically active leaves at pod-setting stage and induced higher yield, which were related to the changes in photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll content, dry matter accumulation and LAI in the relay strip intercropping system.

Leafed (13) and semi-leafless (U) forage pea (Pisum sativum L.) cultivars and triticale (xTriticosecale Wittmack) were sown as monocrops and in different forage pea:triticale mixture ratios (75:25, 50:50, 25:75) and harvested at booting and milk-dough stage of triticale. Considering the total digestible dry matter and crude protein yields of the treatments together, it was observed that T-75:U-25, T-50:U-50, T-75:U-25 mixtures harvested at milk-dough stage of triticale produced high yields. In addition, leafed forage pea was found to be more aggressive than semi-leafless cv. in all mixtures.

Pasture cropping with C-4 grasses in a barley-lupin rotation can increase production	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE			English	Article						"plant competition; pasture-cropping; over-cropping; barley; lupin; C4 grass; Mediterranean environment"	"FARMING SYSTEMS; AUSTRALIA; PERFORMANCE; LUCERNE; YIELD"	"In southern Australia, intercropping, pasture cropping and overcropping have evolved as techniques to address environmental problems such as dryland salinity and wind erosion and to utilise soil water outside the conventional winter-dominant growing season. We paired three winter-dormant pastures, including two subtropical C-4 perennial species (Rhodes grass, Chloris gayana; Gatton panic, Megathyrsus maximus) and the summer-active perennial C-3 legume siratro (Macroptilium atropurpureum), with a conventional barley (Hordeum vulgare)-lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) rotation to explore the extent to which different summer-active species reduced crop yields. We also examined whether the competition for resources could be altered by supplying increased nitrogen to the crop and changing the row spacing of the pasture. Under high-input conditions, pasture reduced cereal crop yields by up to 26% and lupin yields by up to 29%. Under low-input conditions, pasture cropping did not significantly reduce crop yield, and frequently increased crop yields. With low inputs, barley yield increases in 2011 ranged from 23% to 31%. In lupins under low-input conditions, yield increases ranged from 91% to 106% in 2010 and from -6% to +39% in 2012. The impact of the crop on the pasture was less pronounced, where the timing of pasture growth was delayed by the crop, but absolute levels of production were not influenced by the crop. Row spacing altered the temporal dynamic of pasture production; initially, the pasture produced less than the narrow spaced equivalent, but after 2 years, production exceeded that in the narrow row. Across all pasture species in 2009 and 2012, winter pasture production reduced crop yield by 0.32 and 0.4 t grain/ha pasture biomass produced, implying that moderate yield losses occurred because pasture production was also moderate. In the other two years, winter pasture production did not affect crop yield, suggesting that the pasture was able to utilise resources surplus to crop requirements. In this environment, with this combination of crops and summer-active pastures, higher levels of inputs did not enhance crop yield in a pasture-cropping system. We suggest that grain yield losses are lower in the low-input system and this implies that, at some level, competition between the species was reduced in a nitrogen-limited environment and the extent of the competition depended on season."

This study compared and evaluated the relevance in understanding intercrop functioning of some well-known indices (aggressivity, AG; cumulative relative efficiency index, REIc: land equivalent ratio, LER) and other potentially useful indices (change in contribution, CC: interspecific and intraspecific interaction index, IE and IA: comparative absolute growth rate, CGR). Data collected from a two-year field experiment in SW France with different fertiliser N levels comparing wheat (Triticum turgidum L. cv. Nefer) and pea (winter pea, Pisum sativum L, cv. Lucy) grown as sole crops or intercrops in a row substitutive design were used to calculate, compare and evaluate the relevance of the selected indices for understanding intercrop functioning. It was found that AG indices (calculated with or without considering sowing density or actual plant density) did not provide the information generally claimed in the literature (i.e. whether a crop is dominant or dominated). Consequently, their use is clearly unadvisable except when analysed jointly with partial land equivalent ratios. The LER index proved to be clearly relevant, versatile and helpful in illustrating the pattern of competitive outcomes in intercropping experiments, in particular when plotting partial LER values of wheat as a function of those of pea. However, LER cannot identify intraspecific and interspecific interactions. To do so we suggest using the intraspecific and interspecific interaction indices, which can also reveal possible facilitation phenomena and allow description of species change in the contribution index (CC). Interaction dynamics between crops that determine the final balance and the outcome of all competitive interactions occurring between the two crops can be evaluated using the CGR index, which is preferable to REIc, particularly when crops differ greatly in their dry weight. Careful choice of index and interpretation of the results are thus essential in correctly understanding species interactions (globally and dynamically) and intercrop efficiency compared with sole crops. Such indices can help highlight and reveal cereal and legume traits suited to intercropping and also appropriate cropping sequences and management techniques, allowing efficient intercropping. However, the results must always be related to actual data values (yield, dry weight or N accumulated) because the indices used cannot evaluate intrinsically quantitative performance but only the relative performance of intercrops compared with that of sole crops.

It might gradually increase the surface under no-till in Europe. The release dynamics of nutrients from the crop residues left on the soil surface has rarely been studied under Mediterranean climate conditions. As part of a long-term experiment started in 1982, a field study was carried out during the agricultural seasons 2001/2, 2002/3 and 2003/4, to determine the decomposition and nutrient release of above-ground residues deposited on a clayey soil in the south of Spain, in which a legume-cereal-sunflower rotation was followed. At the end of its decomposition cycle, the pea residue (Pisum sativum L. cv. Ideal) had lost 60% of its initial mass, durum wheat (Triticum durum L. cv. Amilcar) 35%, and sunflower (Helianthus annus L. cv. Sanbro) 39%. The N release by the pea residue, wheat and sunflower was of 13.5, 6.7 and 8.5 kg ha(-1), respectively. The P release was of 2.9 kg ha(-1) (pea) and of 0.7 kg ha(-1) (sunflower), and the highest content of released K was noted in the sunflower residue, 78 kg ha(-1), compared to 22.5 kg ha(-1) in wheat and 2.4 kg ha(-1) in pea. In pea and sunflower, residue loss and N and P release in most cases followed simple linear and exponential functions, from which the specific decay rates were calculated. The decomposition rates of the different nutrients were higher than those of the residue in pea and sunflower, and the residue semi-decomposition periods, of 138 d in sunflower, and 191 d in pea, indicated a great persistence of the remains. The soil protection was acceptable in the case of wheat and sunflower, but not in pea. The application of the Douglas-Rickman model and the knowledge of the variation in the concentration of the nutrient in the crop remains permitted the estimation of the amount of N and P remaining in them over the intercropping period. In any case, in our climate and with soils rich in K, the release of nutrients from the residue, mainly N, is fairly scant and, in principle, does not seem to be of any interest in the fertilization programmes followed by the farmers in the area.

The aim of our study was to test whether a durum wheat-winter pea intercrop can improve relative yield and durum wheat grain protein concentration in low-N-input systems. A 2-year field experiment was carried out in SW France with different fertilizer-N levels to compare wheat (Triticum turgidum L., cv. Nefer) and pea (winter pea, Pisum sativum L., cv. Lucy) grown as sole crops or intercrops in a row-substitutive design. Without N fertilization or when N was applied late (N available until pea flowering less than about 120 kg N ha(-1)), intercrops were up to 19% more efficient than sole crops for yield and up to 32% for accumulated N, but were less efficient with large fertilizer N applications. Wheat grain protein concentration was significantly higher in intercrops than in sole crops (14% on average) because more N was remobilized into wheat grain due to: i) fewer ears per square metre in intercrops and ii) a similar amount of available soil N as in sole crops due to the high pea N-2 fixation rate in intercrops (88% compared to 58% in sole crops).

This study sought to determine the effectiveness of wheat intercrop mixtures in suppressing weeds and diseases and increasing grain yield and net return. Field experiments were conducted on organically managed land in 2004 and 2005 and three representative intercrop systems were tested: wheat with other cereals [oats (Avena sativa L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and spring rye (Secale cereale L.)]; wheat and noncereal seed crops (flax [Linum usitatissimum L.], field pea [Pisum sativum L.], oriental mustard [Brassicajuncea L.]); and wheat and cover crops (red clover [Trifolium pratense L.], hairy vetch [Vicia villosa L.], annual ryegrass [Lolium multiflorum Lam.]). The cereal intercrop systems provided no consistent yield benefit over wheat monocultures. Results from noncereal-wheat intercrops were variable. Wheat-flax reduced the wheat crop to unacceptable levels but was capable of reducing wheat flag leaf disease levels. Wheat-field pea resulted in the lowest disease levels, yet had inconsistent yields, and more weeds than wheat monoculture. Wheat-mustard did riot reduce weeds or diseases, but it was capable of high grain yields and net returns, though usually hampered by flea beetle (Phyllotreta cruciferae) attack. The effect of cover crops on wheat was affected by environment. Wheat-red clover and wheat-hairy vetch did demonstrate the ability to maintain high wheat grain yield in certain site-years. In conclusion, wheat intercrop mixtures provided little short-term benefit over monoculture wheat in this study."

The crop rotation was pea and barley sole and intercrops followed by winter-rye and a fallow period. The Land Equivalent Ratio (LER), which is defined as the relative land area under sole crops that is required to produce the yields achieved in intercropping, was used to compare intercropping performance relative to sole cropping. Crops received no fertilizer in the experimental period. Natural N-15 abundance techniques were used to determine pea N-2 fixation. The pea-barley intercrop yielded 4.0 Mg grain ha(-1), which was about 0.5 Mg lower than the yields of sole cropped pea but about 1.5 Mg greater than harvested in sole cropped barley. Calculation of the LER showed that plant growth resources were used from 17 to 31% more efficiently by the intercrop than by the sole crops. Pea increased the N derived from N-2 fixation from 70% when sole cropped to 99% of the total aboveground N accumulation when intercropped. However, based upon aboveground N accumulation the pea-barley intercrop yielded about 85 kg N ha(-1), which was about 65 kg lower than sole cropped pea but about three times greater than harvested in sole cropped barley. Despite different preceding crops and removal or incorporation of straw, there was no significant difference between the subsequent non-fertilized winter-rye grain yields averaging 2.8 Mg ha(-1), indicating an equalization of the quality of incorporated residue by the NO3- leaching pattern. NO3- leaching throughout the experimental period was 61 to 76 kg N ha(-1). Leaching dynamics indicated differences in the temporal N mineralization comparing lysimeters previously cropped with pea or with barley. The major part of this N was leached during autumn and winter. Leaching tended to be smaller in the lysimeters originally cropped with the pea-barley intercrops, although not significantly different from the sole cropped pea and barley lysimeters. Soil N balances indicated depletion of N in the soil-plant system during the experimental period, independent of cropping system and residue management. N complementarity in the cropping system and the synchrony between residual N availability and crop N uptake is discussed.

Merr.]-wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori & Paol.), sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]-wheat and soybean-sorghum-wheat. Among different combinations of organic and inorganic, application of 75% NPK + 5 tonnes farmyard manure/ha recorded the highest protein (34.93%), oil yields (17.87%) and mineral content (4.93%) in soybean, and highest protein (9.90%) and mineral (1.66%) contents were obtained in sorghum, both in intercropping as well as in sole cropping, though these were at par with other organically treated plots (phosphocompost and poultry manure) and 100% NPK plot. Intercropping system as such had no influence on nutritional quality in both soybean and sorghum. However, wheat grains produced under legume-cereal cropping system (soybean-wheat) accumulated higher carbohydrates (71.8%), proteins (12.2%), methionine (1.48g/16gN) and tryptophan content (1.37g/16gN) as compared to grains produced under cereal-cereal cropping system (sorghum-wheat).

An experiment was carried out at two sites in 1993 and 1994 to investigate the effects of seeding date (simultaneous with corn or 3 weeks later) and number of rows of large-seeded legumes (one or two) seeded between the corn rows. The intercrop plots received 90 kg ha(-1) less nitrogen fertilizer than the monocrop plots, which received 180 kg ha(-1). Silage yields were sometimes decreased by the simultaneous seeding of corn and large-seeded legumes. Protein content and concentration were not affected by most treatments and provided reasonable quality silage, despite a reduction in the amount of nitrogen fertilizer used.

Weed community responses were examined in a corn-soybean intercrop in southwestern Michigan, USA, with and without nitrogen fertilization. Weed suppression was observed when intercropping was additive, but the depression in above-ground weed biomass was not due to a synergistic effect of crop diversity, but rather to the effects of crop density and identity. Intercropping did not have a greater suppressive effect than monocrops on weed biomass in a replacement intercrop when crop densities were similar to those in monocultures. Similarly, intercropping per se did not alter the diversity, species richness or composition of the weed community. The presence and density of corn was more important in affecting the weed community than was the density of soybeans or than intercropping itself. Fertilization and the interaction between fertilization and crop type had few effects on the weed community.

To help develop a strategy to manage this pest and associated viruses in three vegetable crops in the Egyptian agricultural system, experiments on several cultural techniques were conducted. Cultural practices of mulching with white polyethylene, intercropping with maize (Zea mays L.), and crop rotation with maize resulted in reduced whitefly populations and reduced incidences of viruses in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), squash (Cucurbita pepo L.) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). However, no benefit in whitefly abundance and virus incidence was obtained from modifying the planting time by one month earlier than standard planting. There was a high correlation between whitefly abundance and virus incidence. Based on viral symptoms, up to 75 % infection was observed in untreated plots, while most of the treated plots had less than 40 % infection. The viruses affecting the crops were Cucumber vein yellowing virus in cucumber, Squash leaf curl virus in squash, and Tomato yellow leaf curl virus in tomato; they are common problems in Egypt. The first-mentioned virus is caused by an Ipomovirus in the family Potyviridae while the other two are Begomovirus in the family Geminiviridae. The cultural management strategies utilized in this study are viable tools to help manage B. tabaci and associated viruses in vegetable crops."

However, our understanding of the role of different cropping systems in regulating the abundance and diversity of ground- and soil-dwelling insect herbivores (pests) and arthropod predators (natural enemies of pests), and thus cascading effects on biological pest control services is still poor. To address this important issue, we measured ground- and soil-dwelling insect pests and associated arthropod natural enemies in fields of MM, WM, and MWI using pitfall traps and hand-sorting in spring and summer at six sites in a desert agroecosystem in northwestern China. Each site contained three cropping systems with cultivation for at least five years. We also calculated the abundance- and richness-based ratios of ground- and soil-dwelling arthropod predators to insect herbivores (P: H ratios) as indices for assessing pest biocontrol services. For ground-dwelling communities, we found that MM harbored more abundant and diverse insect herbivores and insect predators than the other systems, whereas MWI harbored more abundant and diverse non-insect predators and had higher P: H ratios compared with the other systems across seasons. For soil-dwelling communities, we found that MM harbored more abundant and diverse insect herbivores than MWI in spring, whereas WM harbored less abundant and diverse insect herbivores than the other systems in summer. However, MWI harbored more abundant and diverse insect predators than the other systems, whereas WM harbored less abundant and diverse non-insect predators than the other systems in either season. Moreover, MM harbored more abundant and diverse non-insect predators than MWI in summer. The P: H ratios were higher in MWI than in MM and WM in spring, but did not differ across cropping systems in summer. Our results demonstrate that the magnitude and direction of the effects of cropping systems are highly season specific and vary across groups of ground- and soild-welling herbivores and predators. Furthermore, intercropping delivers greater pest biocontrol services than monoculture systems. These findings provide key insights towards developing more effective intercropping systems for pest suppression.

In the field plot test, the land equivalent ratio (LER) of cassava-peanut intercropping system was 1.43, showing obvious intercropping yield advantage. Compared with monocropping, Cd contents in the roots of cassava and seeds of peanut were significantly reduced by 20.00% and 31.67%, respectively (p < 0.05). Under the unit area of hectare, compared with monocropping of cassava and peanut, the bioconcentration amount (BCA) of Cd in the intercropping system increased significantly by 24.98% and 25.59%, respectively (p < 0.05), and the metal removal equivalent ratio (MRER) of Cd was 1.25, indicating that the intercropping pattern had advantage in Cd removal. In the cement pool plot test, compared with the control, cassava inter-cropped with peanut under biochar and crushed straw additions did not only enhance the available nutrients and organic matter contents in rhizosphere soil but also promoted the crop growth and increased the content of chlorophyll (SPAD values) of plant leaves. The peanut seeds biomass under biochar and straw additions were significantly increased by 112.34% and 59.38% (p < 0.05), respectively, while the cassava roots biomass under biochar addition was significantly increased by 63.54% (p < 0.05). Applying biochar significantly decreased the content of Cd which extracted by diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA-Cd) in soil and reduced Cd uptake as well as translocation into plant tissues. The BCA of Cd of cassava under biochar addition decreased significantly by 53.87% in maturity stage (p < 0.05), thus reduced the ecological risk of Cd to crops and was of great significance to produce high quality and safe agricultural products. Besides, the crushed straw enhanced the biomass of crops, reduced Cd content in all tissues and maintained Cd uptake in the intercropping system. Therefore, it can realize the integration of ecological remediation and economic benefit of two energy plants in Cd contaminated soil after applied crushed straw in cassava-peanut intercropping system.

Mechanized direct-planted wheat-rice sequential cropping was developed at the Aichi Prefecture Agricultural Research Center by intercropping them for two months in spring. An objective of this study was to evaluate the introduction of continuous no-tillage to the cropping system with emphasis on water stress. The water source of intercropped wheat was also elucidated using deuterated heavy water to analyze water competition between crops. Continuous no-tillage of wheat-rice direct planting was performed for six seasons (three years) in an experimental small paddy field. No-tillage resulted in a doubled soil penetration resistance in the surface layer of soil, indicating the risk of suppressing root development. The higher yield of wheat in the dry plot suggested that excess-moisture stress occurs in the field. In the no-tillage plot, light transmission to intercropped rice seedlings increased significantly due to the reduced wheat biomass production. Wheat and rice yields were not statistically lowered by the no-tillage practice. This indicated that it is possible to introduce continuous no-tillage to the cropping system. The no-tillage significantly increased the deuterium concentrations in the xylem sap in wheat after the application of simulated rainfall with deuterated water. This indicated that the water uptake dependency of wheat shifted from stored soil water to recently applied water, which suggested the higher competition between the crops may occur under no-tillage conditions.

J	"Huang, JX; Chen, YQ; Sui, P; Gao, WS"				"Huang, Jianxiong; Chen, Yuanquan; Sui, Peng; Gao, Wansheng"			Estimation of net greenhouse gas balance using crop- and soil-based approaches: Two case studies	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"Global warming; Agroecosystem; Carbon sequestration; Net greenhouse gas balance; Comparison; China"	"ECOSYSTEM CARBON BUDGET; ORGANIC-CARBON; CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION; NO-TILLAGE; SYSTEMS; N2O; SEQUESTRATION; FLUX; EMISSIONS"	The net greenhouse gas balance (NGHGB), estimated by combining direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, can reveal whether an agricultural system is a sink or source of GHGs. Currently, two types of methods, referred to here as crop-based and soil-based approaches, are widely used to estimate the NGHGB of agricultural systems on annual and seasonal crop timescales. However, the two approaches may produce contradictory results, and few studies have tested which approach is more reliable. In this study, we examined the two approaches using experimental data from an intercropping trial with straw removal and a tillage trial with straw return. The results of the two approaches provided different views of the two trials. In the intercropping trial, NGHGB estimated by the crop-based approach indicated that monocultured maize (M) was a source of GHGs (-1315 kg CO2-eq ha(-1)), whereas maize-soybean intercropping (MS) was a sink (107 kg CO2-eq ha(-1)). When estimated by the soil-based approach, both cropping systems were sources (-3410 for M and -2638 kg CO2-eg ha(-1) for MS). In the tillage trial, mouldboard ploughing (MP) and rotary tillage (RT) mitigated GHG emissions by 22,451 and 21,500 kg CO2-eq ha(-1), respectively, as estimated by the crop-based approach. However, by the soil-based approach, both tillage methods were sources of GHGs: -3533 for MP and -2241 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) for RT. The crop-based approach calculates a GHG sink on the basis of the returned crop biomass (and other organic matter input) and estimates considerably more GHG mitigation potential than that calculated from the variations in soil organic carbon storage by the soil-based approach. These results indicate that the crop-based approach estimates higher GHG mitigation benefits compared to the soil-based approach and may overestimate the potential of GHG mitigation in agricultural systems.

The plants were grown in the following variants: a mixture, pure sowing, higher density (recommended in agricultural practice) and density reduced by 20%. Observations were performed in the following wheat development growth stages (BBCH): leaf development (12-14), tillering (21-23), stem elongation (31-32), inflorescence emergence (54-56) and ripening (87-89). The experiment included determinations of dry matter in different parts of plants (aerial organs, roots) and of the nitrogen content in dry matter. Based on the results, the total nitrogen content was determined in both species. The data were also used to calculate nitrogen translocation from the wheat vegetative mass to grain, and to calculate selected competition indicators. It was demonstrated that - regardless of the density of plants - the nitrogen uptake by spring wheat and Persian clover in the mixed sowing was lower than in the pure sowing treatment. Mixed sowing caused a more limited nitrogen uptake by the aerial parts of both species than by their roots. No impact was demonstrated of the plant density on the nitrogen uptake by different parts of spring wheat. Persian clover in pots with the lower sowing density absorbed less nitrogen than in pots with the recommended density. Nitrogen translocation from the vegetative parts to the grain of spring wheat between the inflorescence emergence and ripening stages was more effective in the mixture than in the pure sown plants. In mixed sowing, after nitrogen uptake, wheat proved to be a stronger competitor than Persian clover during the whole plant growing period.

Wilczek, was carried out for two crop seasons (July to October 2001 and 2002) at the Agronomy Farm and the Department of Agricultural Zoology and Entomology of Rajasthan College of Agriculture, Maharana Pratap University of Agriculture & Technology, Udaipur, India. The efficacy of Azadirachta indica A. Juss oil and malathion, as first application against aphids, jassids and whiteflies was significantly lower under sole crop of V. radiataI than when it was inter-cropped with maize during both years (2001 and 2002). Among the different treatment schedules as third application, endosulfan was most effective against the pod borers (Maruca testulalis Geyer and Lampides boeticus L.) in both sole crop and the intercrop. During the two-year study (2001 and 2002), the maximum yield of maize and green gram in the inter-cropped pattern and that as sole crop of green gram, as well as the maximum rupee equivalent yield value was recorded for the management schedule comprising release of Chrysoperla carnea 25 DAS, spray of A. indica oil 40 DAS and endosulfan 55 DAS. The lowest yield of V. radiata was recorded under the management schedule comprising three release of Chrysoperla carnea Stephen at 25, 40 and 55 DAS irrespective of the cropping pattern.

An interview schedule was used to collect data from a sample of 135 farmers. Results show that co-farmers and farm broadcast were the major sources of information to greater proportion of the farmers. Data on relevance of the technologies disseminated showed that almost all the technologies were perceived to be relevant except processing of tomatoes into paste and pure and snail farming. The radio farmer programme enhanced the extent of adoption of six technologies namely; modern land preparation and planting of early season crop, harvesting of yam and storage in barn, site selection/bush burning/packing, processing of cocoyam into chips and flour, improved early maize cultivation, weeding and fertilizer application in yam + cassava + maize intercrop and pest control in the food crop farms. Nevertheless, the adoption of the technologies were generally low. Age, farming experience and social participation significantly influenced adoption of improved agricultural technologies disseminated via radio farm programme. Major constraints identified include short duration of programme, inappropriate scheduling of programme, inability to ask relevant questions and get feed back from the radio presenter and language used in presenting the programme. The study recommends among other things the rescheduling of the radio programme to very late in the evenings when the farmers will be opportune to listen to the programme."	"[Agwu, A. E.; Ekwueme, J.

J	"Mahe, I; Gauvrit, C; Angevin, F; Chauvel, B"				"Mahe, Ines; Gauvrit, Christian; Angevin, Frederique; Chauvel, Bruno"			What lessons can be learned from the atrazine ban in the context of the future withdrawal of glyphosate?	CAHIERS AGRICULTURES			French	Review						"herbicide; weed; regulations; weeding control; pollution by agriculture"	RESISTANCE	Over the past seventy years, some herbicides have become keystone active ingredients in weed management. In France, until 2003, atrazine played a key role for maize weeding. Since 1974, glyphosate has become the most used herbicide for intercropping period management and has become central for conservation agriculture. Such exceptional efficiency and a low cost placed atrazine and glyphosate among the most used herbicides worldwide. In either case, their over-use has contributed to water pollution and to the emergence of questions about possible negative effects on the environment. An agronomical, economical and societal comparison between the withdrawal of atrazine and glyphosate showed similar concerns of agricultural sector about weed management. The withdrawal of atrazine may have increased costs of maize weeding, but weed communities have been successfully managed, mainly thanks to the use of other chemical ingredients. The possible glyphosate ban, planned in France in a near future, may have strong impacts on weed management and more generally on farm operations. The main available alternative to glyphosate is soil tillage, but other agronomical practices have to be associated to maintain an effective weed management. Although 15 years apart, the withdrawal of these two active ingredients allows to put emphasis on the impacts that a massive use of a unique chemical ingredient can have on the environment and on the adaptability of agricultural systems.

J	"Hamzei, J; Seyyedi, M"				"Hamzei, Javad; Seyyedi, Mohsen"			Energy use and input-output costs for sunflower production in sole and intercropping with soybean under different tillage systems	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH			English	Article						"Energy profitability; Glycine max L.; Helianthus annuus L.; Intercropping; Land use efficiency; Yield performance"	"USE EFFICIENCY; COMPETITIVE ABILITY; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; APRICOT PRODUCTION; CROPPING SYSTEMS; FARMING SYSTEMS; WINTER-WHEAT; COMMON VETCH; CORN; MAIZE"	Agriculture is an important energy user and energy supplier in the form of bio-energy. In today's agricultural practices, soil tillage and applications of chemicals are the greatest consumers of energy and labor. Therefore, selection of an appropriate tillage method and finding an efficient way for decreased consumption of chemicals can improve energy use and reduce costs. The pre-requisite for such improvements includes assessment of the system's energy balance. Moreover, intercropping can play an important role in improving yield and reducing energy consumption. To compare the effects of different tillage treatments on energy use and grain yield in a sunflower-soybean intercropping system, a field experiment was performed on a clay loam soil at the Agricultural Research Station, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Bu-Ali Sina, Hamedan, Iran, during the growing seasons of 2013 and 2014. Three levels of tillage, as the main factor, and different planting patterns were tested in sub-plots (sole crop of sunflower, sole crop of soybean, and additive intercroppings of sunflower +30%, 60% and 90% soybean). The intercropping design was additive. Results showed that sunflower grain yield was significantly affected by the planting pattern. Tillage treatments did not have significant effects on the sunflower yield. The highest sunflower grain yield (356.22 g m(-2)) was obtained from the sole crop of sunflower. Furthermore, amongst intercropping treatments, the highest sunflower grain yield (302.44 g m(-2)) was achieved from the combination of sunflower +60% soybean. Also, comparison of the combined treatments indicated that the highest energy output (248363 MJ ha(-1)) and energy use efficiency (7.44) were reached with the combinations of conventional tillage x sunflower +90% soybean, and minimum tillage by disc x sunflower +90% soybean, respectively. In conclusion, using minimum tillage and intercropping system of sunflower +60% soybean can decrease energy consumption and increase total yield and land use efficiency when compared to sunflower sole crop under conventional tillage.

Therefore, the uptake of 26 PFASs in plants and the contamination of soil and groundwater has been investigated at a fire training site at Stockholm Arlanda airport, Stockholm (Sweden) in 2016. Elevated Sigma(26)PFAS levels were detected in soil and groundwater ranging from 16 to 160 ng g(-1) dry weight (dw) and 1200-34 000 ng L-1, respectively. Samples from different plant species and tissues (i.e., roots, trunk/cores, twigs, leaves/needles) of the local plant community were taken, namely silver birch (Betula pendula), Norway spruce (Picea abies), bird cherry (Prunus padus), mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia), ground elder (Aegopodium podagraria), long beechfern (Phegopteris connectilis), and wild strawberry (Fragaria vesca). The plants showed a high variability of concentrations with highest Sigma(26)PFAS concentrations in vegetative compartments with up to 97 ng g(-1) wet weight (ww) and 94 ng g-1 ww in birch leaves and spruce needles, respectively. Annual ground cover plants such as long beechfern and ground elder, and bushes like bird cherry showed concentrations up to 6.9, 23, and 21 ng g(-1) ww, respectively. The bioconcentration factors (BCFs; plant/soil ratios) were highest in foliage, while the total tree burden of Sigma(26)PFASs per tree was up to 11 mg for birch and 1.8 mg for spruce. Considering a shelterwood system with mixed stands of silver birch and spruce in combination with regular harvest of leaves and birch sap and an understory of ground elder, it is potentially feasible to remove 1.4 g of Sigma(26)PFASs per year and hectare from (heavily) contaminated sites. An alternative approach is the coppicing of birch trees in combination with an understory of ground elder, potentially removing 0.65 g yr(-1) ha(-1) of Sigma(26)PFASs, while a simple meadow with ground elder can remove 0.55 g yr(-1) ha(-1) Sigma(26)PFASs."

J	"Daryanto, S; Wang, LX; Jacinthe, PA"				"Daryanto, Stefani; Wang, Lixin; Jacinthe, Pierre-Andre"			Global synthesis of drought effects on cereal, legume, tuber and root crops production: A review	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Review						"Drought; Cereal; Legume; Tuber; Meta-analysis; Climate change"	"WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; GRAIN-YIELD; SOIL-TEMPERATURE; HEAT-STRESS; SOYBEAN CULTIVARS; GENETIC-VARIATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MAIZE GROWTH; DURUM-WHEAT; TOLERANCE"	As a result of climate change, drought is predicted to pose greater pressure on food production system than in the past. At the same time, crop yield co-varies with both environmental (e.g., water, temperature, aridity) and agronomic variables (i.e., crop species, soil texture, phenological phase). To improve our quantitative understanding on the effects of these co-varying factors on agricultural productivity, we synthesized previous meta-analysis studies summarizing the results of numerous independent field experiments on drought and its effect on the production of cereal, legume, root and/or tuber (root/tuber) crops. We also included new crops species that were not covered in previous meta-analyses and the effects of heat stress. Our results indicated that cereals tended to be more drought resistant than legumes and root/tubers. Most crops were more sensitive to drought during their reproductive (i.e., grains filling, tuber initiation) than during their vegetative phase, except for wheat, which was also sensitive during vegetative phase. Recovery from drought impact at reproductive phase was either: (i) unfeasible for crops experiencing damage to their reproductive organs (e.g., maize, rice) or (ii) limited for root/tuber crops, provided that water was abundant during the subsequent root/tuber bulking period. Across soil texture, the variability of yield reduction for cereals was also lower in comparison to legume or root/tuber crops, probably due to the extensive and deep rooting system of cereal crops. As crop species, plant phenology, and soil texture were important co-varying factors in determining drought-induced crop yield reduction, no single approach would be sufficient to improve crop performance during drought. Consequently, a combination of approaches, particularly site-specific management practices that consider soil conditions (i.e., intercropping, mulching, and crop rotation) and selection of crop varieties adjusted to the local climate should be adopted in order to improve the sustainability of agricultural production in a changing climate.

J	"Wortmann, CS; Stewart, Z"				"Wortmann, Charles S.; Stewart, Zachary"			Nutrient management for sustainable food crop intensification in African tropical savannas	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	"Article; Early Access"							"INTERCROP RESPONSE; FERTILIZER; YIELD"	Increased fertilizer use is often an essential component of sustainable intensification for improved food security and economic growth in the upper elevation tropical savanna (UTS) and lower elevation tropical savanna (LTS) of Africa. The UTS and LTS are large breadbasket areas with little fertilizer use due to financial and other constraints. Farmers' perceptions of high profit opportunity with low risk are often major drivers of adoption. Representative crop nutrient response functions are needed to maximize farm-level profits from fertilizer use. Such functions were determined from results of past research, and profit potentials were evaluated. The mean yield increases due to fertilizer application at the economically optimum rate, relative to yield with no fertilizer applied, were as follows: 41% for cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), 18% for cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.], 16% for groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.), 67% for maize (Zea mays L.), 50% for lowland rice (Oryza sativa L.), and 39% for sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] in LTS, and 46% for bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), 81% for groundnut, 58% for maize, 96% for upland rice (Oryza sativa L. or Oryza glaberrima Steud.), 32% for sorghum, and 48% for soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] in UTS. The profit potential varied greatly across nutrient rates applied to individual crops making optimized crop-nutrient-rate choices especially important for cases of financially constrained fertilizer use. Considerations for achieving widespread adoption of increased fertilizer use are discussed. Increased fertilizer use needs to be complemented by mitigation of diverse yield and socioeconomic constraints to meet the growing demand for food.

Conservation agriculture effects on soil properties and crop productivity in a semiarid region of India	SOIL RESEARCH			English	Article						"aggregate stability; conservation tillage; cropping system; residue retention; semiarid environment; soil moisture; soil organic carbon; Vertisols"	"LONG-TERM TILLAGE; CLAY-LOAM SOIL; ORGANIC-CARBON; NO-TILLAGE; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; RESIDUE MANAGEMENT; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; STUBBLE RETENTION; CONVENTIONAL TILLAGE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES"	Conservation agriculture (CA) including reduced or no-tillage and crop residue retention, is known to be a self-sustainable system as well as an alternative to residue burning. The present study evaluated the effect of reduced tillage coupled with residue retention under different cropping systems on soil properties and crop yields in a Vertisol of a semiarid region of central India. Two tillage systems-conventional tillage (CT) with residue removed, and reduced tillage (RT) with residue retained-and six major cropping systems of this region were examined after 3 years of experimentation. Results demonstrated that soil moisture content, mean weight diameter, percent water stable aggregates (> 0.25 mm) for the 0-15 cm soil layer were significantly (P < 0.05) affected by tillage practices. Soil penetration resistance was significantly higher for RT than CT. Irrespective of soil depth, there was higher soil organic carbon (SOC) for RT than CT. The SOC fractions followed in the order: non-labile > moderately labile > less labile. At the 0-15 cm depth, the contributions of moderately labile, less labile and non-labile C fractions to total organic C were 39.3%, 10.3% and 50.4% respectively in RT and corresponding values for CT were 38.9%, 11.7% and 49.4%. Significant differences in different C fractions were observed between RT and CT. Soil microbial biomass C concentration was significantly higher in RT than CT at 0-15 cm depth. The maize-chickpea cropping system had significantly (P < 0.05) higher soybean grain equivalent yield of 4.65 t ha(-1) followed by soybean + pigeon pea (2 : 1) intercropping (3.50 t ha(-1)) and soybean-wheat cropping systems (2.97 t ha(-1)).

Assessment of nutrient competition and nutrient requirement in soybean/sorghum intercropping system	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"Nutrient competition; Intercropping; Legume; Vertisol"	"PEARL-MILLET; SEMIARID TROPICS; N-2 FIXATION; GRAIN-YIELD; GROWTH; NITROGEN; BARLEY; SORGHUM; OAT; PHOSPHORUS"	"Intercropping system of cereals with legume is common in semi-arid tropics of India. However, little attention has been paid to assessing nutrient competition in the system. Seasonal changes in relative city matter yield (RDY), relative nitrogen yield (RNY), relative phosphorus yield (RPY) and relative potassium yield (RKY) are useful indices to estimate the N, P and K status in intercropping system. The competitive effect of soybean (Glycine max L.) in association with sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) was assessed using these indices under six nutrient treatments (0, 75% NPK, 100% NPK, 75% NPK + 5 Mg farmyard manure, 75% NPK + 5 Mg phosphocompost and 75% NPK + 1.5 Mg Poultry manure) from a 5-year field experiment conducted in a N and P deficient Vertisol of Central India. The RDY and RNY of sorghum Were greater than the Values of RDY and RNY of soybean indicating inter-species competition for N between component crops, peak competition being at 80 days after sowing (DAS). Using the concept of RDY and RNY, it was observed that having coincided the maturity period and peak demand for N of both the crops, soil N was exhausted by sorghum because of its strong competitive ability and N was liming for soybean at 80 DAS. Strong competitive ability of sorghum was also evident from higher biomass, root mass, too( length density and contribution to the mixture yield. Once sorghum entered its maturity phase, its competitive effect on soybean was greatly reduced. Competition for P between two species is more e prominent up to 60 DAS and P was not limiting to none of the species after 60 DAS as the RPY values were equal to corresponding RDY values. Based oil RKY value, none of the component species Suffered from K deficiency at any stage even if it was not applied. This implied that competition exists for soil N and P but not for K Lip to 60-80 DAS in soybean/sorghum intercropping system. The result showed that competition between two crops measured in terms of RNY, RPY and RKY under organic-fertilizer was less; however. recorded higher soybean equivalent yield and monetary advantage index than inorganic-fertilizer. The study thus Suggests that in soybean/sorghum intercropping system to minimize competition between two crops it) N and P deficient Vertisol, application of 75% NPK + FYM/poultry manure/phosphocompost is a viable nutrient management option.

Intercropping systems were assessed on the basis of several existing intercropping indices such as land equivalent ratio (LER), relative crowding coefficient (RCC or K), aggressivity (A), competitive ratio (CR), actual yield loss (AYL), monetary advantage index (MAI), and intercropping advantage (IA). The LER and K values were greater for the common vetch-wheat (55:45) and the common vetch-oat (65:35) mixtures indicating that in these systems, there was an advantage of intercropping for exploiting the resources of the environment. A similar trend to that of LER and K was also observed for AYL. The aggressivity, CR and partial AYL values were greater for barley and oat than for wheat and triticale, whereas the corresponding values for common vetch were lower in mixtures with barley and oat than in mixtures with wheat and triticale. These findings indicate that barley and oat were more competitive partners than wheat and triticale as common vetch was affected more in mixtures with these two crops. The highest MAI and IA values were recorded for the common vetch-wheat (55:45) and the common vetch-oat (65:35) mixtures indicating that these intercropping systems were the most profitable.

Desmodium spp. are important intercrops in the 'push-pull'' strategy adopted for Striga and stemborer control in maize and sorghum. Production of desmodium seed is adversely affected by blister beetles, which feed on the flowers and negatively affect seed setting. To assess farmers' knowledge and perceptions of Hycleus spp. as pests, a questionnaire survey was conducted in three sites in Bungoma district, western Kenya, in 2007. The survey was followed by field sampling of Desmodium spp. and sweetpotato to compare the results with the responses received from farmers. Hycleus spp. were mentioned by 75% of the respondents as major pests of Desmodium spp. During field sampling Hycleus spp. comprised 70% of the insect pests collected. According to farmers, blister beetles were more abundant on desmodium than on sweetpotato. However, field sampling revealed that differences in beetle abundance on the two crops were not consistent across different sites, suggesting that these crops may function as alternative hosts. The study provides baseline information for the development of a management strategy for blister beetles.

The extent of the damage caused to crops is related to their close interaction with the parasite. The S. hermonthica seed germinates in response to germination stimulants exuded by cereal roots. The rootlet extremity then turns into a haustorium that attaches itself to the host root and penetrates its tissue. In this manner, a connection is established between the vascular systems of both plants, allowing absorption of water, minerals, and organic compounds that are essential for the parasite's development. S. hermonthica also affects the host's metabolism and photosynthesis. No effective control method against the parasite is available for the African peasants. The utilization of germination stimulants and herbicides, the rotation practice, and intercropping as well as biological control and varietal selection have given disappointing results so far. A better understanding of host resistance mechanisms is necessary to develop new methods for the control of the parasite.

J	"Bekunda, MA; Woomer, PL"				"Bekunda, MA; Woomer, PL"			Organic resource management in banana-based cropping systems of the Lake Victoria Basin, Uganda	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"banana-based cropping; organic resource management; soil fertility; intercropping; smallholder agriculture; Uganda"		The cultivation of plantain and cooking banana in humid areas of Uganda continues to grow in importance as rural population densities increase and as demand from urban areas intensifies. Difficulties accompany this importance, particularly soil depletion and intensification of pests and diseases of banana. We interviewed 510 farm families practising banana-based cultivation in six districts along the Lake Victoria Basin of southern-central Uganda to determine which resource management strategies are undertaken to mitigate limitations to banana cultivation and the importance of livestock and intercropping within those systems. Of the farmers interviewed, 97% reapply banana stalks and leaves to the banana mats on pruning and upon harvest, a practice that may contribute to banana weevil, stem nematode and sigatoka fungal attacks. Banana stalks were also applied as mulches to cash (4%) and field crops (2%) and used as livestock feed (10%). Farmers applied a wide range of additional resources to bananas including field crop residues (81%), burned residues (3%), on-farm manures (31%), compost (16%), external organic (17%) and chemical (4%) inputs. Of the organic inputs applied to bananas, bean trash (72%), maize stover (68%), cattle manure (45%) and composts (18%) were most frequently applied. It was necessary to consider at least five different organic inputs to account for more than 90% of farmer practices. Overall, intercropping was practised by 69% of the farmers. The six most encountered intercrops were, in decreasing order, beans, maize, cassava, Ficus nataliensis and fruit trees. When organic matter management was separated into five general categories depending on the reliance upon bananas, other crops, manures and composts as organic additions to soils, significant differences in reported average bunch weights were obtained. The farmers applying banana stalks, field crop residues and cattle manures reported the largest bunch weights (20.3 kg per bunch). Farmers relying upon banana stalks alone, banana stalks with field crop residues and either small livestock manure or domestic compost reported the lowest yields (13.1, 14.3 and 12.9 kg per bunch, respectively). We conclude that farmers are developing strategies to resist fertility depletion, in part through better recycling of on-farm resources and intercropping but greater reliance upon external inputs may be required to ameliorate declining banana yields.

The aim of the current study was to determine animal production and behavioural and ingestion parameters by evaluating the production and nutritive value of Aruana grass (Panicum maximum 'Aruana') intercropped with forage peanut (Arachis pintoi 'Amarillo') or fertilized with nitrogen. The treatments were N200 (200 kg N/ha per season - summer and winter), 100N + PE (100 kg N/ha per season plus pasture mixture with forage peanut) and N100 (100 kg N/ha per season). The presence of forage peanut in the pasture did not replace nitrogen fertilization as the pasture fertilized with 200 kg of nitrogen had a greater leaf/stem ratio (0.66 v. 0.54), stocking rate (2600 v. 2290 kg live weight/ha), average daily gain (0.880 v. 0.700 kg/day) and live weight gain (LWG) (652 v. 468 kg/ha) during summer. During winter, no effect of increased nitrogen fertilization on pasture and animal production was observed. In the total study period (summer + winter), a greater LWG (897 v. 741 kg/ha) occurred when a higher quantity of nitrogen (N200) was placed in the pasture compared to the insertion of forage peanuts in the system.

Practices of conservation agriculture, such as no-tillage and cover crops, are the key strategies of soil erosion control. In a long-term experiment on a Typic Paleudalf, we evaluated the temporal changes of soil loss and water runoff rates promoted by the transition from conventional to no-tillage systems in the treatments: bare soil (BS); grassland (GL); winter fallow (WF); intercrop maize and velvet bean (M+VB); intercrop maize and jack bean (M+JB); forage radish as winter cover crop (FR); and winter cover crop consortium ryegrass - common vetch (RG+CV). Intensive soil tillage induced higher soil losses and water runoff rates; these effects persisted for up to three years after the adoption of no-tillage. The planting of cover crops resulted in a faster decrease of soil and water loss rates in the first years after conversion from conventional to no-tillage than to winter fallow. The association of no-tillage with cover crops promoted progressive soil stabilization; after three years, soil losses were similar and water runoff was lower than from grassland soil. In the treatments of cropping systems with cover crops, soil losses were reduced by 99.7 and 66.7 %, compared to bare soil and winter fallow, while the water losses were reduced by 96.8 and 71.8 % in relation to the same treatments, respectively."

Model development	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"available soil water; crop model; intercropping; radiation interception; radiation use efficiency"	"RADIATION USE EFFICIENCY; GLOBAL SOLAR-RADIATION; WATER; CROP; NITROGEN; SORGHUM"	"Cereal-legume intercropping plays an important role in subsistence food production in developing countries, especially in situations of limited water resources. Crop simulation can be used to assess risk for intercrop productivity over time and space. In this study, a simple model for intercropping was developed for cereal and legume growth and yield, under semi-arid conditions. The model is based on radiation interception and use, and incorporates a water stress factor. Total dry matter and yield are functions of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), the fraction of radiation intercepted and radiation use efficiency (RUE). One of two PAR sub-models was used to estimate PAR from solar radiation; either PAR is 50% of solar radiation or the ratio of PAR to solar radiation (PAR/SR) is a function of the clearness index (K-T). The fraction of radiation intercepted was calculated either based on Beer's Law with crop extinction coefficients (K) from field experiments or from previous reports. RUE was calculated as a function of available soil water to a depth of 900 mm (ASW). Either the soil water balance method or the decay curve approach was used to determine ASW. Thus, two alternatives for each of three factors, i.e., PAR/SR, K and ASW, were considered, giving eight possible models (2 methods x 3 factors). The model calibration and validation were carried out with maize-bean intercropping systems using data collected in a semi-arid region (Bloemfontein, Free State, South Africa) during seven growing seasons (1996/1997-2002/2003). The combination of PAR estimated from the clearness index, a crop extinction coefficient from the field experiment and the decay curve model gave the most reasonable and acceptable result. The intercrop model developed in this study is simple, so this modelling approach can be employed to develop other cereal-legume intercrop models for semi-arid regions. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

A snapshot at diurnal trends	VITIS			English	Article						"cover crops; weeds; vineyard; evapotranspiration; sap flow; gas exchange"		The objective of this study was to quantify transpiration rates of two cover crops, Festuca rubra subsp. rubra (red fescue) and Medicago lupulina (black medick) and 4 weeds, Chenopodium album (fat hen), Cirsium arvense (creeping thistle), Malva neglecta (common mallow) and Taraxacum officinale (dandelion) occurring in a mixed stand in a commercial steep-slope, North-South oriented vineyard as compared to vines, cv. Riesling near Johannisberg (Rheingau), Germany. Leaf transpiration (E) was measured directly on the cover crop and weed species with a portable gas exchange measurement system. Grapevine transpiration was measured concomitantly using custom-made Granier-type xylem sap flow gauges. Measurements were conducted on two days in August (15(th) and 22(nd)) in 2001 under hot and sunny conditions. All herbaceous species presented a similar diurnal pattern of E, with low values in the morning and afternoon and peak values between 12 and 15 h. In contrast E of grapevines peaked mid-morning (between 8 and 10 h) remained relatively stable until mid-afternoon (16 h) before decreasing continuously until darkness. Significant differences in E between the herbaceous species were observed throughout the day. In general transpiration rates were highest for M. neglecta and lowest for C arvense, T officinale and E rubra subsp. rubra. We estimated the projected leaf area indices (leaf area per surface area covered) for each species and calculated possible transpiration rates for pure stands assuming that all leaves were well exposed. Potential transpiration rates ranged from about 1 mm d(-1) (one 1 m(-2) of soil surface) for E rubra subsp. rubra to = 5 mm d(-1) for M. neglecta as compared to only 0.9 mm d(-1) for grapevine. These results underline the importance of appropriate cover crop species and the control of some weed species with respect to water use.

However, changes in agricultural practices impact soil microbial communities, which in turn influence soil ecosystem ecology and functioning. Investigations about the effect of agricultural practices on microbial community structure and functional profile in tropical soils are limited to a few types of land use and soil management. In this study, we used a 9-year old field experiment with a kaolinitic Kandiudalfs located in Northeastern Brazil to assess the impact of six agricultural practices (three tillage methods combined with two cropping systems) and fallow plots dominated by Brachiaria sp. on soil phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA)-based microbial community structure and stress status, community-level physiological profile (CLPP), microbial biomass-C (MB-C), basal respiration and pH. The three tillage methods assessed were conventional tillage (CT; plowing + disking), chisel plowing (CP; no disking) and no-till (NT; no plowing nor disking), while the two cropping systems were monoculture (MM; sole maize) and intercropping (MP; maize with pigeonpea). Statistical analyses were performed to assess the differences in the following contrasts: agriculture (all agricultural practices) vs fallow; conventional tillage vs conservation tillage (CP + NT); chisel plowing vs no-till; and maize monoculture vs intercropping. Microbial community structure was more affected by the different agricultural practices and fallow than CLPP, but changes did not correspond to increasing in soil physical quality and crop system complexity. On the other hand, CLPP showed lower differences between fallow vs agricultural soils and was unaffected by tillage methods, but was changed according to cropping systems - properly reflecting the increases in crop system complexity. Fallow soils decreased amino acid degradation capability, microbial stress status, gram-positive bacteria and actinomycetes biomarkers, and increased arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and gram-negative bacteria biomarkers, MB-C and basal respiration. Conventional tillage unexpectedly led to increases in AMF and decreases in stress biomarkers compared to conservation tillage. Intercropping decreased soil pH and increased MB-C compared to monoculture. Our results showed that microbial community structure and physiological profile are distinct regarding their responses to the agricultural practices analyzed, as well as on their correlations with the soil and ecosystem benefits promoted by conservation practices. Therefore, taxonomic and functional approaches of microbial community profiling are potentially useful, but need to be combined with soil physicochemical data in order to help understanding the complex effects of using sustainable agriculture practices on the soil environment."

The individual simplex RTPCR methods used for the identification of multiple viruses are more tedious and time-consuming than the corresponding multiplex RT-PCR. This study used soybean mosaic virus (SMV), bean common mosaic virus (BCMV) and cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)-infected leaf samples from southern China as the test materials to evaluate a multiplex RT-PCR assay developed for the simultaneous detection of these viruses. The parameters optimised included the annealing temperature, extension time, number of cycles, and primer type and concentration. The specific fragments sizes obtained by the multiplex RT-PCR were 550 bp (SMV), 288 bp (BCMV) and 99 bp (CMV). The assay was tested using infected soybean samples obtained from farmers' fields in Sichuan Province, China. The multiplex RT-PCR assay had high sensitivity, was rapid and simple, and could be used for the diagnosis of soybean infected with various combinations of these viruses in the field.

The experiment was conducted at the research farm, College of Agriculture, Shahrekord, Iran during 2014 and 2015. Treatments included sole cropping of fenugreek (F), sole cropping of buckwheat (B), and three intercropping ratios. Second factor was N fertilizer type: mineral chemical fertilizer (CF) or broiler litter (BL). Intercropping improved yield of fenugreek and buckwheat compared with sole cropping and BL was the more effective fertilizer especially in intercrops. Fenugreek and buckwheat in intercrops used available environmental resources for increasing pods plant(-1), seeds pod(-1), 1000-seed weight, and harvest index (HI) (for fenugreek) and clusters plant(-1) and 1000-seed weight (for buckwheat) compared to the respective sole crops in both years. The resulting land equivalent ratios (LERs) of intercrops varied from 0.99 to 1.72 and the highest LER was observed in F:B=2:1 treated with BL. This study shows a potential yield benefit of fenugreek-buckwheat intercropping under semiarid growing conditions when planting fenugreek and buckwheat at a ratio of 2:1, respectively, and applying BL compared with sole cropping with inorganic fertilizer application.

In fact, our understanding of the interaction between the rhizosphere and bacterial communities in the intercropping system is still evolving; particularly, the influence of different sugarcane varieties on rhizosphere bacterial communities in the intercropping process with soybean, still needs further research. Here, we evaluated the response of sugarcane varieties ZZ1 and ZZ9 to the root bacterial community during intercropping with soybean. We found that when ZZ9 was intercropped with soybean, the bacterial diversity increased significantly as compared to that when ZZ1 was used. ZZ9 played a major role in changing the bacterial environment of the root system by affecting the diversity of rhizosphere bacteria, forming a rhizosphere environment more conducive to the growth of sugarcane. In addition, our study found that ZZ1 and ZZ9 had differed significantly in their utilization of nutrients. For example, nutrients were affected by different functional genes in processes such as denitrification, P-uptake and transport, inorganic P-solubilization, and organic P-mineralization. These results are significant in terms of providing guidance to the sugarcane industry, particularly for the intercropping of sugarcane and soybean in Guangxi, China."

Maturity selection but not sowing date enhances soybean productivity and land use in a winter camelina-soybean relay system	FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY			English	Article						"cover crop; cropping systems; land use productivity; oil; protein"	"COVER CROPS; SEED YIELD; FATTY-ACIDS; CORN; NITROGEN; WHEAT; INTENSIFICATION; PENNYCRESS; INTERCROPS; DIVERSIFICATION"	Enhancing crop diversification is needed to ensure sustainable food and energy production in the soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and maize (Zea mays L.) dominated cropping systems of the US Midwest. Relay-cropping soybean with winter camelina [camelina sativa (L.) Crantz] is a means to sustainably intensify food and energy production while adding cropping system diversity. However, soybean yields in relay systems tend to he less than a full-season monocrop. We hypothesized that improved soybean selection and seeding date for relay cropping could minimize this yield gap, thus increasing agricultural land use productivity. A 2-year field study was conducted to determine the effects of soybean maturity and seeding date (SD) on winter camelina and soybean yields and land use productivity. Three soybean genotypes differing in maturity (MG) were relayed into winter camelina at rosette (SD1), bolting (SD2), and first flowering (SD3) growth stages. The soybean MGs were MG0.2, MG1.1, and MG1.7 representing early, standard, and late maturity, respectively, for the study region. The MG1.1 sown at SD2 was grown as sole crop check using conventional practices (CP). Results demonstrated that SD3 decreased camelina seed yield compared with SD1 and SD2. Soybean yield in the relay system was greatest for the MG1.7 genotype, and averaged across SD1 and SD2, was just 11.6% less than the sole crop CP check. Relaying soybean MG1.7 at SD2 produced 43% greater total (camelina +soybean) oil yield and greatly improved land use efficiency compared with CP. Appropriate soybean genotype selection can enhance winter camelina-soybean relay system productivity and land use efficiency.

Millsp] + soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr] intercropping system. The experiment consisted of 6 tillage systems [CT1:No tillage with broad bed and furrow (BBF) and crop residue retained on the surface, CT2:Reduced tillage with BBF and incorporation of crop residue, CT3:No tillage with flatbed and crop residue retained on the surface, CT4:Reduced tillage with flatbed and incorporation of crop residue, CT5:Conventional tillage with incorporation of crop residue and CT6:Conventional tillage without crop residue. The experiment was laid out in strip block design and replicated thrice. The CA treatments significantly improved soil health. The pooled data revealed that, all the CA systems i.e. CT1, CT2, CT3 and CT4 recorded significantly higher soil organic carbon at 0-15 cm depth (0.62, 0.64, 0.60 a d 0.62%, respectively) and 15-30 cm depth (0.56, 0.56, 0.54 and 0.55%, respectively), higher soil carbon sequestration (15.1, 15.4, 14.6 and 14.7 tonnes/ha, respectively) over conventional till systems. However, soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen were significantly higher in all the CA systems. While, significantly higher soil urease activity (11.76, 11.86, 11.10 and 11.44 mu g NH4-N/g/day), dehydrogenase activity (32.29, 32.29, 31.14 and 31.55 mu g TPF/g/day) and total phosphatase activity (173.21, 174.55, 170.09 and 173.21 mu g PNP/g/hr) were recorded in CT1, CT2, CT3 and CT4 over CT5 and CT6.

Crops in System 1 were: oat-vetch, wheat-trifolium, teff straw, and cowpea, and in System 2 maize-lablab replaced wheat-trifolium, The presence of legumes in crop mixtures improved forage quality. System x feeding level interaction effect was included in the analytical model, Mean (+/-SE) daily milk yield was higher (P < 0.01) in System 2 (4.02 +/- 0.13 kg) than in System 1 (3.12 +/- 0.13 kg) and higher in cows fed ad libitum (3.94 +/- 0.13 kg, P < 0.01) than in cows on the restricted regime (3.21 +/- 0.13). Milk composition was not influenced by treatments. Cows on Level 1 lost more (P < 0.05) live weight than those on Level 2 (4.8 vs 1.8%) from mobilization of body reserves to support the increasing milk production, Conception rate was similar between systems but higher (P < 0.05) for cows on Level 1 than Level 2, Supplementary feeding strategies for the type and level of feeding used, have to be developed in order to improve milk production and reproductive efficiency.

Adapting to High Temperatures: Effect of Farm Practices and Their Adoption Duration on Total Value of Crop Production in UgandaJEL codes	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						"Adaptation; climate change; sustainable agriculture; Uganda; vulnerability; Q12; Q18; Q54; Q55"	"SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; SOIL FERTILITY MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; SMALLHOLDER FARMERS; MAIZE PRODUCTION; SOCIAL NETWORKS"	In this article, we use spatially granular climate data merged with four waves of household survey data in Uganda to examine empirically the relationships among high temperatures, total value of crop production, and the adoption and adoption duration of two sustainable agricultural practices (organic fertilizer adoption and maize-legume intercropping). We do this using a fixed-effect model with instrumental variables to address potential endogeneity issues. Our findings indicate that the adoption of these practices has a positive effect on the total value of crop production, and such effect increases monotonically as temperatures increase from long-term averages. Moreover, the number of years a farmer uses the practice is associated with higher total value of crop production, and this relationship holds across the full distribution of high temperature deviations. Taken together, the results suggest that promoting the adoption, and particularly the sustained adoption, of these practices can help to address the risks posed by rising temperatures to Ugandan agriculture and the livelihoods of farmers who depend on it.

This study conducted at two sites in Quebec, eastern Canada, identified the most appropriate preceding legume crops for subsequent corn (Zea mays L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield and N nutrition. Legumes were established in 2011, in monoculture or mixed with grain crops, for a total of 13 treatments: common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), soybean (Glycine max L.), dry pea (Pisum sativum L.), hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), and crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.), hairy vetch/wheat, crimson clover/wheat, field pea/wheat, alfalfa/corn, hairy vetch/corn, crimson clover/corn) and a non-N fixing crop (corn) as the control. In 2012, each plot was split and five N fertilizer rates applied to corn and wheat. Four legume systems (alfalfa, hairy vetch, crimson clover, and hairy vetch/wheat) significantly increased the soil structure stability, alkaline phosphatase and dehydrogenase activities at warmer St-Mathieu-de-Beloeil location but not at the cooler St-Lambert-de-Lauzon site. These legumes also significantly increased yields and N nutrition of corn and wheat at St-Mathieu-de-Beloeil and of wheat only at St-Lambert-de-Lauzon. Although legume N credit was found low (similar to 30 kg N ha(-1)), the N fertilizer replacement value was 51 to 77 kg N ha(-1) for corn and up to 37 kg N ha(-1) for wheat, depending on the preceding legume crop. Th is suggests that indirect effects related to improved soil properties impacted positively corn and wheat yield and N nutrition.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the agronomic traits of two corn cultivars grow in the second-crop harvest in different environments, production systems, and N application rates in an Oxisol in the Cerrado region of Mato Grosso do Sul. The experimental design was a randomized block arranged in a split-split plot with three replicates. Plots consisted of two environments (UFMS 1 and UFMS 2), subplots consisted of two production systems [corn alone (monoculture) or corn intercropped with U. ruziziensis, and sub-subplots of five N application rates in topdressing (0, 40, 80, 120, or 160 kg N/ha). Urea was used as the source of N (45% N), and it was applied 30 days after emergence (DAE). Two corn cultivars (NS50 and Invictus Viptera 3) were used. During the flowering period of corn (i.e., after the emergence of female inflorescence), the relative chlorophyll index, leaf N concentration, plant height, and ear insertion height were recorded. At physiological maturity, the ear insertion height, ear length, number of grain rows per ear, number of grains per row, ear diameter, mass of one thousand grains, and grain yield were measured. The corn grain yield is lower in the system intercropped with U. ruziziensis when compared to the cultivation of corn alone (monoculture). In addition, the environment with greater soil base saturation and N availability (UFMS 2) results in a distinct response for the corn cultivar used; thus, a greater grain yield is expected from cultivar Viptera 3 in this environment. The maximum agronomic efficiency for corn grain yield is obtained with 102 to 123 kg N/ha for the Viptera 3 and NS50 PRO cultivars, respectively."

However, intercropping of lupine with tef is a new practice in Northwestern Ethiopia's tef-based cropping system. In the 2016 and 2017 main cropping seasons, a field experiment was conducted in Gozamin District, East Gojjam Zone, to assess the effect of plant density of lupine intercropping with tef on the productivity of tef fields. The two experimental factors were two inter-row spacings (20 and 40 cm) and three intra-row spacings (10, 15, and 20 cm) of lupine intercropped with tef, and their factorial combination was studied using a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. The highest tef grain yield (1.80 t ha(-1)) was recorded from 40 and 20 cm inter- and intra-row spacing of lupine intercropped with tef, respectively. The highest lupine yield (2.74 t ha(-1)) was recorded from sole cropping. A total of 40 and 15 cm inter- and intra-row spacing of lupine intercropped with tef improved tef equivalent yield (2.32 t ha(-1)), area time equivalent ratio (1.09), actual yield loss (0.87), monetary advantage index (396.2 USD), net benefit (2479.5 USD ha(-1)), and marginal rate of return (MRR) (682%). Among all planting densities, 40 and 15 cm inter- and intra-row spacing of lupine were the most profitable and had the highest yield advantage based on equivalent yield and other economic benefits.

A two-year field study was conducted in Central Italy to determine how N fertilization rate affected forage and grain production as well as intercropping efficiency in a barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and field bean (Vicia faba L. var minor) intercrop. Crops were grown as monocrops or intercropped in alternate rows in an additive design and fertilized with five N rates from 0 to 200 kg ha(-1). Forage production was determined both at heading and early dough, while grain yield was assessed at full ripening. Besides, land equivalent ratio, competitive ratio, and aggressivity index were calculated. Consistently between years, results highlighted that intercropping of barley with field bean can be a sustainable cropping system because both forage production and efficiency indices improved. Anyway, with 150 and 200 kg N ha(-1), the grain yield was lower in intercropping than in sole crops, due to higher interspecific competition. We concluded that the optimal N fertilization depends on the farmer's objective in terms of forage or grain production and the targeted proportion between the cereal and the legume at harvest.

The developed intercrop planter facilitates to sow chickpea in the same harvested field of soybean in the presence of standing crop of pigeon pea. The developed intercrop planter was capable to sow 5 rows of soybean in the broad bed of 1.5 m width, make ridges in both the sides of the broad bed and sow one row of pigeon pea in both the outer sides of the ridge simultaneously. The machine consists of mainframe, inverted T-type furrow openers, ridger, ground wheel, power transmission system, inclined plate metering mechanism for seed and fluted roller metering mechanism for fertilizer and delivery tubes. Two separate detachable planters for the sowing of pigeon pea were attached to both ends of the main frame. The width of the intercrop planter was 4.2 m. The experiment was laid out in a split plot design. The plant to plant spacing was maintained by the intercrop planter for soybean, pigeon pea and chickpea was 5 cm, 30 cm, 10 cm respectively. The speed of operation, actual field capacity, field efficiency and fuel consumption for intercropping of soybean -pigeon pea was 2.46 km/h, 0.56 ha/ h, 77.2% and 4.7 l/h respectively. In intercropping seed yield of pigeon pea was found maximum for row spacing of 120 cm for pigeon pea. The maximum yield was found 10.7 q/ha, 13.6 q/ha and 8.2 q/ha for soybean, pigeon pea and chickpea respectively. The land equivalent ratio of pigeon pea was found 1.56 with soybean and 1.38 with chickpea. The per hectare cost of operation of intercropping was Rs. 1126.8.

A randomized complete block design with four replications was used. Intercropping patterns included 80% barley+ 20% vetch, 60% barley+ 40% vetch, 40% barley + 60% vetch and 20% barley + 80% vetch along with the sole culture of both crops (100% barley and 100% vetch). The result showed that the highest value of plant height, grain number, thousand-grain weight, biological yield, grain yield and harvest in barley was observed from 80% barley + 20% vetch intercropping ratio, however, for vetch, it was detected from 100% vetch. Furthermore, the highest land equivalent ratio was obtained from 80% barley+ 20% vetch. Based on the results, the highest crude protein content and dry matter digestibility were observed in sole cropped vetch, whereas the highest neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber were recorded in sole cropped barley. These results suggested that intercropped barley and vetch as 80% barley + 20% vetch ameliorated the grain yield and yield components, and forage quality compared to other intercropping ratios.

Oat genotypic requirement for intercropping with vetch under Mediterranean conditions	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						"Common vetch; intercrop; Mediterranean environments; Oat"	"COMMON VETCH; FORAGE YIELD; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; COVER CROPS; DRY-MATTER; WHEAT; QUALITY; BARLEY; NITROGEN; SYSTEM"	Oat (Avena spp. L.) intercropped with common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) has shown high forage yield and crude protein content (CP) in rainfed Mediterranean environments of Greece. The objective was to study the oat genotypic interactions for yield, quality and agronomic traits of four oat accessions (cv. Flega and lines B2, B3 and B4) grown as intercrops with a common vetch cultivar (Pegasus) and as monocrops without or with nitrogen (N) supplementation (100 kg N/ha). In all mixtures, the land equivalent ratio exceeded the unit indicating that there was a yield advantage. Intercrops produced, on average, 5.0% less dry matter (DM) and 38.9% more crude protein yield (CPY) compared to monocropped oats with N fertilization and 3.4% more DM and 75.5% more CPY compared to monocropped oats without N fertilization. The DM, CP and quality differences between the intercropped and monocropped oats were attributed to oats by vetch cultivar interactions. The oat B2 intercropped was the shortest, the latest flowering and the less vigorous early in the season, a trait that allowed common vetch to dominate in the intercrop (vetch participation 770 g/kg). The high vetch fragment in the intercrop contributed to high CP, CPY, acid detergent lignin, total digestible nutrients, relative feeding value, relative forage quality, net energy for lactation and to low neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre and hemicellulose. The replacement value index indicated that the intercrop was 21% more economically viable in comparison to the fertilized monocrop.

This research was carried out to find growth stages during which mixture of oat (Avena sativa L.) and triticale (x Triticosecale Wittm.) was resistant to harrowing and was able to effectively recover from this physical disturbance. Plots were harrowed 1-3 times on the same day at six consecutive stages of mixture growth with spring-tine harrow. After the latest harrowing, all plots were sprayed with herbicide to exclude competitive effect of weeds on the mixture. Compared to non-harrowed plots plant density of mixture was significantly reduced after a single cultivation at 1- and 2-leaf stage (20% and 23% respectively), two cultivations at 3-leaf stage (22%) and three at the beginning of the tillering (21%). No yield penalty was noticed for the density reductions, thus showing high ability of mixture to recover from physical disturbance. We recommend plant emergence as an appropriate growth stage for single harrowing of oat-triticale mixture. Two cultivations on the same day should not be planned earlier than at the beginning of tillering.

This interaction can alleviate population competition, improve resource utilization in populations, and promote population harmony and community stability. However, cultivated plant populations may have insufficient time to establish a positive interaction, thereby hindering the formation of the positive interaction. As current studies have not fully addressed these issues, our study established soybean/wheat intercropping populations beneficial for growth and explored the effects of nutrient level and planting density on the positive interaction between the two crops. Changes across population modules in both sole cropping and intercropping populations of soybean and wheat were analyzed. Results using nutrient levels of 1/2- or 1/4 -strength Hoagland solution indicated that soybean/ wheat intercropping population modules significantly increased at low planting densities (D20 and D26) and significantly decreased at high planting densities (D-32 and D-60). Therefore, as planting density increased, the modules of both intercropping populations initially increased before decreasing. Similarly, positive interaction initially strengthened before weakening. Moreover, at an intermediate planting density, the population modules reached their maxima, and the positive interaction was the strongest. Under the same planting density, 1/4 -strength Hoagland solution recorded better growth for the soybean/wheat intercropping population modules compared to results using the 1/2 -strength Hoagland solution. These findings indicated that low nutrient level can increase the positive interaction of intercropping populations at a given planting density, and that environmental nutrient level and population planting densities constrain the positive interaction between soybean and wheat populations in the intercropping system. This study highlights issues that need to be addressed when constructing intercropping populations.

A field experiment was conducted during two growing seasons (2014-2015 and 2015-2016) with the objective of determining optimum Cu rates and critical Cu levels in soybean-wheat intercropping in a NT management. We used a randomized block design consisting of five Cu rates (0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 kg ha(-1)) applied before the first soybean crop. Both soybean and wheat showed a significant yield response to Cu, and the estimated value for maximum yield (EVMY) was 4.4 and 4.2 kg ha(-1) Cu application for soybean and wheat, respectively. Wheat required available Cu levels of 15.5 (DTPA-TEA extractant) and 20.5 mg kg(-1) (Mehlich 1 extractant) in the soil for maximum yield, whereas for soybean maximum yields were obtained with 7.7 and 14.1 mg kg(-1), respectively, for the two extractants. For soybean, number of pods per plant (NPP) and Fe concentration in the grain were influenced by Cu rate, whereas in wheat Cu rate only affected plant height. Cu rates also had a positive effect on photosynthetic rate (A), intercellular CO2 level, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, and chlorophyll content of soybean, and A and chlorophyll content in wheat. The results suggest the need to increase the amount of Cu applied to the soil in soybean-wheat intercropping in a NT management.

Compared with C. oleifera monoculture, the soil porosity in intercropping C. oleifera with peanut was increased by 11.45 and 8.41%, the electrical conductivity by 14.74 and 16.90%, the rhizosphere fungi populations by 21.46 and 15.38%, the rhizosphere bacterial populations by 52.19 and 43.87%, soil organic matter (SOM) by 4.72 and 5.69%, the available nitrogen (N) by 10.71 and 14.51%, available calcium (Ca) by 10.53 and 17.39% and available magnesium (Mg) by 18.18 and 20.00% in 2012 and 2013, respectively. However, intercropping significantly reduced soil bulk density, soil total and exchangeable phosphorus (P), soil total and exchangeable potassium (K) and exchangeable aluminum (Al) in both years. Therefore, the beneficial effect may be attributed to the improvement of bulk density, soil nutrient element and the reduction in pH, as well as the rhizosphere microbial populations in intercropping systems.

The experiment was conducted in 2009-2011 on a Haplic Phaeozem soil in the western part of Poland. Intercropping of pea significantly reduced the green area index and the normalized difference vegetation index values, but growing pea with linseed caused a significant increase in the number of nodes with pods, pods per stem, and seeds per stem. Intercropping with wheat increased the seed number per pod. Seed inoculation with Nitragina significantly increased the number of pea pods and seeds per stem. Wheat intercropped with pea, with inoculation and foliar fertilization, attained significantly lower straw weight and spike length. Intercropping of linseed significantly reduced the features of the yield structure. Bacterial inoculation increased the production potential of pea at the expense of the supporting plants.

This hypothesis was tested in the Henan Province of China in 2016 where aphids, their natural enemies and mummies were trapped and observed on crops in three treatments: wheat-pea strip intercropping solely (control), intercropping combined with the release of E--farnesene (EBF) and intercropping combined with the release of methyl salicylate (MeSA). Each treatment was repeated four times. The abundance of aphids throughout the growing season (9 weeks between March and May) was significantly decreased and the abundance of natural enemies and mummies were significantly increased in treatments with releases of semiochemicals compared to intercropping solely. The effect was stronger with MeSA than with EBF on the control of Rhopalosiphum padi and pea aphids as well as on the attraction of lacewings and hoverflies. Indeed, lacewings and hoverflies were on average twice more numerous in MeSA than in the other treatments. These results show that combining wheat-pea intercropping with the release of EBF or MeSA can significantly reduce aphid density and attract their natural enemies and that this effect is strengthen with MeSA when compared to EBF.

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						"sole-cropping; intercropping; productivity; inter-specific competition; wheat; rapeseed"	"YIELD RESPONSE; SOWING DATE; CANOLA; PEA; COMPETITION; NITROGEN; BARLEY; REPLACEMENT; INDEXES; EFFICIENCY"	Recent advances in agronomy include better understanding of biodiversity in the ecosystem and mechanisms of interactions between crop species. Intercropping encompasses two or more crop species growing together. Enhanced biodiversity in intercropping systems can increase productivity, stability, resilience, and resource-use efficiency of the intercropped species compared with sole-cropping. Feasibility of different wheatrapeseed intercropping patterns were evaluated under three nitrogen fertilizer rates (0, 60, and 120 kg N ha(-1)) across two experimental years. Besides sole-cropping of wheat (1:0) and rapeseed (0:1), three patterns of wheat-rapeseed intercropping were arranged in different ratios, including 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3. Rapeseed growth and development were influenced highly by inter-annual weather variability, which resulted in a low yield in the second year of the experiment. Total cropping system performance, as indicated by dry matter (per plant and per unit area) and grain yield production, increased with adding N fertilizer, especially in the drier year. Additional N fertilizer could only compensate the yield loss due to intercropping in that year. In terms of individual crop production, sole-cropping of wheat was superior to all intercrops under the environmental conditions of the Pannonian region. Overall, among wheat-rapeseed intercropping patterns, the ratio of 3:1 had advantages over the other intercropping patterns in terms of productivity and interspecies competition across contrasting years.

Therefore, to maximize land use and production, the ultimate goal of agriculture, namely yield, intercropping is an advanced agronomic technique that allows two or more crops to yield from the same area of land. Better utilization of resources and reduced weed competition minimize the risk of food shortages by enhancing yield stability. Several factors can affect intercropping: plant density, sowing time, the maturity of a crop, the selection of crop that is compatible with another as well as farmers' and the region's socioeconomic conditions. In intercropping, the land equivalent ratio (LER) is used to measure the productivity of land. Since wheat is the most important cereal around the world and is most suitable for intercropping, this review focuses on wheat-based intercropping.

In this scenario, the cropping systems which can meet the increasing demand of food, feed and forage are needed. Intercropping is an eco-friendly option for sustaining and increasing the productivity of farmlands as it control weeds, improve soil health and increase the net returns per unit area. In this two-year study, we compared the relative performance and profitability of barley-based intercropping systems. Winter crops viz. chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), lentil (Lens culinaris Medik), egyptian clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.), linseed (Linum usitatissimum L.), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill), garden cress (Lepidium sativum L.) and garlic (Allium sativum L.) were intercropped with barely (Hordeum vulgare L.). All the intercrops decreased the grain yield of barley over sole cropping. In this regard, minimum reduction in grain yield of barely was observed when it was intercropped with lentil (8.74%), while maximum reduction (17.85%) was recorded when barley was intercropped with fennel. However, barley appeared to be dominant crop as was indicated by its higher values of relative crowding coefficient, competitive ratio and positive sign of aggressivity. All intercrops gave more economic returns than sole cropping of barley; however, on the basis of land equivalent ratio, maximum yield advantage was recorded in barley + lentil intercropping system, while on the basis of net profits, maximum net economic return was recorded in barley + garlic intercropping. These results suggested that farmers in central Punjab Pakistan, may adopt barley + garlic intercropping system.

Cereal-legume intercropping could be a viable option to obtain forage with higher protein content. A two-year experiment was conducted during 2009 and 2010 growing seasons in a loamy soil to determine whether intercropping pattern of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and annual medic (Medicago scutellata L.) could increase forage quality while producing sufficient amount of forage yield. The results showed that when number of rows in 50:50 replacement intercropping decreased from six rows of barley and six rows of medic (6B:6M) (strip intercropping) to 4B:4M, 2B:2M and 1B:1M, barley forage yield increased by 9, 18 and 24% due to a wavy canopy created by 1B:1M and 2B:2M cropping ratios. Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) was highest (1.19) when barley was intercropped with annual medic in 1B:1M arrangement indicating that 19% more area would be required by a sole cropping system to yield similar of intercropping system. The highest protein yield was also obtained from 1B:1M ratio. Pure stand of annual medic had the highest Crude Protein (CP) content (310.7 g kg(-1) of DM) whereas sole cropping of barley had the highest Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF) and Acid Detergent Fiber (ADF). When both forage yield and quality was considered, the intercropping of barley and medic with 1B:1M ratio was superior to any other ratios and can be recommended to farmers as an alternative to barley alone.

To cope with and then find out remedies for many problems, field study entitled weed control effects on the wheat-pea intercropping was conducted at Research Farm, The University of Agriculture, Peshawar, Pakistan during Rabi season 2010. Randomized complete block (RCB) design was used with split plot arrangements. There were two main plots each having eight treatments. One main plot was kept weed free while the second was kept weed infested throughout the crop season. The details of wheat and pea combinations (treatments) was; (1) sole wheat (8 rows), (2) sole pea (8 rows), (3) wheat (1 row) + pea (1 row), (4) wheat (2 rows) + pea (1 row), (5) wheat (3 rows) + pea (1 row), (6) wheat (2 rows) + pea (2 rows), (7) wheat (3 rows) + pea (2 rows) and (8) wheat (3 rows) + pea (3 rows). Statistical analysis of the data revealed that weeding significantly decreased the weed density at 120 days after sowing (DAS), fresh and dry weed biomass. Weeds related parameters like weed density, fresh and dry weed biomass was significantly decreased by intercropping of peas in wheat. Weeds removal significantly increased spike length and grain yield of wheat. Weeds removal as well as intercropping of wheat and pea significantly affected the green pods yield of pea where maximum pods were recorded under weed free conditions. Sole pea produced higher yield of pods as compared to intercropped plots. Therefore in light of the instant studies it could be concluded that pea should be intercropped in wheat.

The instability of the CWPS has increased particularly during the post-transgenic hybrids phase mainly because of these hybrids calling for intensive crop management being cultivated under all situations, especially in resource-poor conditions leading to violent fluctuations during adverse years and thereby affecting the socio-economic status of these developing countries. A study was conducted to evaluate and quantify the effect of the two-tier intercropping of cotton and peanut with the substitution of a 25-50% recommended dose of nitrogen (RDN) of cotton by farmyard manure (FYM) on productivity, profitability and nitrogen economy in the CWPS at New Delhi during 2006-08. To quantify the residual effects of previous crops and their fertility levels, a succeeding crop of wheat was grown with varying rates of nitrogen, viz. 0, 50, 100 and 150 kg ha(-1). Wheat equivalent productivity was significantly more with the inclusion of peanut in the CWPS (21-26%) with a high net return (US$288) than a pure stand of cotton in the CWPS. The substitution of 25% RDN of cotton by FYM being on par with no substitution recorded a higher wheat equivalent yield, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium uptake, net return and nitrogen use efficiencies. Nitrogen economy in wheat was 22 kg ha(-1) due to inclusion of peanut in the CWPS and 13 kg ha(-1) due to substitution of the 25% RDN of cotton by FYM. The study suggested that for the success of the CWPS in South Asian countries, escalating prices of N fertilizers with environmental issues and the instability of transgenic hybrids can be overcome by using wider rows of cotton by peanut intercrop with the integrated use of both organic and inorganic sources of nitrogen.

Harvest Aid Application Timing Affects Wheat and Relay Intercropped Soybean Yield	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							"SYSTEMS; SOIL; GROWTH; RUNOFF; IMPACT"	Early-seeded soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] relay intercropped into standing wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) using soybean seed-coat technology may allow profitable wheat production in the Midwest on highly erodible soils. Dry conditions in mid-to late June have reduced relay intercropped soybean stands and yield in some years. We hypothesized that using glyphosate as a wheat harvest aid would reduce the impact of wheat interference on relay intercropped soybean grain yield and increase gross margins. Field research conducted over four site-years in upstate Missouri evaluated timings for application of glyphosate as a harvest aid on wheat and relay intercropped soybean. The cost effectiveness of these cropping systems was compared to full-season soybean, double-cropped wheat-soybean, and wheat-only production systems. Glyphosate applied to wheat 1 wk before harvest, aft er late dough, in a relay intercrop production system with coated-soybean maintained wheat grain yields similar to nontreated wheat, and increased soybean grain yields 290 to 770 kg ha(-1) compared to nontreated wheat relay intercropped or double-cropped with soybean. Earlier glyphosate application timings (2-3 wk before wheat harvest) reduced wheat grain yields 10 to 25% and grain density 3 to 13%, but soybean yield increased 430 to 520 kg ha(-1) compared to nontreated wheat in a relay intercrop system. A relay intercrop system with seed coat technology and glyphosate as a harvest aid may allow farmers to maintain wheat in their crop rotation while minimizing risk associated with early fall frost or dry conditions at seeding that may otherwise decrease double-crop soybean yields.

Air and soil temperatures, humidity, wind, and photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) for each row in a strip were recorded continuously during 4-13-day periods several times during each growing season; short-term measurements of light extinction through the corn and soybean canopies were made late in the 1993 growing season. Soybean biomass in September 1993 was also determined. Early in the growing season, there typically were no significant differences among rows within a strip in any environmental or growth variable. Later in the growing season, daily PPFD received varied more across each strip than any other environmental variable measured; the outer side of edge rows of corn in north-south rows typically received significantly higher daily PPFD (2-38% more) than inner rows in the strip, while the outside of the soybean row furthest from corn received 36-140% greater PPFD than the corn-side of the row next to the corn strip. Soybean height; leaf mass per leaf area; and leaf mass, stem mass, and pod mass per unit land area in September were strongly related to daily PPFD, with all except height increasing with greater PPFD. Total biomass increased by 32% from the row closest to corn to the row furthest from corn, although there was no change in the ratio of leaf:stem:pod with row position. Thus, PPFD varied the most across the strips of any environmental variable, and crop growth was closely related to PPFD received. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Forage yield and quality of cereal-berseem clover intercrops may differ among oat (Avena sativa L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivars and with semidwarf or early maturing cereal cultivars. Berseem clover was intercropped with five oat and four barley cultivars at Edmonton, Alberta, in 2000 and 2001 on orthic black chernozem (Typic Cryoboroll) soil. Forage yield, composition, and quality were measured with a two-cut harvest. Silage-stage yield (Cut 1) averaged 9.9 Mg ha(-1) of dry matter (DM) with 18% berseem clover by dry weight. Berseem clover regrowth (Cut 2) averaged 2.8 Mg ha(-1) DM with crude protein (CP) of 215 g kg(-1). Intercrops with oat cultivars had greater Cut 1 DM yield, and intercrops with barley had greater yields of Cut 2 DM and total CP. The earlier maturity of barley provided for longer periods of berseem clover regrowth. Intercrops with semidwarf barley had equal yields of total DM and CP and greater Cut 2 DM yield than those with conventional-stature barley. Intercrops with early maturing oat cultivars had equal total DM yield and greater yields of Cut 2 DM and total CP than those with late-maturing oat cultivars. Forage quality indicators suggested that intercrops with barley were superior to those with oat. To maximize fall forage and increase the legume component of silage harvest, early maturing and shorter-stature cultivars of oat and barley are recommended for cereal-berseem clover intercrops.

The intercrop was composed using half of the seeding densities from pure stands. Intercropping increased protein content in grain and plant biomass of triticale irrespective of N input. Increasing N rate from 0 to 25 kg/ha increased plant biomass yield of triticale and intercrop. Nitrogen uptake with grain and biomass of intercrop was significantly higher than by sole crops showing partial complementarity in N use by intercropped species despite strong dominance of triticale over field beans. The higher the N fertilizer rate, the lower was the gain from intercropping mainly due to increased suppression of field beans by triticale. Agronomic efficiency was similar for triticale and intercrop but it was significantly smaller for field beans indicating there were other limited resources hampering growth of the legume.

To be able to improve the management of intercrops, a more detailed knowledge is required on aspects of interference between crops. A bioassay and a pot experiment were conducted to assess both the mechanisms and the time of expression of processes involved in the early interference between pea (Pisum sativum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) when grown as intercrops. Conditions of non-limiting nutrient and water supply were chosen to eliminate competition for these growth factors. The bioassay gave no indication of either competitive or allelopathic interactions, as none of the crops were growth depressed when intercropped compared with when grown as sole crops. The effect of barley interference, as a depression in pea dry matter production in the IC, was observed in the pot experiment as early as 2 weeks after emergence. Although competition was supposedly eliminated, there were indications of strong above-ground competition among sole cropped barley plants as well as among pea and oilseed rape plants intercropped with barley. Growth characteristics that allow for rapid establishment of barley plants are likely to be the determining factors leading to the dominance exerted by this species when intercropped.

J	"Duncan, SR; Schapaugh, WT"				"Duncan, SR; Schapaugh, WT"			Relay-intercropped soybean in different water regimes, planting patterns, and winter wheat cultivars	JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE			English	Article								Relay-intercropping soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] into winter wheat [Triticum aestivum L.) at the boot stage may be a profitable production alternative in environments where doublecropped soybean production after wheat harvest is unreliable. However, moisture availability, planting pattern, and growth characteristics of different wheat cultivars may influence soybean survival and final yield. To better define the conditions under which relay-intercropping would be acceptable to growers, we compared the influences of water regimes, planting patterns, and wheat cultivars on soybean growth and yield. In 1988 and 1989, five wheat cultivars were planted in solid and skip-row patterns near Manhattan and Rossville, KS, and 'Resnik' soybean was intercropped in wheat at the late boot stage. All plots received equal irrigation prior to wheat harvest and different amounts (limited vs. full) during the remaining growing season. Soybean yields at Rossville were not affected by irrigation regime, but at Manhattan, fully irrigated soybean yields were 27% greater than soybean under limited irrigation. The intercrop competition period averaged 16 d longer in 1989 than in 1990. Wheat was planted in 8 in. rows in a solid and one-out-of-three skip-row pattern. Soybean in all planting patterns was in 24 in. rows - between the 8 in. wheat rows, in the middle of the 16 in. skip, or in a conventionally tilled, sole cropped (SC) planting. When intercropped in solid wheat stands (SI), soybean yielded 52 and 37% of soybean in skip-row intercropped (SRI) and SC patterns, respectively, in 1989, and 80 and 64% of SRI and SC yields, respectively, in 1990. Solid intercropped soybean received 36 and 64% of the total measured photosynthetically active radiation that reached SC and SRI soybean canopies, respectively. Seventy six percent of unharvested soybean plots (reduced or eliminated populations) were SI. Soybean intercropped into short wheat cultivars had higher (14 to 20%) yields than soybean in taller wheat cultivars. Wheat cultivar maturity had no consistent effect on intercropped soybean yield. Of the soybean plots abandoned because of reduced populations, 76% were intercropped into tall or medium-late maturing wheat cultivars. If relay intercropping soybean into winter wheat is to be implemented on soils that are droughty or have low moisture-holding capacity, supplemental irrigation must be available. Using an SRI planting pattern with wheat cultivars of shorter stature will increase chances for soybean survival and profitable yields.

The N and F contents of grain and straw as well as their uptake. and status of available N and P in the soil were also significantly higher with this system. Wheat yield increased by 18% due to the residual effect of intercropping at 1 : 3 ratio compared with sole pigeonipea. and its N requirement decreased by 60 kg N/ha. Phosphorus Fertilization to intercropping system at 38 kg P/ha significantly improved the grain (32%) and stalk yields of both pigeonpea and soybean crops, and the uptake and availability of N and P in the soil. It had significant residual effect oil wheat, by giving 20.6% more yield than the control and reducing the N requirement by 30 kg N/ha besides improving the N and P status in the soil.

J	"Iragavarapu, TK; Randall, GW"				"Iragavarapu, TK; Randall, GW"			Border effects on yields in a strip-intercropped soybean, corn, and wheat production system	JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE			English	Article								Strip-intercropping of corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] normally results in corn producing a negative border effect on soybean production. This study was conducted to determine whether including a small grain strip between corn and soybean strips could reduce the negative border effects of corn and enhance soybean yields. Corn, soybean, and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were grown as strip intercrops (15-ft wide) in a ridge-till system at two locations in southern Minnesota from 1991 through 1994 and were compared with a two-crop corn-soybean system. Rows were oriented east-west at one location and north-south at the other. Soybean yield in the three-crop system was reduced by 17% for the north row adjacent to corn and 8% for the south row next to wheat compared with nonborder east-west rows. In north-south rows, soybean yields were reduced by 21% in the east row next to corn compared with nonborder rows with no yield reduction in the west row next to wheat. In the two-crop corn-soybean strip system, soybean yields were reduced by 34 and 11% in the south and north border rows, respectively, compared with the nonborder rows in east-west rows. In north-south rows, the outside east row yielded 19% less and the west row yielded 21% less than the nonborder rows. Corn yield of the outside north row next to wheat in east-west rows was 6% greater while the south row next to soybean yielded 18% greater than the nonborder rows. In north-south rows, the east outside row next to wheat yielded 23% greater and the west row next to soybean yielded 27% greater than the nonborder rows. In the two-crop system, yield of the outside corn rows was enhanced similarly compared with the nonborder rows in both row orientations. Wheat yield in the 5-ft section next to soybean was 4% greater than the center 5-ft section and 6% greater than the 5-ft section next to corn in east-west rows and 9 and 17% greater in north-south rows. Results from this 4-yr study indicate that wheat planted between corn and soybean strips improved soybean production over the two-crop system without adversely affecting wheat yields. Corn production was enhanced by 9 to 12% in north-south rows and 2 to 7% in east-west rows in both the two- and three-crop strip systems.

Merr.] into winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) may increase soybean yields compared with doublecropping. Once the soybean crop is established, however, it competes with wheat, which may lead to reductions in soybean plant population and seed yield. A skip-row planting pattern of wheat has been shown to reduce intercrop competition and increase soybean productivity. Row orientation may also influence soybean seedling survival and seed yield. We conducted research to compare soybean response to the effects of row orientation and planting pattern when relay intercropped into winter wheat. Agripro 'Victory' wheat was planted in solid intercropped and skip-row intercropped patterns near Manhattan and Rossville, KS, in 1988 and 1989. Row orientation was north-south or east-west. 'Resnik' soybean was intercropped into wheat at late boot. In 1989, wheat yield was 11% greater from north-south rows than east-west rows. Planting pattern did not influence wheat yield. Solid wheat stands were detrimental to soybean seedlings. Solid intercropped soybean had 29% stand reductions, and 34% lower yields than skip-row intercropped soybean. Photosynthetically active radiation from soybean emergence to late milk stage of wheat was from 3 to 63% greater in skip-row intercropped vs. solid intercropped plots depending upon row direction and time of day. Row direction did not significantly influence soybean yield.

EM Thell) have shown potential for forage production when spring-seeded as monocrops (WMC) or as intercrops (IC) and doublecrops (DC) in binary combinations with barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) or oat (Avena sativa L.). Producers are frequently tempted to overwinter the winter cereals for seed production in the second year. The current study evaluated the influence of forage harvest during the establishment year on the winter hardiness and seed production of winter wheat and triticale in the WMC, IC, and DC cropping systems. Clippings of the WMC and IC as well as planting of the DC were timed to correspond to jointing (DS1), boot (DS2), late milk (DS3) and grain harvest (DS4). Planting of the winter cereal after grain harvest (DS4) of the spring cereal simulated the conventional cropping system. All plots were clipped in late fall to remove aftermath prior to overwintering. Consequently treatments first clipped at DS1 received five clippings compared with DS4 which received only two clippings. Subsequent winter survival and grain yield of both winter species were reduced in the WMC and IC compared with DC treatments. However, increasing the frequency of clipping during the year of establishement in the WMC and IC improved grain yield and winter survival in the winter wheat compared with treatments receiving less frequent or no clipping. Less consistent results were observed for winter triticale. Overwintering spring-planted winter wheat and triticale is not a suitable means for seed production compared with conventional fall planting or reseeding to spring cereals.

The objective of a 2-yr experiment on intercropping rice (Oryza sativa L.) and legumes was to assess effect on yield in India. Rice was intercropped with mungbean (Vigna radiata L.), soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), ricebean (Vigna umbellata L.) and blackgram [Vigna mungo (L.) Hepper.] on a well-drained sandy loam soil in the Gangetic Alluvial Plains (Fleuvudent). Rice/legume planting ratios (row basis) were 2:1, 4:1 simultaneously planted or legumes were planted (2:1 planting ratio) at 30 d after planting of rice (defered planting). Control plots were monocrops of rice and legumes with each species fertilized according to soil test recommendations. Rice + mungbean, rice + soybean, rice + peanut and rice + blackgram intercroppings resulted in higher yields than that of rice + ricebean intercropping. Rice + ricebean and rice + blackyielded higher when deferred planting was practised. All intercropping treatments of rice + legumes save rice + ricebean (simultaneous planting) were greater in land equivalent ratio (LER), relative net return (RNR), monetary advantage (MA), etc. The competitive ratios (CR) of rice was above one in deferred planting except rice + blackgram and rice + mungbean in 1985 and only rice + blackgram in 1986. Thus, LER, RNR, and MA showed that intercropping of rice + legumes other than ricebean resulted in greater productivity per unit of land than monocultures.

Merr.] into winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in areas of Kansas where length of growing season and inadequate rainfall limit the productivity of doublecropped soybeans. Objectives of the study were to: (i) examine the response of soybean and wheat cultivars to solid and skip-row planting patterns, and (ii) compare soybean and wheat performance when planted in monocropped and intercropped systems across a range of environments. Winter wheat cultivars Agripro 'Mustang' and Pioneer '2157' were planted in 10-in. rows in a solid and one-out-of-three skip-row pattern at six environments in northern and western Kansas in 1985 and 1986. All but one environment was irrigated. Soybean cultivars 'Sparks', 'Sherman', and Asgrow 'A3127' were planted alone or intercropped into wheat at the late boot stage. Wheat yields in skip-row patterns were 13% lower than those in monocrop solid patterns, whereas intercropping soybeans into solid-seeded wheat reduced wheat yields 4%. Intercropped soybeans yielded 72% of monocropped soybeans. Soybean yields in the two intercropped planting patterns were similar, but there was a tendency for yields in the skip-row pattern to be greater than those in the solid planting pattern. No genotype X planting pattern interactions were observed for either crop. Relay intercropping did not appear to be a viable production option in far western kansas, where soybeans were less able to compete effectively with wheat. In eastern Kansas under dryland or irrigated conditions, or under irrigated conditions in the central part of the state, relay intercropping has the potential to increase gross returns over those of doublecropping or monocrop wheat production. Intercrop gross returns were only marginally higher than those for monocrop soybean production.

However, few studies have reported N absorption, use, and balance in a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) relay intercropping system. This study aimed to determine the effects of different N application rates and ratios at different maturation stages on the yield and N use of peanut in this system. Nitrogen (300 kg ha(-1)) was applied the day before sowing and at jointing, booting, and anthesis in peanut at the following ratios: 50-50-0-0 (N1), 35-35-0-30% (N2), and 35-0-35-30 (N3) (control: 0 kg ha(-1)). Nitrogen isotope-labeled urea was used under the same conditions in microplot. Peanut pod yield increased by 19.0 and 24.8% under the N2 and N3 treatments, respectively, compared with the N1 treatment. Applying N at three stages and withholding N until booting improved the N derived from fertilizer in peanut, promoted the distribution of N-15 to pods, and increased pod yield. The N-15 experiment revealed that N uptake at different growth stages of peanut was 20.7 to 30.4% higher under N3 than under N2, increasing N harvest index and apparent N recovery efficiency compared with N2. The N3 treatment also significantly increased the N recovery efficiency and the agronomic N use efficiency and reduced the apparent N loss. Therefore, applying N fertilizer as in the N3 treatment could be appropriate for wheat-peanut relay intercropping systems in China.

However, it is impossible to harvest two crops in the same year under the cotton/peanut rotation. And continuous cropping constraints as indicated by inhibited crop growth and development as well as yield decline remain under continuous cotton/peanut intercropping. We hypothesized that a combination of intercropping and rotation can resolve these constraints or challenges. In a preliminary experiment, the traditional intercropping (TIC) of cotton and peanut was established and studied using monocultures of cotton (MC) or peanut (MP) as the control. Field experiments were then conducted to develop an alternate intercropping (AIC) of wide-strip cotton/peanut intercropping in combination with strip rotation (strips of the two crops were grown inter-annually in an alternate manner). Crop productivity, leaf photosynthesis, dry matter accumulation and partitioning, and main nutrient uptake as well as input-output and net returns of the new system were evaluated as compared with TIC, MC and MP for two consecutive years. Results showed that crop productivity varied significantly with cropping systems. On average, the TIC increased seed cotton yield by 16.9% and decreased peanut yield by 5.6%, while the AIC increased cotton yield by 21% without sacrificing peanut yield. The AIC increased the biological yield of peanut by 3.8% and harvest index by 2.4%; it increased the biological yield of cotton by 3.8% compared to TIC. AIC increased uptake of N, P and K in peanut by 6.3, 11.5 and 7.3%, as well as net photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll content and maximum leaf area index of peanut by 7.2, 8.9 and 4.4%, respectively, relative to TIC. Crop output value under AIC was 4.5% higher than that under TIC but the input value was the same; thus the net return under AIC exceeded that under TIC by 10%. The AIC increased crop productivity and economic return without additional input compared to traditional intercropping, thus is a promising alternative cropping system in the Yellow River valley and other areas with similar ecology."

The parasitic plant is a socioeconomic problem that has forced some resource-poor farmers to abandon their farms due to high infestation. This study was designed in order to elucidate farmers' perceptions of Striga control measures and to determine their potential adoption in two villages in western Kenya. Participatory rural appraisals and individual interviews were conducted in 2009 and 2010 in a sample of 128 and 120 households in Kaura and Kogweno-Oriang villages in Homabay and Rachuonyo districts, respectively. The results revealed that crop production was the main occupation in most households. The farmers identified Striga as one of the major constraints to maize, sorghum, and finger millet production. According to the farmers, the most popular control measures were hand-pulling, crop rotation, and intercropping, even though rotational systems might need a longer timeframe to reduce the soil seed bank of Striga. Although the level of Striga infestation and damage were increasing in the farmers' fields, the adoption of the control options was limited. The reason for the low adoption level of the control methods by the farmers is because they are too risky as there is no guarantee of a direct pay-off in increased crop yield. Farmer-led evaluation and adaptation of the various Striga control technologies in real-life situations will facilitate the choice of appropriate options and facilitate their uptake.

The fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a voracious and generalist insect pest native to America. It was first detected in West Africa in 2016 and rapidly spread across the continent. The indiscriminate use of chemical insecticides poses risks to human health and threatens the few natural enemies present in these environments. Despite the existence of alternative control measures in America (e.g. genetically modified maize), efforts are needed to develop environmentally friendly approaches that are affordable for smallholder farmers and compatible with the African context. Literature. In this literature review, we describe the potential of the available alternative controls methods which include cultural, physical, biological and semiochemical strategies. The potential of their association is discussed considering their cost-benefice balance and local economic and agricultural context. Conclusions. Several affordable mitigation options could be implemented rapidly, pending proper communication efforts, including (i) the promotion of indigenous natural enemies by promoting refuges and training smallholder farmers on their identification; (ii) cultural methods, mainly by planting directly after the main rainfalls, as well as performing intercropping and crop rotation; and (iii) the use of microbial biopesticides, and avoiding some of the already identified ineffective chemical insecticides."

However, the effect of sowing ratio on forage yields and economic benefits of oat (Avena sativa L.) and common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) intercropping remains largely unknown. A 2 yr field experiment was conducted with seven sowing ratios (sowing ratio of oat as 0, 25, 33, 50, 67, 75, and 100%) for oat and common vetch intercropping in northeastern China. Intercropping showed significant advantages in forage yield, land equivalent ratio (LER), and net income in the 2 yr. Oat was the dominant partner in the mixtures, strongly outcompeting common vetch. A sowing ratio of oat at 50% produced the highest forage yields of 10.8-11.1 t ha(-1) in spring seeding and 4.9-7.7 t ha(-1) in summer seeding, which were 28.7-66.4% and 12.6-166.9% higher than those in monocultures, respectively, if we considered two years together. In any case, oat forage yield just slightly decreased with a decreasing share in the intercrops, whereas common vetch forage yields strongly decreased. The highest LERs were detected in a sowing ratio of oat at 50%, which was 11-57% higher than other sowing ratios. Similarly, the highest annual net incomes of US$1,336 and $1,088 ha(-1) were also obtained in a sowing ratio of oat at 50% in the 2 yr. In conclusion, oat and common vetch intercropping have greater forage yields and economic benefits compared with the corresponding monocultures in the agro-pastoral region of China, and a sowing ratio of oat at 50% is recommended.

The objective was to determine the influence of the land use systems (a combination of crop-fallow sequences and intercropping types) on soil hydraulic properties obtained by disc permeameter and double-ring infiltration measurements. The experiment was established in 1989 as a split-plot design with four replications. The main plots were natural fallow, planted Pueraria phaseoloides and planted Leucaena leucocephala. The subplots were 1 year of maize/cassava intercrop followed by 3-year fallow (25% cropping intensity), or 2-year fallow (33% cropping intensity), or 1-year fallow (50% cropping intensity), or no fallow period (100% cropping intensity). Water infiltration rates and sorptivities were measured under saturated and unsaturated flow. Irrespective of land use, infiltration rates at the soil surface (121-324 cm h(-1)) were greater than those measured at 30 cm depth (55-144 cm h(-1)). This indicated that fewer large pores were present below 30 cm depth compared with 0-30 cm, depth. Despite some temporal variation, sorptivities with the highest mean value of 93.5 cm h(-1/2) increased as the cropping intensity decreased, suggesting a more continuous macropore system under less intensive land use systems. This was most likely due to continuous biopores created by perennial vegetation under long fallow systems. Intercropped maize and cassava yields also increased as cropping intensity decreased. The weak relationship between crop yields and hydraulic conductivity/infiltration rates suggests that the rates were not limiting.

J	Odunze, AC				Odunze, AC			Effect of forage legume incorporation on selected soil chemical properties in the Northern Guinea savanna of Nigeria	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE			English	Article						"forage legumes; soil organic carbon; exchangeable cations; Nigeria"		The Nigerian savanna soils are low in fertility, organic matter and cation exchange capacity. The traditional method of improving the fertility and productivity of soils of the savanna is through natural fallowing which typically takes three to five years. The method is no longer suitable for most farmers because of the rapid growth of Population in developing countries and the resulting intensive cultivation of agricultural land. In this study, a short fallow technique was adopted using forage legumes. Selected soil chemical properties were also evaluated. Incorporation of most of the legume residues significantly (P < 0.05) increased soil organic carbon more than control treatment especially when 5.0 t ha(-1) of organic matter is incorporated. The application rate of 5.0 t ha(-1) gave higher soil organic carbon content than the 2.5 t ha(-1) rates. However, the incorporation of maize stover and legume residue resulted in significantly higher soil organic carbon than the initial rate of 5.65 g kg(-1). Exchangeable cations were increased by the legume incorporation more than in the control. The impacts created by legume incorporation were mostly felt at the topsoil (0-15 cm). Adoption of the technology might be hindered by the fact that these legumes do not have immediate food grain benefit like the grain legumes (i.e., cowpea and lablab). The fallow legumes and food crops could be intercropped either simultaneously or in a relay pattern with cereal (maize or sorghum) to improve productivity of the land for sustainable food crop production.

The catch or trap cropping is done to induce the germination of parasitic weeds seed but do not allowing it to produce seed. The effective catch crops viz., fodder millet (Panicum miliaceum L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor Moench.), corn (Zea mays L.), sudangrass (Sorghum Sudanense Stapf.) have been identified for the management of Striga asiatica [(L.) O.Kuntze] and the cowpea (Vigna catjang Walp.) for S. gesnerioides [(Wild.) Vatke]. Cotton (Gossypium spp.), soybean (Glycine mar L. Merr.) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) are the important trap crops. Intercropping of soybean or peanut with sorghum effectively controls the S. hermonthica [(Del.) Benth]. Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) is a useful trap crop for Orobanche ramosa L., O. cernua Loefl, O. crenata Forsk. and O. aegyptica Pers. In India, sunnhemp (Crotolaria juncea L.), blackgram (Phaseolus mungo L.), greengram (Phaseolus aureus Roxb.) and sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) have shown good potential for Orobanche control. Rotation of trap crop reduces the population of Orobanche and 3 to 4 years long rotation of catch/trap crops provides its effective control. Sorghum/maize/paddy (Oryza sativa)-tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) rotation reduces the infestation and weed biomass of Orobanche. Relay cropping of tobacco in capsicum (Capsicum annuum L.), onion (Allium cepa L.) and peanut also reduces the incidence of Orobanche.

INTERCROPPING CORN WITH A COMBINATION OF TREE SPECIES TO CONTROL WEEDS	PLANTA DANINHA			English	Article						"Zea mays; Gliricidia sepium; Mimosa caesalpiniifolia; green corn; grain yield"	"SEEDLING GROWTH; WATER; GERMINATION; SURVIVAL; RICE; L."	The combination of crop residues or crop extracts is often more advantageous in controlling weeds, than the application of each residue or extract singly. This suggests that in intercropping with maize, the combination of tree species can be more advantageous than species isolated in weed control. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of intercropping with a combination of leguminous on the weed growth and corn yield. A randomized-block design with split plots (cultivars in plots) and five replicates was established. The cultivars BR 205 and AG 1041 were subject to the following treatments: two weedings (A), intercropping with sabia (B), gliricidia (C), gliricidia + sabia (D) and no weeding (E). In the B and C, 30 viable seeds m(-2) of the leguminous were sown. In the D, 15 seeds of each species were sown m(-2). The legumes were sown by random casting during corn planting. The sequence of the best treatments in reducing the growth of weeds is A > B = C = D = E. The sequence of the best treatments when are considered the yields of baby corn, green corn and grain is A > B > C > D > E. The cultivars do not differ in regards to the reduction in weed growth. In terms of corn yield cultivar BR 205 is the best.	"[Silva, P. S. L.; Silva, E. M.; Silva, P. I. B.; Fernandes, J. P. P.] Univ Fed Rural Semi Arido, Mossoro, RN, Brazil; [Chicas, L.

Indigo was grown as an intercrop during the dry season and incorporated as green manure for wet season rice. Dry season crop yields were generally not affected by the indigo intercrop but indigo green manure had a positive effect on rice yields. At the same level of nitrogen (N) inputs, indigo-N produced higher yields than urea-N which may be due to high inorganic N losses.

NOTULAE BOTANICAE HORTI AGROBOTANICI CLUJ-NAPOCA			English	Article						"chemical composition; chlorophyll content; crop systems; grain yield; phenotypic evaluation"	"GERMPLASM; TRAITS; GROWTH"	Field experiments were conducted two consecutive years, in order to investigate runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus L.) cultivated in pure crop system and in intercropping system. To achieve the desired aim, we set the following objectives: study of runner bean plant phenology, study of assimilating pigments content in the runner bean leaves, agro productivity study of runner bean crop, yield of runner bean crop, study of chemical composition of runner bean dry seeds. The studied experimental factor was the trellis system with six variants: (V1) - trellis, with double rows, on individual string, (V2)- trellis, with a single row, on individual string, (V3)- trellis, in a single row, on synthetic net (17 cm mesh), (V4)- intercropping with common maize plants, (V5)- intercropping with sunflower plants, (V6)- intercropping with Jerusalem artichoke plants. Runner bean yield ranged from 3,610 kg ha-' (V2) to 1,684 kg ha(-1) (V6) (first year) and from 3,170 kg ha-' (V2) to 1,189 kg ha' (V6) (second year). Runner bean dry seeds contain: crude protein 22.65% (V6)- 25.47% (V3), crude fat 1.91% (V6)- 2.16% (V4), crude fibre 5.41% (V4)- 5.81% (V5) and nitrogen free extractive substances 62.11% (V3)- 64.92% (V4). The best variant of trellis for runner bean crop was the single row trellis system on individual string and the best intercropping system was intercropping with sunflower.

Africa faces serious challenges in feeding its rapidly growing human population owing to the poor productivity of maize and sorghum, the most important staple crops for millions of smallholder farmers in the continent, with yields being among the lowest in the world. 2. A complex of lepidopterous stemborers attack cereals in Africa. However, their effective control is difficult, largely as a result of the cryptic and nocturnal habits of moths, and protection provided by host stem for immature pest stages. Moreover, current control measures are uneconomical and impractical for resource-poor farmers. 3. An ecological approach, based on companion planting, known as push-pull', provides effective management of these pests, and involves combined use of inter- and trap cropping systems where stemborers are attracted and trapped on trap plants with added economic value (pull'), and are driven away from the cereal crop by antagonistic intercrops (push'). 4. Novel defence strategies inducible by stemborer oviposition have recently been discovered, leading to the attraction of egg and larval parasitoids, in locally adapted maize lines but not in elite hybrids. We also established that landscape complexity did not improve the ecosystem service of biological control, but rather provided a disservice by acting as a source' of stemborer pests colonising the crop. 5. Here we review and provide new data on the direct and indirect effects of the push-pull approach on stemborers and their natural enemies, including the mechanisms involved, and highlight opportunities for exploiting intrinsic plant defences and natural ecosystem services in pest management in smallholder farming systems in Africa.

In three growing seasons and without irrigation or fertilisation, we have examined two basic field pea cultivars (Kosmaj, OS Adam) and one leafless cultivar (OS Letin) intercropped with oat (NS Jadar), with seeding rates, field pea: oat - 100:10%; 100:20% Results have shown that basic type cultivars have better overall development and higher yields compared to leafless cultivar, whether grown as single crops or in the mixture. Basic cultivars (OS Adam, Kosmaj) achieved higher protein content, compared to cultivar Letin, 163.9 g kg(-1), 153.3 g kg(-1), 136 g kg(-1), respectively. Yields were higher in 100:20% mixtures, compared to 100:10% mixtures and single grown crops, and we conclude that intercropping these species is superior to cultivating them separately.

Since environmental conditions have a strong impact on the growth and nutrient capture in roots and shoots of individual catch crop species, we anticipated that mixtures will be more durable and efficient in nutrient capture due to compensatory effects among component species. We tested this hypothesis and determined the nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation in the shoots and roots of four catch crop species grown in pure vs. mixed stands at two sites for two or three years. Element concentrations were determined in the root and shoot biomass of each species and used to calculate the nutrient pool fixed in the root or shoot biomass. A qPCR-based technique was applied to quantify the root biomass of individual species based on species-specific DNA sequences. Despite considerable variation across environments, the overall plant biomass of white mustard (Sinapis alba), lacy phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia) and bristle oat (Avena strigosa) was similar and higher than that of Egyptian clover (Trifolium alexandrinum). While pure stands varied 6-to 24-fold in shoot biomass depending on environmental conditions, the variation was only ~3-fold for catch crop mixtures, with less pronounced variation in the root biomass. In general, the root biomass was comparable to the shoot biomass in each species. Roots contributed 26-46% of the nitrogen and 36-48% of the phosphorus to the total accumulation of these nutrients in the catch crop biomass, thus emphasizing the importance of plant roots as belowground nutrient pool for potential carry-over of nutrients to the subsequent crop. Although the mixture was mostly dominated by two of the four species, namely mustard and phacelia, it captured similar or even larger amounts of nutrients than the best-performing pure stand under any growth condition. This was the case for shoot-and for root-bound nutrients. Our results indicate that catch crop mixtures have higher durability than pure cultures to environmental variations. The amount of nitrogen captured by the mixture meets the average postharvest nitrogen that is left over by a wide range of cash crops, thus emphasizing that catch crop mixtures represent an efficient nutrient management tool in crop rotations.

Allelopathy has emerged as a pragmatic approach to solve multiple issues in modern agriculture. Multiple approaches including crop rotations, cover crops, intercropping, mulching, crop residue incorporation and water extracts application are being used to explore allelopathy for pest management, stress mitigation, and growth enhancement in crop production. Allelopathy offers natural control of weeds, insect-pests and diseases. Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites at higher rates and their role in stress signaling provides excellent defense against abiotic stresses. Allelochemicals exuded in plant rhizosphere improve nutrient acquisition through the processes of solublization, biological nitrification inhibition, chelation and selected retention. Allelochemicals promote growth at low concentration; however suppress the growth if applied at high concentration. Allelopathic water extracts of sorghum, brassica, sunflower, rice, wheat, maize and moringa improve crop growth when applied at low concentrations. In this manuscript, potential application of the allelopathic phenomenon in crop production is discussed. If wisely planned, use of this phenomenon is quite effective in managing agricultural pests and improving the productivity of agricultural systems.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of using soil cover crops in succession and rotation with onion crops in different soil management systems on the total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and C and N fractions in soil aggregates, and bulk soil. The experiment was implemented in April 2007 with eight treatments: succession of onion and maize in a no-tillage system (NTS) (T1); rotation of soil cover crops (winter) and biennial onion in a NTS (T2); rotation of maize, winter grasses, and onion in a NTS (T3); succession of summer legume and annual onion in a NTS (T4); rotation of summer grass, winter grasses, and annual onion in a NTS (T5); succession of summer legume, winter grass, and annual onion in a NTS (T6); succession of maize and onion in a conventional tillage system (CTS) (T7); and succession of intercrops of soil cover crops (summer), and annual onion in a NTS (T8). Undisturbed soil samples were collected in the 0.0-5.0, 5.0-10.0, and 10.0-20.0 cm soil layers in July 2014, and their aggregate (8.0 to 2.0 mm) and bulk soil (<2 mm) fractions were separated to evaluate their TOC, TN, particulate organic carbon and particulate organic nitrogen (OCP and ONP respectively), and mineral-associated organic carbon and mineral-associated organic nitrogen (OCM and ONM respectively). Soil turning due to the CTS in T7 (0.0-5.0 cm) reduced TOC, OCP, OCM, TN, ONP, and ONM, in the soil aggregates and in the bulk soil, when compared with the NTS with the use of soil cover crops in succession or rotation with onion crops (T1-T6 and T8). T6 increased the TOC, TN, OCP, OCM, ONP, and ONM contents in the soil aggregates and bulk soil when compared with the successions with only grasses or only legumes. T1 increased the soil TOC and TN contents in aggregates compared with the same succession in CTS. T8 had higher OCP (0.0-20.0 cm) and ONP (5.0-10.0 cm) contents in aggregates than in the bulk soil. In general, aggregates had higher TOC and OCM contents, and bulk soil had higher TN, OCP, ONP and ONM contents. The main changes resulting from the management systems and soil cover crop combinations used were observed in the particulate fraction, especially in the soil aggregates."

To understand the effects of row configuration on radiation interception and productivity in common vetch-oat strip intercropping under low-input conditions, a field experiment with seven treatments of different numbers of rows for common vetch and oat [1:1 (RI), 2:1 (S21), 3:1 (S31), 3:2 (S32), 4:2 (S42), 4:3 (S43), and 5:3 (S53)] and sole cropping treatments were conducted in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan plateau (QTP) during 2016 and 2017. Compared with sole cropping, intercropping significantly increased plant height but decreased the net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and the fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (integral IPAR) of common vetch in the configurations with narrow strip width such as RI, S21, S31, and S32; as the common vetch strip width increased, their performance tended to be similar with common vetch sole cropping. Plant height, Pn, and integral IPAR were significantly greater for intercropped oat than oat sole cropping, but decreased as the width of the oat strip increased. On average, intercropping systems improved radiation use efficiency (RUE) by 27 % in comparison to the value expected from the monocultures. The land equivalent ratio (LER) was 1.20 (flowering stage) and 1.14 (maturity stage) on average, and greater than one in all intercropping treatments. Moreover, oat yield in border rows was significantly higher by 41-52 % compared with inner rows, indicating that the border row effect of the dominate crop is a key to increasing yield in common vetch-oat strip intercropping. In order to maximize the utilization of the border row effect, one row or two rows of oat strip which can mitigate intraspecific competition is recommended under low-input conditions. The optimal row configurations RI and S32, which achieved the highest RUE (2.9-3.4 g MJ-1), LER (1.16-1.27), yield (1257-1502 g m2), and monetary advantage index, can be applied in common vetch-oat strip intercropping for sustainable forage production in alpine regions."

J	Aweto, AO				Aweto, AO			Trees in shifting and continuous cultivation farms in Ibadan area, southwestern Nigeria	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING			English	Article						"trees; farms; Gliricidia; oil palm"	"LEUCAENA-LEUCOCEPHALA LAM; SOUTHERN NIGERIA; SOIL; GLIRICIDIA; MAIZE"	This study compares the types and density of tree species in continuous cultivation farms at the fringe of Ibadan city, Nigeria, with shifting cultivation farms in a rural district near the city. Both categories of farm are used for cultivating field crops of maize, cassava and yams that are intercropped. Tree density is much higher in continuously farmed plots at the city outskirts, where tree density averaged 511 trees/ha compared to 143 trees/ha in shifting cultivation farms in the countryside. In spite of the general similarity in tree flora between the two categories of farmlands, certain tree species are more abundant in one than the other. Gliricidia sepium, an exotic tree legume that improves soil fertility, is more abundant on the continuous cultivation farms while the oil palm, Elaeis guineensis, is more abundant on the shifting cultivation farms. Certain tree species such as Myrianthus arboreus, Alchornea laxiflora and Blaghia sapida were restricted to the shifting cultivation farms and Trema guineensis to the continuously cultivated plots. It seems that the farmers at the urban fringe, having eliminated the bush fallow period, depend mainly on trees on the farmland, especially G. sepium, for the maintenance of soil fertility, as they do not apply fertilizers, while the shifting cultivators retain mainly trees of economic and utilitarian importance on their farms. It is advocated that the shifting cultivators should preserve more trees as farmers at the urban fringe do. This will not only facilitate tree regeneration, on which restoration of soil fertility during the fallow period largely depends, but also help to conserve soil fertility during cropping and to augment farmers' fuelwood supplies.

One of the most effective strategies is the push-pull system, which takes advantage of the behavioral response of the insect to the integration of repellent stimuli; it expels the pest out of the main crop (push), while attracting stimuli (attractants) pull the pest to an alternative crop or trap (pull). The objective of this study was to design a push-pull system to controlSpodoptera frugiperdain maize crops (Zea mays) in Morelos, Mexico. Data on reproductive potential, larvae development, food consumption and olfactometry were used to obtain a Trap Plant Selection Index (TRAPS) based on Principal Component Analysis. This TRAPS was used to select the most suitable plants. The degree of repellency of potential plants to be used as the trap crop was studied with four-way olfactometers.S. frugiperdafemales oviposited more eggs onBrachiaria hybridcv.

The mechanisms behind this effect, however, are still poorly understood particularly when intercropping cereals with non-legume dicots. To explore the role of root exudates in this positive interaction, oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) were cultivated in hydroponics either as intercrop (IC) or monocrop (MC) under Fe-sufficient (+Fe) or Fe-deficient (-Fe) conditions. Intercropping improved chlorophyll (Chl) concentration, photosynthesis rates and the active Fe concentration in the young leaves of -Fe oilseed rape. Additionally, intercropping under Fe deficiency enhanced the root Fe-reductase activity and the release of organic acids and phenolic compounds by oilseed rape and the release of phytosiderophores by the barley plants. Resupply of sparingly soluble Fe(OH)3 to -Fe plants improved leaf Chl and increased the Fe concentration of barley plants under both MC and IC. Contrastingly, oilseed rape was able to use Fe(OH)(3)only under IC conditions. Moreover, oilseed rape-barley intercropping under + Fe conditions also improved Chl, photosynthesis and nitrogen uptake in oilseed rape. This positive effect of IC independent from Fe acquisition makes intercropping an attractive practice even under non-Fe stress conditions.

Forage quality attributes measured were crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF), water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) and ash content. In both experiments, dry matter (DM) and percentage dry matter (DM%) were improved by intercropping compared with beans sole crops. Intercropping enhanced CP and NDF contents and WSC compared with beans and wheat sole crops, respectively. Nitrogen (N) applications up to 75 kg/ha produced the optimal intercrop forage yield and crude protein content. This input of N is smaller than that for other forage crops.

In sugarcane, the negative impacts of a black gram intercrop on crop yields, rhizosphere soil properties and benefit: cost ratio have been reported. The possible allelopathic potential of black gram seeds on the germination, seedling emergence and root elongation of other commercial crops is reported here. The effects of imbibed seeds of black gram, their aqueous leachate and seed extracts on the germination and root elongation of seeds of four test crops viz. wheat, maize, gram and lentil, both under aseptic and soil conditions, were investigated. Inhibitory effects were evident in all the bioassays of seeds of these crops. The black gram seeds directly and leachates were highly inhibitory but the aqueous seed extract was less so. The observations indicate a release of inhibitory substances from black gram seeds leading to the observed inhibitory effects.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the suppression imposed by mesotrione in Brachiaria brizantha, intercropped with maize. The trial was conducted in a randomized block design with four replications, corresponding to seven doses of mesotrione (0; 12; 24; 48; 96; 144 and 192 g ha(-1)), a control (corn without interference) and a treatment with beard grass grown as a single. Both crops were sown on the same day. The herbicide was applied at 20 days after emergence of the species. Mesotrione showed the greatest potential for plant toxicity in B. brizantha plants, when applied at a dose of 192 g ha(-1).

Several studies have shown that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) play a key role for the improved grain yields in intercropping systems through facilitative nutrient and water uptake via the common mycorrhizal network (CMN), yet little is known on the rate of hyphal spread. Here we hypothesized that AMF species differ in the rate of extraradical hyphae to spread from one plant to another, thereby affecting the growth of the intercropped plants. To test our hypothesis, we established experimental microcosms in the greenhouse, in which one pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) and two finger millet (Eleusine coracana) plantlets were kept in separate pots, connected by soil bridges of 5 or 12 cm length, inaccessible to roots but accessible to fungal hyphae. The pigeon pea plants were pre-inoculated with Claroideoglomus etunicatum, Rhizophagus fasciculatus or Rhizophagus irregularis. All three AMF species led to a strong growth promotion compared to uninoculated control of the short microcosms and more than doubled the biomass of pigeon pea. The biomass as well the phosphorus content of finger millets connected by AMF to the pigeon pea differed with the length of the soil bridge and the species of AMF. By applying 15N isotopes to the soil of pigeon pea pots we revealed that in both lengths of the microcosms R. fasciculatus and C. etunicatum transported nitrogen from pigeon pea to finger millet across distances of up to 12 cm but R. irregularis did not. Furthermore, by destructive sampling, we estimated a hyphal spread of 4.1 mm d-1 by C. etunicatum across a 12 cm soil bridge. We conclude that the row distance between the crops and the choice of AMF species play a crucial role for the application of AMF as biofertilizer.

The intercropping systems comprised rice alone, rice + maize, rice + sesbania, rice + mungbean, rice + ricebean, rice + cowpea and rice + pigeonpea while wheat, lentil and Egyptian clover were sown as relay crops on residual soil moisture just after the harvest of rice previously intercropped with forage legumes and non-legumes at zero tillage. The results revealed that among the three sets of rice based inter/relay cropping systems, the overall production level of total rice grain yield equivalent (TRGYE) was higher for rice-based Egyptian clover set followed by lentil oriented to the lowest for wheat oriented set. Production level of TRGYE was highest (10.95 t ha(-1)) for rice + maize - Egyptian clover inter/relay cropping system followed by rice + sesbania - Egyptian clover inter/relay cropping system (10.29 t ha(-1)) compared to lowest (6.48 t ha(-1)) for rice alone wheat cropping system. However, rest of the cropping systems gave TRGYE ranging between 7.18 to 10.17 t ha(-1). Regarding residual soil fertility, residual soil nitrogen was improved in all leguminous inter/relay cropping systems as compared to sole rice as well as non-legume inter/relay cropping systems. Similarly residual soil organic matter was also improved in all inter/relay cropping systems. However, Egyptian clover oriented inter/relay cropping systems increased more residual nitrogen and organic matter as compared to lentil oriented inter/relay cropping systems, while wheat oriented inter/relay cropping systems either decreased or did not add nitrogen and organic matter in the soil. Residual soil phosphorus and potassium were depleted in all inter/relay cropping systems compared with the initial soil analysis. Similarly, as compared to rice alone, all intercropping systems showed similar trend in both years. Since rice-based leguminous inter/relay cropping systems proved to be more remunerative and sustainable than wheat-oriented inter/relay cropping systems, so some leguminous crop like lentil and Egyptian clover should be added in rice-based cropping system in place of wheat to sustain the yield of component crops of the cropping system and maintain the fertility status of the soil for long duration.

We hypothesized (i) that C sequestration in no-tillage soil is further enhanced by high input cropping systems and (ii) that the sequestered C is stored mainly in the mineral associated fraction. The objective of this study was to assess, in 2003, the C sequestration and stabilization in a subtropical Acrisol (Eldorado do Sul, Brazil) subjected to 18-year conventional tillage [CT] and no-tillage [NT] combined with two cropping systems: black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb) as winter cover crop - maize (Zea mays L.) as summer grain crop [Ot/M]; and black oat plus vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) as winter cover crops - maize in summer intercropped with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp) cover crop [Ot+V/M+C]. Soil C stock in the 0-20 cm layer was higher in NT than in CT, either in Ot/M (31.1 vs. 27.8 Mg ha(-1), P < 0.05) or Ot+V/M+C (37.3 vs. 32.8 Mg ha(-1), P < 0.05). Annual C sequestration rate in NT relative to CT was 0.25 Mg ha(-1) in Ot+V/M+C and 0.18 Mg ha(-1) in Ot/M, in agreement to the higher biomass-C addition and legume cover crops inclusion in Ot+V/M+C (7.6 vs 4.0 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) and to our first hypothesis. Increase in the proportion of large macroaggregates (9.51-4.76 mm) and of mean weight diameter occurred in NT soil up to 10 cm depth, both in Ot/M and Ot+V/M+C. In NT, most of the C accumulation relative to CT occurred in the mineral-associated fraction, showing the importance of organo-mineral interaction in C stabilization and supporting our second hypothesis. However, the physical protection by aggregates played equally important role by stabilizing the occluded particulate organic matter (occluded-POM) before it was further stabilized by organo-mineral interaction. No-tillage is recommended as a sustainable soil management, but to increase soil C accumulation, the potential of cropping systems such those based on legume cover crops must be concurrently explored.

J	"Oberholzer, HR; Leifeld, J; Mayer, J"				"Oberholzer, Hans Rudolf; Leifeld, Jens; Mayer, Jochen"			Changes in soil carbon and crop yield over 60 years in the Zurich Organic Fertilization Experiment, following land-use change from grassland to cropland	JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article						"agricultural management; residue input; peat; compost; sewage sludge"	"LONG-TERM EXPERIMENTS; FIELD EXPERIMENT; ROOT; MANAGEMENT; MODEL; RESIDUES; SYSTEMS; EUROPE; MATTER; STOCKS"	Changes in land-use and agricultural management affect soil organic C (SOC) storage and soil fertility. Grassland to cropland conversion is often accompanied by SOC losses. However, fertilization, crop rotation, and crop residue management can offset some SOC losses or even convert arable soils into C sinks. This paper presents the first assessment of changes in SOC stocks and crop yields in a 60-year field trial, the Zurich Organic Fertilization Experiment A493 (ZOFE) in Switzerland. The experiment comprises 12 treatments with different organic, inorganic and combined fertilization regimes. Since conversion to arable land use in 1949, all treatments have lost SOC at annual rates of 0.10-0.25 t C ha(-1), with estimated mean annual C inputs from organic fertilizers and aboveground and belowground plant residues of 0.6-2.4 t C ha(-1). In all treatments, SOC losses are still in progress, indicating that a new equilibrium has not yet been reached. Crop yields have responded sensitively to advances in plant breeding and in fertilization. However, in ZOFE high yields can only be ensured when mineral fertilizer is applied at rates typical for modern agriculture, with yields of main crops (winter wheat, maize, potatoes, clover-grass ley) decreasing by 25-50% when manure without additional mineral fertilizer is applied. ZOFE shows that land-use change from non-intensively managed grassland to cropland leads to soil C losses of 15-40%, even in rotations including legumes and intercrops, improved agricultural management and organic fertilizer application.

Keeping the urgent need of augmenting the productivity of vast rainfed upland rice ecosystem of eastern India (4.3 million ha), crop diversification technology was generated through on-farm research trials in representative upland rice soils of eastern India after analyzing agro-climatic (rainfall variability, probability and onset of effective monsoon) and edaphic (soil water retention properties) constraints and prospects. Based on rainfall analysis, direct seeded, low water requiring, rice substituted alternative upland crops namely maize, groundnut, pigeonpea, greengram and blackgram (sole or intercropping) was sown in light textured upland rice soils on 24th meteorological weeks (11-17 June) in 3 years 2000-2002 with two to three summer ploughings during pre-monsoon shower (May). Study revealed that in deficit rainfall years (2000 and 2002), when rice yield was affected adversely in light textured upland, higher rice equivalent yield and rain water use efficiency were obtained from groundnut + pigeonpea intercropping followed by sole groundnut and sole pigeonpea. Study also revealed that productivity of rice substituted crops in the same upland did not fluctuate much between rainfall excess (2001) and rainfall deficit years (2002 and 2000). Double cropping in rainfed upland rice soils was also explored through maize-horsegram/sesamum rotation with increased productivity and rainwater use efficiency. The crop diversification technology was found to be very effective for drought mitigation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Currently, the Cerrado is the main region for beef and grain production in Brazil. However, the consequences of these agricultural practices on NO, N2O and CO2 emissions from soil to atmosphere are still poorly investigated. The objectives of this study were to quantify soil emissions of NO-N, N2O-N and CO2-C in different no-till cultivation systems in comparison with native savanna vegetation. The agricultural areas included: (a) the maize and Brachiaria ruzizienses intercropping system followed by irrigated bean in rotation; (b) soybean followed by natural fallow; and (c) cotton planting over B. ruzizienses straw. The study was performed from August 2003 to October 2005 and fluxes were measured before and after planting, after fertilizations, during the growing season, before and after harvesting. NO-N fluxes in the soybean field were similar to those measured in the native vegetation. In the cornfield, higher NO-N fluxes were measured before planting than after planting and pulses were observed after broadcast fertilizations. During Brachiaria cultivation NO-N fluxes were lower than in native vegetation. In the irrigated area (bean cultivation), NO-N fluxes were also significantly higher after broadcast fertilizations. Most of the soil N2O-N fluxes measured under cultivated and native vegetation were very low (<0.6 ng N2O-N cm(-2) h(-1)) except during bean cultivation when N2O-N fluxes increased after the first and second broadcast fertilization with irrigation and during nodule senescence in the soybean field. Soil respiration values from the soybean field were similar to those in native vegetation. The CO2-C fluxes during cultivation of maize and irrigated bean were twice as high as in the native vegetation. During bean cultivation with irrigation, an increase in CO2-C fluxes was observed after broadcast fertilization followed by a decrease after the harvest. Significantly lower soil C stocks (0-30cm depth) were determined under no-tillage agricultural systems in comparison with the stocks under savanna vegetation.

The sugarcane/peanut intercropping system is a specific and efficient cropping pattern in South China. Intercropping systems change the bacterial diversity of soils and decrease disease rates. It can not only utilized light, heat, water and land resources efficiently, but also increased yield and economic benefits of farmers. Methods. We determined soil nutrients, enzymes and microbes in sugarcane/peanut intercropping system, and analyzed relevance of the soil physicochemical properties and the genes involved in N and P cycling and organic matter turnover by metagenome sequencing. Results. The results showed that sugarcane/peanut intercropping significantly boosted the content of total nitrogen, available phosphorus, total potassium, organic matter, pH value and bacteria and enhanced the activity of acid phosphatase compared to monocropping. Especially the content of available nitrogen, available phosphorus and organic matter increased significantly by 20.1%, 65.3% and 56.0% in root zone soil of IP2 treatment than monocropping treatment. The content of available potassium and microbial biomass carbon, as well as the activity of catalase, sucrase and protease, significantly decreased in intercropping root zone soil. Intercropping resulted in a significant increase by 7.8%, 16.2% and 23.0% in IS, IP1 and IP2, respectively, of the acid phosphatase content relative to MS. Metagenomic analysis showed that the pathways involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism were dominant and more abundant in intercropping than in monocropping. Moreover, the relative abundances of genes related to N cycling (glnA, GLUD1_2, nirK), P cycling (phoR, phoB) and organic matter turnover (PRDX2_4) were higher in the intercropping soil than in the monocropping soil. The relative abundance of GLUD1_2 and phoR were 25.5% and 13.8% higher in the IP2 treatment respectively,and bgIX was higher in IS treatment compared to the monocropping treatment. Genes that were significantly related to phosphorus metabolism and nitrogen metabolism (TREH, katE, gudB) were more abundant in intercropping than in monocropping. Conclusion. The results of this study indicate that the intercropping system changed the numbers of microbes as well as enzymes activities, and subsequently regulate genes involved in N cycling, P cycling and organic matter turnover. Finally, it leads to the increase of nutrients in root zone soil and improved the soil environment.

Cassava and peanut intercropping systems exhibit advantages in solar utilization and cadmium absorption, etc. However, the inner mechanisms need to be elucidated. In this study, Illumina MiSeq platform was used to reveal the rhizospheric microbes and soil quality in cassava/peanut intercropping systems, and the results provided a reference for the application of this method in studying other intercropping systems. Results Both intercropping cassava/peanut (IP) and intercropping peanut/cassava (IC) systems significantly increased available N, available K, pH value, and urease activity, comparing with that in monocropping cassava (MC) and monocropping peanut (MP) system. However, there were few effects on the total N, total P, total K, available P, organic matter, protease activity, catalase activity, sucrase activity, and acid phosphatase activity. Both IP and MP soils contained more bacteria and fungi than those in the IC and MC soils, which were mainly made of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. Intercropping remarkably increased the number of Nitrospirae in IP and IC soils comparing those in MC and MP soils. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that the abundances of DA101, Pilimelia, and Ramlibacter were positively correlated to the soil quality. These results suggest that intercropping enhances the available nitrogen content of soil through increasing the quantity of rhizospheric microbes, especially that of DA101 and Pilimelia. Conclusions The cassava/peanut intercropping system improves soil quality through increasing the available nitrogen content and abundance of DA101, Pilimelia, and Ramlibacter in the soil.

Assessing the performance of pea and lentil at different seeding densities as trap crops for the management of wireworms in spring wheat	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						"click beetles; cultural control; pulse crops; retention period; seeding density; soil-dwelling insects"	"AGRIOTES-OBSCURUS COLEOPTERA; ORIENTATION RESPONSE; ELATERIDAE; ENTOMOPATHOGENS; HERBIVORES; DIVERSITY; BEETLE"	"Wireworms, the larvae of click beetles (Elateridae), are difficult to manage due to their habitats and behaviour. Wireworms pose a major threat to the wheat crop in the north-western USA. Seed treatment with neonicotinoids, biological control management and some cultural controls are recommended to manage these pests. Trap cropping is an emerging way to manage wireworms. In strawberry and potato crops, trap cropping has been found effective at attracting wireworms away from the principal crop. An earlier study in the Golden Triangle area of Montana found that pea and lentil could be effective trap crops for managing wireworms in spring wheat. In the present study, experiments were conducted at two locations. The effectiveness of peas and lentils as trap crops with wheat at different seeding densities was assessed [pea at 0, 4, 8, 16 seeds/sq.ft. or 0, 43, 86, 172 seeds/sq.m.; lentil at 0, 6, 12, 18 OR 0, 65, 130, 194 seeds/sq.m.; both with wheat at 0, 11, 22, or 28 seeds/sq.ft. or 0, 120, 230, 300 seeds/sq.m.] in a randomized design where all three crops were intercropped. Both trap crops were found to be effective in protecting wheat at standard seeding rates of 8 seeds/sq.ft. for pea and 12 seeds/sq.ft. for lentils. At these seeding rates, higher numbers of wireworms were found to be attracted to the trap crop, resulting in higher yield (7%-10%) of the associated spring wheat plant stands at 22 seeds/sq.ft. To develop an effective trap crop strategy, the pea-wheat and lentil-wheat spatial patterns that are possible need to be assessed in further field trials. Proper design and evaluation of the cost-benefit ratio of pea and lentil as trap crops are likely to produce good results for wheat crops in Montana."

A two-year field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of N fertilizer management and straw returning on yield, NEB, and GHGI, i.e. yield-scaled net global warming potential (NGWP) and NEB-scaled NGWP, over two seasons of green onion-winter wheat relay intercropping system. The five treatments included in the field experiment were no fertilization (CK), farmer's practice (FP), optimized fertilization (OPT), optimized fertilization with 25% nitrogen input (OPT-N), and optimized fertilization + straw returning (CN). We found that compared with CK, the treatments FP, OPT, OPT-N and CN increased the total yield of wheat and green onion by 18.3%, 35.3%, 26.7% and 48.0%, respectively, and NEB by 13.8%, 41.7%, 31.1% and 53.4%, while decreasing the yield-scaled NGWP by 47.9%, 63.4%, 56.3% and 97.2%, and the NEB-NGWP by 46.7%, 66.7%, 56.7% and 96.7%, respectively. When compared to FP, treatments with lower N rates (OPT, OPT-N and CN) resulted in higher yield and NEB, and lower yield-scaled NGWP and NEB-scaled NGWP. This suggests that a reasonable reduction of N fertilizer rate could reduce GHGI without compromising yield or NEB. In practice, we recommend optimized fertilization combined with straw returning be a promising practice for achieving agronomically and economically sustainable green onion-winter wheat production in the North China Plain.

If forage legumes are associated with wheat, simultaneously or successively, they can help to reduce the impact of limiting factors through the ecological services they provide. The aim of this study was to evaluate two intercropping strategies to increase soft winter wheat yield and protein content and improve the provided ecological services (mainly N provisioning and weed control) by white clover (Trifolitum repens L.). White clover (Thfolium repens L. cv Aberdai) was intercropped with soft winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv Renan) under organic conditions. Two strategies were compared, simultaneous intercropping versus relay intercropping using three field experiments. A control treatment with sole wheat crop was included in the three field experiments. Fertilization management on organic wheat was also tested (0 versus 100 kg N applied at spring time) to evaluate its incidence on cash and cover crop yields and protein content. White clover shoot dry matter (DM) was significantly higher in simultaneous intercropping compared to relay intercropping at wheat harvest (2.2 vs. 0.1 Mg DM ha(-1)) and at cover destruction (4.5 vs. 3.1 Mg DM ha(-1)). Wheat grain yield was not affected by the intercropping strategy while the protein content was significantly lower under simultaneous intercropping system (9.1% of the grain DM) compared to relay intercropping or in wheat as sole crop (10.0% of the grain DM). At cover destruction, both simultaneous and relay intercropped white clover significantly decreased weed shoot DM compared to sole wheat crop (-1.4 Mg DM ha(-1) for relay intercropping and -1.8 Mg DM ha(-1) for simultaneous intercropping). In comparison to relay intercropping strategy, N accumulation in white clover shoot DM was higher under simultaneous intercropping strategy at wheat harvest (52 vs. 2 kg N ha(-1)) and at cover destruction (123 vs. 83 kg N ha(-1)). In conclusion, our study has highlighted the positive effect of combining a simultaneous intercropping strategy with high N availability to guarantee a sufficient level of legume shoot DM as rapidly as possible to increase both N accumulation and weed control services, thus reducing the risk of impairing winter wheat yield and protein content.

The aim of this study was to evaluate resource capture and resource use efficiency in transgenic cotton-peanut intercropping system and in their respective sole crops with using 25-50% substitution of recommended dose of nitrogen (RDN) of cotton through farmyard manure (FYM) along with 100 % RDN through urea and control (0N). Apparent crop water productivity, nutrient use efficiency, economic returns and modern intercropping indices (system productivity index, actual yield loss, intercropping advantage index, nitrogen stress factor, etc.) were measured for making better understanding of resource use efficiency. Comparisons of intercropped peanut with sole peanut were emphasized because of shrinking area of peanut in the south-east Asian region represents a threat to agricultural system sustainability. Cotton + peanut intercropping system resulted in improved water productivity (19%), nutrient use efficiency (15-20%) and monetary advantage index (16,709) as measured with modern tools of intercropping indices compared with sole crops of cotton and peanut. Peanut cultivated as sole crop attained the least resource productivity in terms of apparent crop water productivity (0.71 kg m(-3)), nutrient use efficiency (4.47 kg grain kg N-1) and total factor productivity (0.07). Among fertility levels, substitution of 25% RDN of cotton through FYM maintained higher apparent crop water productivity (17%), monetary advantage index (6%), system productivity index (9%) and nutrient use efficiencies (15-17%) over 100% RDN through urea only. This work provides basis for efficient resource use by peanut intercropping with cotton which simultaneously enhances domestic oilseed production and reduce import load of cooking oil without sacrificing the productivity of main crop of cotton in India and other cotton growing countries of the world.

Intercropping can control weeds and increase total grain productivity per land area compared to sole cropping. A field experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of intercropping on field pea and lentil yields. Intercrop treatments were spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), oat (Avena sativa L.), and radish (Raphanus sativus L.), which were harvested for grain; and winter rye (Secale cereale L.) and rapid-cycling brassica (Brassica campestris L.), which were not harvested. Intercropped lentil yields and total (lentil plus intercrop) yields were lower than or equal to weeded and unweeded sole cropped lentils in 5 of 6 site-years. Intercropped pea yields and total (pea plus intercrop) yields were lower than or equal to weeded and unweeded sole cropped pea in all site-years. Unharvested intercrops showed variable effectiveness at suppressing weeds. In lentil, winter rye intercropping reduced weed biomass compared to the unweeded control in 4 site-years, and rapid-cycling brassica reduced weed biomass in 2 site-years. In pea, winter rye, and rapid-cycling brassica treatments reduced weed biomass in all site-years. However, reductions in weed biomass were not associated with increases in grain yield. Estimated net returns to intercropping were variable, but generally similar for sole crops and intercrops on average. We did not observe consistent agronomic or economic advantages to the use of intercrops with field pea and lentil in the Minnesota environments studied."

The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) and comprised of seven treatments viz. wheat alone 30 cm spaced single row, wheat alone 75 cm spaced 4 row strips, wheat +one row of fenugreek, wheat +2 rows of fenugreek, wheat +3 rows of fenugreek, wheat +4 rows of fenugreek and fenugreek alone. Although all the intercrops reduced number of tillers m(-2), number of grains per spike, weight of grains per spike, 1000-grain weight and grain yield of wheat significantly compared to its monocropping, nonetheless, the additional yield obtained from each intercrop compensated more than the losses in wheat production. The land equivalent ratio (LER) showed 19 to 38% yield advantage of intercropping system than sole cropping. The highest yield advantage (38%) was recorded in wheat+3 rows of fenugreek followed by wheat +4 rows of fenugreek (33 %) against the minimum of 19% in wheat +1 row of fenugreek. All the intercropping systems gave substantially higher net income ha(-1) over pure stand of wheat. The maximum net income of Rs. 33647 ha(-1) was obtained from wheat +3 rows of fenugreek against the minimum of Rs. 24791 ha-1 from sole cropping. It may be concluded that wheat +3 rows of fenugreek is the best intercropping system and can be practiced on large scale by farmers.	"[Wasaya, A.; Hassan, F.

Evaluation of seed yield and competition indices for intercropped barley (Hordeum vulgare) and annual medic (Medicago scutellata)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION			English	Article						"Annual medic; Barley; Intercropping; Land equivalent ratio; Monetary advantage index; Relative crowding coefficient"	"LAND-USE EFFICIENCY; SEMIARID TROPICS; FORAGE YIELD; SYSTEMS; WHEAT; PRODUCTIVITY; ADVANTAGES; RATIO; ARRANGEMENT; PERFORMANCE"	Annual medic is an annual crop which performs well in various forage cropping systems. However availability of medic seeds is a major challenge for livestock producers in Iran. This study was conducted to determine if intercropping annual medic with barley can produce supplement medic seeds while barley grain yield as the main crop is not compromised. Two experiments were carried out at the experimental farm of University of Tehran. In experiment I (2007), a randomized complete block design with eight cropping ratios comprising of 1B:1M (one row of barley: one row of annual medic), 2B:2M, 4B:4M, 6B:6M, 6B:2M, 4B:2M, 2B:4M, and 2B:6M along with sole culture of barley and annual medic was studied. In experiment II (2009 and 2010), four new treatments were added to the intercropping ratios used in experiment I and also weeds were controlled. The overall results as indicated by competition indices including LER, RCC, and MAI revealed that regardless of ratios, the grain yield of barley when intercropped with medic was lowered. The total seed yield of both crops however, was improved in some of the intercropping ratios when compared to the monoculture of either crop. In 2007 where weeds were not controlled, the LER of the cropping ratio of 2H:2M was 1.32 which is an indication of 32 percent yield advantage over the sole cropping of the two crops. When weeds were controlled (2009 and 2010) the intercropping ratio of 6B:2M was the highest and had a LER of 1.29. The yield advantage of intercropping of medic and barley over their monoculture was also confirmed by RCC and MAI indices. The results of this study indicated that although intercropping of annual medic with barley, using 6B:2M replacement series yielded 259 kg ha(-1) less grain compared to barley sole cropping but it produced a 365 kg ha(-1) annual medic seed which has significantly higher market value than barley.

For insect pests, increasing crop species diversity via intercropping and using semiochemicals to alter local arthropod populations have separately proven effective at reducing pest densities. Here, we combine these two tactics in an effort to gain better control of Sitobion avenae (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), the English grain aphid, a major pest of cereal production worldwide. We conducted field experiments over 2 years testing the effectiveness of combining intercropping of wheat and oilseed rape with release of methyl salicylate (MeSA). We found that maximum and mean aphid densities were highest in wheat monocultures, significantly lower in intercropped plots and MeSA plots, and lowest when intercropping and MeSA release were combined by obtaining highest densities of predatory lady beetles and parasitoids rates. Importantly, grain yield and quality showed a similar pattern: they were highest for combined intercropped/MeSA plots, intermediate in plots with intercropping or MeSA alone, and lowest in control monoculture plots. Our results suggest that combining these two tactics holds significant promise for improved management of aphid populations and emphasize the need to integrate alternative pest control approaches to optimize sustainable insect pest management.

There were five levels of seed contribution, sole cropping of narbon vetch, 75% narbon vetch + 25% barley, 50% narbon vetch + 50% barley, 25% narbon vetch + 75% barley and barley sole cropping and two levels of weeds : controlled and interference. This experiment was conducted by in rows replacement series technique in the form of factorial in RCBD with three replications. Results showed that interaction of weed levels and intercropping levels was significant and the lowest number of weeds and weight of weeds occurred at 75% narbon vetch + 25% barley equal to (14.3 weeds/m(2) and 6.76 g/m(2)) combination and the highest one occurred at barley sole cropping equal to 23.3 weeds/m(2) and 9.72 g/m(2), while its number and weight in natural flour was 13 weeds/m(2) and 19.9 g/m(2), respectively. Number and weight of weeds of barley sole cropping was 63% and 43.3% higher than 75% narbon vetch +25% barley combination: respectively. So, on the basis of result of this experiment, role of 75% narbon vetch+25% barley combination was obvious in increase of forage production and decrease of weeds and the lowest species richness' was related to 50% narbon vetch + 50% of barley and 25% narbon vetch +75% barley equal to 1.34 species/m(2) and the highest one was related to narbon vetch sole cropping equal to 1.55 species/m(2). Maximum leaf area index (LAI) and crop growth rate (CGR) were obtained at stem elongation (all combination with weed) of barley, while at infected treatment this one occurred at tittering stage and totally, decrease and increase of net assimilation rate (NAR) for both controlled and infected treatments were alike. CGR of narbon vetch for controlled and infected levels was alike from six leaves to stern elongation (upward and slow) and the highest LAI was related to narbon vetch sole cropping (in controlled and infected levels) and the lowest one was related to 25% narbon vetch+75% barley combination (in controlled and infected levels). Also, as barley NAR, low seed ratio of narbon vetch had high NAR. The highest and the lowest dry forage production of barley were related to its sole cropping + infected combination equal to 6.17 t/ha and 25% narbon vetch + 75% barley + control combination equal to 1.28 t/ha, respectively. The lowest and the highest mean of sum of the biological yield was obtained from narbon vetch sole cropping+control combination equal to 7.76 t/ha and 25% narbon vetch+75% barley+control combination equal to 10.19 t/ha, respectively.

The nutrient levels comprised 0-0-0 (control), 100-0-0, 100-75-0, 100-75-75 kg NPK ha(-1) while intercropping systems were barley alone, barley+lentil, barley+gram, barley+methra, barley+linseed, barley+canola. The base barley crop was sown in 75 cm spaced 4-row strips with intercrops seeded between these strips. In all systems at different nutrient levels barley was dominant over all intercrops except canola in barley+canola system, where it proved to be better competitor. Barley showed higher values of aggressivity (+0.07), relative crowding coefficient (10.10) and competitive ratio (1.43) in barley+lentil intercropping system, while in barley+canola system, canola showed higher values of +0.43, 7.83 and 3.29 for aggessivity, relative crowding coefficient and competitive ratio, respectively.

A field experiment was carried out on wheat (Triticum aestivitin L. emend. Fiofi and Paol)-chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) mono- and intercropping with various weeding (0, 1, or 2 hand-weeding operations) and row spacing (20- or 30-cm) treatments in the eastern plateau region of India over consecutive five winter seasons (1997/2001). The experimental design was a randomized complete block with eighteen treatments replicated thrice. Significant (P < 0.05) differences were observed in yield and economics with and without weeding treatments. Chickpea yield was significantly reduced by wheat when intercropped. However, total productivity and land use efficiency were higher under the intercropping system as compared to monocrops of either species. There was a significant reduction in weed density and biomass for the intercropping system over both monocrops. Wheat facilitated an increase in nodule number and dry weight in chickpea under intercropping over monocrops, moreover, root length of chickpea was greater when intercropped. These findings suggest that intercropping wheat and chickpea increase total productivity per unit area, improve land use efficiency and suppress weeds, a menacing pest in crop production. Considering the experimental findings, wheat-chickpea (30 cm) with two weedings may be recommended for yield advantage, higher net income, more efficient utilization of resources, and weed suppression as a biological control in eastern plateau region of India.

The maximum soybean and pigeonpea yield under intercropping system was recorded with 75% of recommended dose of fertilizers + 5 tonnes farmyard manure/ha and recommended dose of fertilizers + 5 kg Zn/ha respectively. Significant reduction in seed yield of soybean (18-36%) and pigeonpea (32-47%) was noticed when planted under intercropping systems with different fertility levels compared with their sole plantings. The yield reduction in case of intercropped pigeonpea in rain deficient year 2002 (26-48%) and rain sufficient year 2003 (35-51%) specifies that this crop is less sensitive to water deficit and more sensitive to water excess than the soybean. The maximum soybean equivalent yield and land equivalent ratio were recorded with recommended dose of fertilizers + Zn during both the years. The application of recommended dose of fertilizers + Zn gave the maximum net monetary returns and remained at par with 75% of recommended dose of fertilizers + Zn and recommended dose of fertilizers alone.

Plants were grown on a brown warp soil in the temperate climate of Central Europe. The growth habit of the lentil type (spreading or erect habit) had no marked influence on growth, soil N and atmospheric N-2 acquisition of monocropped and intercropped lentil. Yield advantage of the mixture over both monocrops was only apparent in one year when mineral soil N (N-min-N) was low. The yield advantage of the barley-lentil mixture seems to be based on two effects: the greater crop growth rate (CGR) of barley in the early growth period due to the efficient use of soil N-min-N which compensates for the lower CGR of lentil in the early growth stages and the N-2 fixation of lentil which compensates for the nitrogen limitation in the soil so that the CGR of the mixture reaches the CGR of monocropped lentil in later growth stages. At maturity the level of symbiotically fixed N-2 was 154/117 kg N ha(-1) (2000/2001) in monocropped lentil and 95/41 kg N ha(-1) in intercropped lentil. The amounts of N taken up from the soil were 58/61 kg N ha(-1) (2000/2001) and 17/8 kg N ha(-1) for monocropped and intercropped lentil, respectively. Monocropped lentils took up N-min-N almost exclusively from the top 0.6 m soil layers and showed a great N sparing effect. At final harvest monocropped lentil left up to 52 kg N-min-N ha(-1) more in the soil than intercropped lentil and barley. Harvest indices of DM and N of the crop stands increased in the order: monocropped lentil < mixture < monocropped barley. The N balances of the crop stands were in the reverse order. The higher Nmin-N supply and the drier growth conditions in 2001 increased uptake of N from soil by barley, the competitive ability of barley in the mixture and the harvest indices of all crop stands and led to a reduction in N balances. It was concluded that under a temperate climate, high N use efficiency in legume-based cropping systems can be achieved by managing the cereal-lentil intercrops to enhance the symbiotic N-2 fixation without reducing the soil N uptake efficiency. It can also be achieved by growing follow-on crops before winter which have a high nitrogen uptake ability to minimize the risk of losses from the high residual N-min-N left after growing monocropped lentil.

The pots were separated into two compartments by either a solid root barrier to eliminate root contact and solute movement, by a nylon mesh (30 muM) to prevent root contact but permit solute exchange, or not separated between the compartments. Wheat plants were grown in one compartment and chickpea in the other. Two P sources were tested at 60 mg P kg(-1) soil (sodium phytate or FePO4). Under non-sterile conditions, the biomass of wheat was significantly greater when the roots were intermingled with chickpea than when the roots were separated from chickpea roots by a solid root barrier or nylon mesh. When phytate-P was applied, P concentrations in wheat (2.9 g kg(-1) in shoots and 1.4 g kg(-1) in roots) without root barrier between the two species were higher than those in the treatments with nylon mesh or with the solid root barrier separation (1.9 g kg(-1) in shoots and 1.0 g kg(-1) in roots). In contrast, P concentrations in wheat supplied with FePO4 were similar between the root separation treatments. There was no significant difference in P uptake by chickpea between the P sources or between the root separation treatments, except that P uptake was greater in the phytate treatment with the root barrier. Total P uptake from phytate was increased by 25% without root separation compared to the root separation treatments. Under sterile conditions and supply of phytate-P, the biomass of wheat was doubled when the roots were intermingled with chickpea and increased by a third with the nylon mesh separation compared to that with the solid root barrier. Biomass production in wheat at various treatments correlated with P concentration in shoot. Biomass production and P concentration in chickpea were unaffected by root separation. Total P uptake by plants was 68% greater with root intermingling and 37% greater with nylon mesh separation than that with the solid root barrier. The results suggest that chickpea roots facilitate P utilization from the organic P by wheat.

India. Results showed that the pooled yields of pearlmillet from the single crop (1525 kg ha(-1)) and from the crop intercropped with legumes (1528, 1498 or 1540 kg ha(-1)) were statistically the same. The yields from intercrop legumes were obtained as a bonus. The highest value of land equivalent ratio (1.21) was recorded for the peatlmillet + clusterbean system, which gave significantly better results than the pearlmillet + cowpea system. It was also found that the dose of nitrogen can be reduced by up to 25 % when pearlmillet is grown with legumes. However, intercrop legumes required thr recommended dose of fertilizer to produce their optimal yields. The practice of intercropping without fertilizer proved disadvantageous.

Unfolding the potential of wheat cultivar mixtures: A meta-analysis perspective and identification of knowledge gaps	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Wheat; Cultivar mixtures; Meta-regression; Overyielding; Disease reduction; Stress gradient hypothesis"	"MIXING ABILITY ANALYSIS; WINTER-WHEAT; GRAIN-YIELD; VARIETY MIXTURES; MIXED STANDS; STRIPE RUST; INTERGENOTYPIC COMPETITION; PLANT COMPETITION; GENETIC DIVERSITY; YELLOW RUST"	Increasing the biodiversity of cropped plants is a key leverage for agroecology, aiming to replace chemical inputs by ecological processes and regulations. Cultivar mixtures are a straightforward way to increase within-crop diversity, but they have so far been poorly used by farmers and they are not encouraged by advisory services. Based on the methodology developed by Kiaer et al. (2009), we achieved a meta-analysis of cultivar mixtures in wheat. Among the 120 publications dedicated to wheat, we selected 32 studies to analyze various factors that may condition the success or failure of wheat mixtures by calculating overyielding, i.e. the difference in productivity of a variety mixture compared with the weighted mean of its component varieties in pure stand. The analysis highlighted a significant global overyielding of 3.5%, which reached 6.2% in condition of high disease pressures. Overyielding was not affected by seeding density or plot size. Under high disease pressure, over yielding increased by 3.2% point per added component variety. Overyielding was respectively 5.3% and 3.3% higher for mixtures heterogeneous in disease resistance or phenology than for homogeneous ones, and did not vary when considering height. Overyielding reached its highest values in the 19805 and 19905, which reflects the predominance of disease-focused studies during this period. Our results confirm that cultivar mixtures are a potential way to increase yield relatively to pure varieties, especially under low pesticide cropping systems. Literature suggests that mixture practice is impeded by the lack of general rules that could help to mixing varieties. To design such rules it is needed to (1) achieve new experiments manipulating the heterogeneity in variety traits, (2) determine experimentally the ecological mechanisms underlying mixture performance and (3) develop new models allowing testing and analyzing these mechanisms.

The planted leguminous species were Pueraria phaseoloides, Senna siilnrrir, Leucaena leucocephala,, Acacia leptocarpa and A. auriculiformis. plots with natural fallow and maize/cassava intercropping were included. Level (minimum) and mound tillage with hoes was adopted for the cultivated areas under study after 4 and 6 year fallow periods. Under fallow, the soil bulk density decreased from 1.56 to 1.11 t m(-3). The continuously cropped treatment (level tillage) had significantly higher bulk density than the fallowed subplots after 6 years. Mean soil penetrometer resistance ranged from 75 to 157 kPa for fallowed plots and from 192 to 295 kPa for the continuously cropped (level tillage) subplot. Surface soil water contents were similar for all the treatments during the soil strength measurements. Although soil aggregates were generally of low stability and not well formed, they were improved by fallowing. Soil structural improvement by planted fallows was similar to that by natural fallow, but the trees were more promising for long-term fallow (>6 years) than the herbaceous P. phaseoloides. However, the improvement in soil structure after 4 or 6 rear falloff could not be maintained in subsequent cropping. Furthermore, the significant improvement in soil bulk density caused by A. auriculiformis and natural fallow was more rapidly lost on the cultivated subplots compared with other fallow treatments. Thus, soil structure recovery under a fallow does not imply a sustained improvement when stress is applied to this soil. Post-fallow soil management options such as residue incorporation and tillage to ameliorate compaction or soil strength mill be necessary to enhance the improvements by fallow species.

Radiation Dynamics on Crop Productivity in Different Cropping Systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Review							"DRY-MATTER PRODUCTION; LEAF-AREA INDEX; USE EFFICIENCY; LIGHT INTERCEPTION; INTERCROPPING SYSTEMS; MAIZE; WHEAT; GROWTH; YIELD; COMPONENTS"	Global demand for food has always been on the increase due to the increase of the population in this world. Intercropping is one of the alternatives of agronomic practices that is widely practiced in ensuring food security and enhancing yield stability. Strip, mixed, and relay intercropping can be practiced to increase crop production. In addition to achieving a successful intercropping system, factors such as suitable crops, time of sowing, maturity of the crop, and plant density need to be considered before and during planting. Besides, practiced intercropping becomes a useful cropping system to increase efficient resource utilization, enhance biodiversity, promote soil health, enhance soil fertility, erosion control, yield advantage, weed, pest, and disease control, insurance against crop failure, ecosystem and modification of microclimate, market instability, and increase farmers income. Crop productivity in any types of cropping system implemented relies primarily on the interception of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) of crop canopy and conversion of intercepted radiation into biomass or known as radiation use efficiency (RUE). Both PAR and RUE are important measurements that have significant roles in crop growth and development in which the accessibility of these radiation dynamics is connected with the leaf area index and crop canopy characteristics in maximizing yield as well as total productivity of the crop component in intercropping systems.

Adjustments in the water management practices-in terms of source and amount of freshwater inputs-have resulted in changes in the diversity, distribution and productivity of submerged angiosperms. Between the 1970s and late 1980s, a massive decline of the aquatic vegetation occurred in the Encanyissada-Clot and Tancada lagoons, but little information on the status is available after the recovery of macrophytes in the 1990s. Here, we evaluate the influence of salinity regimes resulting from current water management practices on the composition, distribution, seasonal abundance and flowering rates of submersed macrophytes, as well as on the occurrence of epiphyte and drift macroalgae blooms in three coastal lagoons. Our results show that Ruppia cirrhosa is the dominant species in the Encanyissada lagoon (185.97 +/- 29.74 g DW m(-2) year(-1); 12-27 aEuro degrees salinity) and the only plant species found in the Tancada lagoon (53.26 +/- 10.94 g DW m(2) year(-1); 16-28 aEuro degrees salinity). Flowering of R. cirrhosa (up to 1,011 +/- 121 flowers m(-2)) was only observed within the Encanyissada and suggests that mesohaline summer conditions may favor these events. In contrast, low salinities in Clot lagoon (similar to 3-12 aEuro degrees) favor the development of Potamogeton pectinatus (130.53 +/- 13.79 g DW m(2) year(-1)) with intersperse R. cirrhosa (8.58 +/- 1.71 g DW m(-2)) and mixed stands of P. pectinatus and Najas marina (up to similar to 57 g DW m(-2) year(-1)) in some reduced areas. The peak biomasses observed during the study are 88 to 95 % lower than maximum values reported in the literature at similar salinities, and there is also little or no recovery in some areas compared to last reports more than 20 years ago. The main management actions to restore the natural diversity and productivity of submersed angiosperms, such as the recovering of the seagrass Zostera noltii, should be the increase of salinity during the period of rice cultivation, by reducing freshwater inputs and increasing flushing connections with the bays."

However, quantitative data to evaluate plant growth in intercropping systems are still lacking. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have the potential to become a state-of-the-art technique for the automatic estimation of plant growth. Individual plant height is an important trait attribute for field investigation as it can be used to derive information on crop growth throughout the growing season. This study aimed to investigate the applicability of UAV-based RGB imagery combined with the structure from motion (SfM) method for estimating the individual plants height of cabbage, pumpkin, barley, and wheat in an intercropping field during a complete growing season under varying conditions. Additionally, the effect of different percentiles and buffer sizes on the relationship between UAV-estimated plant height and ground truth plant height was examined. A crop height model (CHM) was calculated as the difference between the digital surface model (DSM) and the digital terrain model (DTM). The results showed that the overall correlation coefficient (R-2) values of UAV-estimated and ground truth individual plant heights for cabbage, pumpkin, barley, and wheat were 0.86, 0.94, 0.36, and 0.49, respectively, with overall root mean square error (RMSE) values of 6.75 cm, 6.99 cm, 14.16 cm, and 22.04 cm, respectively. More detailed analysis was performed up to the individual plant level. This study suggests that UAV imagery can provide a reliable and automatic assessment of individual plant heights for cabbage and pumpkin plants in intercropping but cannot be considered yet as an alternative approach for barley and wheat.

The intercropping systems were assessed on the basis of existing competition and economic indices such as land equivalent ratio (LER), relative crowding coefficient (K), aggressivity (A), competitive ratio (CR), actual yield loss (AYL), intercropping advantage and monetary advantage index (MAI). Yields of individual vegetables were higher when grown as sole crops compared with their intercropping with pea. Harvest index for pea was higher when grown alone or intercropped with garlic and was significantly reduced when intercropped with turnip or cauliflower. Harvest indices for garlic, turnip and cauliflower were statistically similar when grown as sole crops or intercropped with pea. The partial LER, K, A and CR for pea were higher in pea-garlic intercropping. However, partial LER, K, A and CR for intercrop were significantly higher for cauliflower and turnip in pea-cauliflower and pea-turnip intercropping systems respectively. The product of relative K values was greater for pea-garlic intercropping system, indicating a definite yield advantage. A similar trend to LER was followed by AYL. These results indicate that pea was more competitive than garlic, and cauliflower and turnip were more competitive than pea for exploiting the available growth resources. The highest MAI value was recorded for pea-garlic intercropping, reflecting that this intercropping system was more advantageous compared with other intercropping systems, indicating definite yield and economic advantages. However, pea-cauliflower intercropping system resulted in higher net income and benefit cost ratio.

The sole crops were grown at 25, 50, 75, 100 and 150 % of the recommended density (RD) for conventionally grown crops. The intercrops consisted of all density combinations of wheat and beans from 25 to 100 % RD in a factorial experiment. The grain yield of sole cropped wheat and beans increased significantly as their density was increased. The highest yield of both was achieved at 100 % RD, indicating that the conventional recommendation was the optimum when applied to organically grown crops. Land equivalent ratio (LER) values for the intercrops were significantly greater than 1.0 when the wheat was sown at > 5 % RD and beans at > 50 % RD. The highest LER of 1.29 was achieved when wheat and beans were both sown at 75 % RD. There was resource complementarity, expressed as relative yield total (RYT) > 1.0, in all of the density combinations. There was a significant decrease in resource complementarity with increasing wheat and bean density. The nitrogen content of the wheat grain and whole plant biomass was significantly increased when the density of beans in the intercrops was increased; this was reflected in a significant increase in grain protein at harvest. The total amount of N accumulated by the wheat, however, decreased with increasing bean density due to a reduction in the biomass of wheat. Beans also showed a significant increase in %N as the density of the other component increased and a decrease in total N accumulation due to reduced biomass. All of the intercrops accumulated more N than the sole cropped wheat, but did not exceed that accumulated by sole-cropped beans. The biomass of weeds was greater under beans than under wheat. Weed biomass in intercrops was significantly reduced when the density of wheat and brans was increased, resulting in a lower weed biomass in the intercrops than was achieved in either the sole cropped wheat or beans. The N content of weeds was significantly reduced with increasing wheat density but was significantly increased with increasing bean density. The total amount of N accumulated by weeds per unit area was reduced significantly by increasing the density of both components. The levels of disease on the wheat were low, but mildew (Erysiphe graminis) increased significantly as bean density increased. The incidence of chocolate spot (Botrytis fabae) increased significantly with increased bean density. The experiment demonstrated that it was possible to harvest the crop with a combine harvester and the wheat and beans can be planted separately mechanically, therefore this system is suited to mechanized agricultural systems."

Isolations were made from a range of spring barley monocultures and mixtures in a field trial, and characterised for virulence and RAPD profile. In a second trial, isolates were taken from a single mixture from untreated and resistance elicitor-treated areas and from the components of the mixture in monoculture. The mildew population was not only highly heterogeneous for virulence characteristics, but also proved heterogeneous within pathotypes for molecular markers, indicating the major impact of sexual recombination on population structure and the lack of clonal dominance. Various diversity measurements were compared and the value of dissimilarity measurement for revealing genetic distance within a population was highlighted. There was a trend towards increasing complexity as the season progressed, but there was no consistent relationship between cultivar or mixture, disease control treatment, fertiliser treatment, replicate or position in trial, and pathogen genotype. Whilst the resistance elicitor did reduce mildew by 78% in the first trial, and there was no interaction with fertiliser level in its expression, control was substantially less in the second trial. There were no differences between mildew isolates from elicitor and control treatments. It was felt that more effective and consistent resistance elicitors need to be developed before it can be stated that they are unlikely to be eroded by selecting resistant or adapted mildew genotypes.

However, the relationships between these factors are both site- and scale-specific. In hilly areas of south-western China, the dominant cropping systems are rice, vegetables, oranges, Chinese red pepper and maize-sweet potato intercropping. In the present study, slope position (valley, low slope, flat slope, middle slope, upper slope, ridge) and aspect (north, east, south, west) were derived to investigate the relationships among cropping system, terrain, and soil nutrients at county scale. Crops were mainly planted at middle or flat slope positions. Rice and orange plants were evenly distributed across the aspects whereas vegetables were mostly planted on the northern aspect. Red pepper and maize-sweet potato plants were mainly grown on the western and southern aspects. Rice sites had higher contents of organic matter and available nitrogen (N) and lower contents of available phosphorus (P) and available potassium (K). For dryland cropping systems, vegetable sites had higher contents of organic matter, available N, and available P. Red pepper sites had higher contents of available K. Contents of organic matter and available N were generally higher at lower landscape positions. Contents of available K were higher at lower and flat slope positions. Contents of available P were higher at higher landscape positions. Contents of organic matter and available N were higher on the northern and eastern, and lower on the western aspects. Contents of available P were higher on the western and lower on the northern aspects. No significant differences were found for available K across the aspects. Classification tree algorithms indicated that relative importance of the variables on soil nutrient variation was in the order: (i) cropping system, (ii) slope position, and (iii) aspect.

The soil at the experimental site was a Kanhaplic Haplustalf, which was under continuous cultivation with arable crops for seven years and fallow for four years. The effects of organic and inorganic fertilizers were investigated singly and in combination. The type of fertilizer had no significant effect on the soil pH, although, cropping significantly lowered the pH from 6.0 to 5.7. Cropping also significantly reduced the soil organic matter and total nitrogen (N). The soil organic matter (OM) and total N were most depleted with organic fertilizer application. Complementary application of organic and inorganic fertilizers limited the degree of depletion from 31.0 to 12.1 g kg(-1) of OM and 1.8 to 0.6 g kg(-1) total N. Soil available P was increased (60%) by inorganic fertilizer while the organic fertilizer increased it by 145% and the combined fertilizer by 186%.

Although intercropping improves soil nutrients and crop productivity, its effects on the microbial-mediated belowground processes and main drivers remain unclear. Methods We performed the same field study at two sites (Site1, Youyu; Site2, Zhangbei) by growing soybean and oat in monoculture and intercropping to investigate their effects on rhizosphere soil properties, enzyme stoichiometry, and soil ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF). Results Intercropping increased available phosphorus (Avail-P) by 87% and 16% for oat and soybean compared to the corresponding monoculture in site1, respectively. We also found that intercropping increased the C-acquiring and N-acquiring enzyme activities by 18%-48% in site1. Moreover, intercropping enhanced soil EMF and alleviated microbial P limitations for both oat and soybean compared to the corresponding monoculture in site1. However, all observed parameters were not affected by intercropping in site2, which may be due to the lower Avail-P, mineral nitrogen (N-min), and precipitation in site2 compared to site1. Moreover, the soil EMF was strongly positively correlated with soil N-min, Avail-P, air temperature, and precipitation. Conclusion Therefore, intercropping improves soil ecosystem multifunctionality by increasing available nutrients, which are regulated by regional factors."

Presently available insecticides are unable to provide control over wireworm populations, and the use of natural enemies has not been successful under field conditions. In this study, we examined the effect of seven trap crops: pea, lentil, canola, corn, durum, barley, and wheat, for their attractiveness to wireworms compared to spring wheat. Experimental plots were located in two commercial grain fields in Valier and Ledger, Montana, USA and the trials took place from May to August in 2015 and 2016. Wheat plants damaged by wireworms were recorded and their relative locations in wheat rows and adjacent trap crop rows within a plot were determined using destructive soil samples. In 2016, variable row spacing (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 m) between the trap crops (pea and lentil) and wheat was assessed. Shade house bioassays were conducted using potted pea, lentil, and wheat plants to support field trial results. Limonius californicus larvae, released at the center of each pot were sampled 4 and 10 days after sowing. Wheat intercropped with pea and lentil had significantly fewer damaged wheat plants. Wireworm numbers were lower in wheat intercropped with pea compared to the control for both locations and years. Shade house results corresponded with field results, with more wireworms collected from pea and lentil than wheat. In the spacing trials, wheat plant counts were also significantly higher when paired with pea and lentil, particularly at 0.5 m spacing. Regardless of inter-row spacing, significantly fewer wireworms were associated with wheat when intercropped with pea and lentil trap crops.	"[Adhikari, Ashish; Reddy, Gadi V.

Soil survey was conducted at four different locations of Guangxi, China to investigate the effect of peanut and soybean inter-cropping in sugarcane cultivation on the soil properties and diazotrophic bacterial diversity. Principal component analysis result shown (PCA) showed difference impact of intercropping and monoculture on the basis of biological and chemical properties of soil. Two-way analysis of variance of soil properties showed a significant interactive effect with locations and cultivation systems. Microbial enumeration results demonstrated that intercropping system enhanced the diazotrophic population. After isolation of diazotrophs, 21 selected bacteria were characterized by siderophore, phosphate, indole acetic acid, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase and nitrogenase assay. Among the identified bacteria, isolate MYSP104 showed maximum nitrogenase activity and isolate MYSS78 showed maximum ACC deaminase activity. Partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing results classified these diazotrophs in six phyla (Firmicutes, alpha, beta,gamma-proteobacteria, actinobacteria and bacteroidetes). Diazotrophs such as Bacillus tequilensis, Variovorax paradoxus, Acidovorax facilis, Leucobacter aridicollis, Streptomyces fimicarius and Pseudomonas nitroreducens were reported for the first time from the sugarcane rhizosphere of Guangxi, China. Venn diagram explained that seven bacterial species (Brevibacterium, Burkholderia, Delftia, Leucobacter, Pseudomonas, Sinorhizobium and Variovorax) were recognized with soybean and sugarcane intercropping cultivation systems. This study concluded that intercropping system could enhance the population of N-fixers in soil. Soybean intercropping influenced the soil chemical and biological properties better than peanut. Moreover, the isolated diazotrophs need further characterization and they might be utilized as bio-inoculums for commercial sugarcane production in the future.

Bacterial and fungal core microbiomes associated with small grain silages during ensiling and aerobic spoilage	BMC MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						"Barley; Oats; Triticale; Silage; Microbiome; Bacteria; Fungi; Aerobic exposure"	"RNA GENE DATABASE; NUTRITIVE-VALUE; LISTERIA-MONOCYTOGENES; FOOD SAFETY; BARLEY; FERMENTATION; COMMUNITIES; STABILITY; ACID; PHYLLOSPHERE"	Background: Describing the microbial populations present in small grain silage and understanding their changes during ensiling is of interest for improving the nutrient value of these important forage crops. Barley, oat and triticale forages as well as an intercropped mixture of the 3 crops were harvested and ensiled in mini silos for a period of 90 days, followed by 14 days of aerobic exposure. Changes in fermentation characteristics and nutritive value were assessed in terminal silages and bacterial and fungal communities during ensiling and aerobic exposure were described using 16S and 18S rDNA sequencing, respectively. Results: All small grain silages exhibited chemical traits that were associated with well ensiled forages, such as low pH value (4.09 +/- 0.28) and high levels of lactic acid (59.8 +/- 14.59 mg/g DM). The number of microbial core genome operational taxonomic units (OTUs) decreased with time of ensiling. Taxonomic bacterial community profiles were dominated by the Lactobacillales after fermentation, with a notable increase in Bacillales as a result of aerobic exposure. Diversity of the fungal core microbiome was shown to also be reduced during ensiling. Operational taxonomic units assigned to filamentous fungi were found in the core microbiome at ensiling and after aerobic exposure, whereas the Saccharomycetales were the dominate yeast population after 90 days of ensiling and aerobic exposure. Bacterial and fungal orders typically associated with silage spoilage were identified in the core microbiome after aerobic exposure. Conclusion: Next Generation Sequencing was successfully used to describe bacterial communities and the first record of fungal communities throughout the process of ensiling and utilization. Adequately describing the microbial ecology of silages could lead to improved ensiling practices and the selection of silage inoculants that act synergistically with the natural forage microbiome.

Two experiments were performed in central Italy with durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) and field bean (Vicia faba L. var. minor) grown for forage production in IC and as sole crops (SC) with different N rates (20 and 50 kg ha-1) and row ratios (1:1 and 2:1 cereal/legume). The aims were to assess (i) whether IC is a feasible option to reduce N fertilization; (ii) the best combination of practices to obtain forage suitable for ensiling; and (iii) competition/facilitation effects exerted by field bean on durum wheat. Results showed IC allowed fertilizer-N reduction and led to improved forage yield with better quality, compared with SC. Land equivalent ratio indicated a high efficiency of the IC, by up to 26% with respect to SC. Field bean was the dominant species of IC, but N fertilization reduced its competitive ability and enhanced that of wheat. In the intercrop fertilized with 50 kg N ha-1, the proportion of the wheat in the herbage (0.34-0.41 of the total dry matter) was sufficient for ensiling of the forage mass. Field bean exerted both competition and facilitation effects on the cereal. N uptake of durum wheat was greater under IC with beans than as wheat SC."

Effect of subsoiling	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Cajanus cajan; competition; energy use efficiency; Glycine max; intercropping; root length density; subsoiling"	"SOIL-WATER CONTENT; DEEP-TILLAGE; ROOT-GROWTH; CONSERVATION TILLAGE; CROP PRODUCTION; CLAY SOIL; ZEA-MAYS; COTTON; ROTATION; BARLEY"	Opinions differ on the necessity of deep tillage for sustaining crop productivity in the rainfed Vertisols of the semi-arid tropics of central India. We conducted a field experiment for 3 years (2000-2002) with a factorial combination of three cropping systems (sole soybean, sole pigeonpea and soybean/pigeonpea intercropping in 2:1 row ratio) and three tillage practices (conventional, conventional + subsoiling in alternate years and conventional + subsoiling every year). Objectives were (i) to examine the effect of subsoiling Vertisols on sustaining yield of soybean/pigeon pea intercropping, and (ii) to assess the frequency of subsoiling for realizing maximum yield and profit. Though there was a reduction in growth and yield of intercrops, higher soybean equivalent yield (SEY) and area-time equivalent ratio (ATER) value in soybean/ pigeonpea intercropping system as compared to sole soybean had a yield advantage. The average yield advantage in intercropping system was 60% higher than that from sole soybean. The yield advantage of intercropping system in terms of ATER was 7% greater with subsoiling than conventional tillage. The yield response to subsoiling was consistent over the period and on an average, subsoiling increased yield by 20%. The effect was associated with improved water storage and root length density. However, with respect to energy use efficiency and profit, the effect of subsoiling was comparable to conventional tillage. The variation in net return and benefit:cost ratio in subsoiling every year and subsoiling in alternate years in sole soybean and soybean/pigeonpea intercropping was not significant. However, in sole pigeon pea subsoiling every year out-yielded subsoiling in alternate years. The interactive effect of subsoiling and intercropping increased the yield by 21-25%. Thus, under tainted cropping where drought of unpredictable intensity and duration is a prevailing feature, soybean/pigeon pea intercropping could be a promising option, especially when combined with subsoiling in alternate years.

Experiments done in the controlled environment of a biotron were supplemented with four separate greenhouse experiments. Lupin and soybean were grown in monoculture and intercropped on a soil with low available P that was labeled with carrier-free P-32 as phosphate. Lupin had significantly lower values of specific activity of P-32 and higher values of isotopically exchangeable P than soybean in all cases.

The IFS enhances nutrient recycling and food security and promotes greater efficiency of fertilizers and natural resources. To improve livelihood, profits, and employment generation holistically through an IFS method, a study was conducted over four years, from 2016 to 2019, to define the farming condition in 1036 households in the Muzzafarnagar district of Western Uttar Pradesh. Crop + dairy was the most frequent farming method (68%) followed by crop + dairy + horticulture + goatary. Compared to older cultivars, improved rice, maize, wheat, and barley cultivars enhanced crop yield by 17 to 42%. Transplanting sugarcane and intercropping of mustard increased system yield from 58.89% to 86.17% compared to the sole sugarcane crop. Nutritional kitchen gardening resulted in an average saving of $20 to $25 during the Kharif season and $20 to $27 during Rabi season. Exotic vegetables such as broccoli, Chinese cabbage, cherry tomato, kale, parsley, and lettuce were introduced, which increased regular income. With the adoption of a multi-tier-based system, the net returns from the system improved from 0.6 lakh to 2.20 lakhs per ha. Enhancing the fodder availability resulted in a 27.5% milk yield improvement. The study's outcomes demonstrated that a five-member family's annual protein (110-125 kg) and carbohydrate (550 to 575 kg) requirements can be easily met using the IFS technique. According to the study, IFS approaches combined with better technical interventions can ensure the long-term viability of farming systems and improve livelihoods.

Sunflower-Soybean Intercrop Productivity under Different Water Conditions and Sowing Managements	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							"COMPONENT CROPS; GROWTH-STAGES; YIELD; MAIZE; RADIATION; AGRICULTURE"	The sunflower (Helianthus annus L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] intercrop has emerged as an option that increases land productivity in the southern Pampas of Argentina, compared with sole crops, because of complementary use of resources between species. A common management practice for this intercrop consists of delay soybean sowing, although delayed planting reduces the capacity of soybean to capture resources. Simultaneous sowing could improve total intercrop productivity because of an increase in soybean grain yield with no or little detrimental effects on sunflower grain yield. The objectives of this study were to analyze the response of the sunflower-soybean intercrop and of their component species under different sowing management (i.e., relay or simultaneous sowing) and water availability conditions. Three experiments were conducted at Balcarce, Argentina. Four cropping systems were evaluated: (i) sunflower-soybean intercrop with simultaneous sowing management (I00), (ii) sunflower-soybean intercrop with 30 d of delay between sunflower and soybean sowing (I30), (iii) sunflower sole crop (SUN), and (iv) soybean sole crop (SOY). Sunflower-soybean intercrop grain yield tend to be higher than that for sole crops of the component species. This yield advantage for intercrop increased with water availability and was associated with an increase in intercropped soybean productivity. Intercrop sowing management had no effect on total intercrop grain yield. However, simultaneous sowing increased soybean contribution to intercrop yield. Finally, our results indicate that agronomic practices that promote intercropped soybean performance increase intercrop productivity relative to the sole crops of their component species.

The results showed that root interaction and increasing nitrogen application increased the green leaf area per plant and chlorophyll content of soybean, but their effects gradually decreased with increasing nitrogen fertilization level. Root interaction and increasing nitrogen application can improve photosynthetic characteristics of soybean, but root interaction only had a significant effect under low nitrogen level. The number of bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes and Azotobacteria was also obviously affected by root interaction and nitrogen fertilization, and the number of Azotobacteria presented a changing trend of first increased and then decreased with increasing nitrogen fertilization level. Root interaction and increasing nitrogen application improved soybean yield and its components, but their effects gradually decreased with increasing nitrogen fertilization level. The root activity of soybean was obviously affected by root interaction, and was significantly positively correlated with green leaf area per plant, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate and economic yield per plant. Our results indicate that the advantage effect of root interaction and increasing nitrogen application will be partially inhibited with an increasing nitrogen fertilization level.

Cattle grazed a mixed stand of primarily big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) with some indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans [L.] Nash) from the 1st wk of June to the 3rd wk of August. In 1987, 72 yearling steers (286 kg) were allotted randomly to three treatments: energy control (cornstarch-molasses mixture) or energy control plus .1 or .2 kg.animal-1.d-1 of escape protein. The total amount of a supplement fed per day was 1 kg. In 1988, 90 yearling heifers (240 kg) were allotted to five treatments: negative control (no supplement), energy control, energy control plus .14 kg.animal-1.d-1 of escape protein, energy control plus .18 kg.animal-1.d-1 of ruminally degraded protein, or .36 kg.animal-1-d-1 of protein supplied by a combination of the two protein sources. The total amount of a supplement fed per day was 1.7 kg. During 1987, the .2-kg level of escape protein produced the greatest gains (P < .10). In 1988, gains did not differ between the control and escape protein treatments. Ruminally degraded protein tended (P = .12) to increase gains (.09 kg/d) compared with the energy control. The combination treatment supported .13 kg/d more ADG (P < .10) than the negative and energy controls and the escape protein treatment. Ruminal ammonia concentrations in unsupplemented steers were low, with few values > 5 mg/dL. Based on in situ measurements, 42 to 5.4% of the forage protein escaped ruminal degradation. Response to ruminally degraded protein, low ruminal ammonia concentrations, and moderate in situ forage protein degradation indicated that ruminally degraded protein was needed for maximum forage digestion.

The measured yield and yield components were pod length, seed per pod, pods mass at harvest, grain yield and field biomass yield. Cowpea planted on monocropping and rotational systems had significantly (P < 0.05) higher seed number per pod at harvest, grain yield and field biomass yield than cowpea planted on intercropping. The interaction of location x season plays a vital role on cowpea production by increasing yield. A single cultivar might differ significantly across different locations due to different soil types and climatic factors.

In this experiment, six rotations (R1-R6) were considered, basically consisting on the same crop sequence with different starting points, i.e. (1) legume crop (soybean/field bean/common pea), (2) vegetable crop (pepper/melon), (3) winter cereal (soft/durum wheat), (4) summer cereal (maize) (5) industrial vegetable (processing tomato), (6) winter cereal (soft/durum wheat). All rotations were established both in ORG and in CONV, in strict adherence to EU regulations (ORG: EU reg. 2092/91; CONV: EU reg. 2078/92). Intercrops with green manuring purposes were included in ORG, while weed control was performed mechanically in ORG and chemically/mechanically in CONV. Weed seedbank was determined on 10 soil samples (0-0.30 m depth) in each plot and seeds were directly extracted, identified and counted. In all rotations, the adoption of ORG resulted in a significant increase in weed seedbank density, particularly in the case of summer weed species (Portulaca oleracea L., Amaranth us retroflexus L. and Chenopodium album L.), which are more competitive and difficult to control in summer crops under organic farming systems in the Mediterranean climates. Small differences between ORG and CONV were found in terms of number of weed species (23 in ORG and 20 in CONV, on average), but the index of diversity in CONV was on average higher than in ORG. Furthermore, the most dominant weeds in CONV represented a lower percentage of total seedbank (40%, 23% and 5%, respectively, for P. oleracea, A. retroflexus and C. album in CONV and 56%, 32% and 4% for the same three weeds in ORG). These results confirm that the wider availability of effective weed control methods in integrated low-input farming systems (CONV) is helpful to maintain a low seedbank size, with a lower dominance structure. However, the adoption of ORG systems based on long rotation cycles, very competitive crops and accurate weed control, especially at the beginning of the ORG management, may be sustainable in the long run, in terms of potential weed infestation levels.

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of seeding patterns (mixed, alternative and cross-seeding patterns), nitrogen (0, 60, and 120 kg N ha(-1)) and phosphorus fertilizer (0, 40, 80 and 120 kg P2O5 ha(-1)) rates on dry matter yields, botanical composition and crude protein yield of lucerne-smooth bromegrass mixture in an intercropping system. The experiment was established in 2001 and data were collected in dry matter yield and legume ratio for four years (2002-2005) and in crude protein yield for two years (2002-2003). The results showed that the highest dry matter yield was produced by a alternative seeding pattern. However, the highest legume ratio and crude protein yield was produced by mixtures sown in cross seeding pattern. Nitrogen fertilizer application decreased legume ratio but increased crude protein yield. Phosphorus fertilizer application had no effect on dry matter yield, legume ratio or crude protein yield of the lucerne-smooth bromegrass mixtures.

Reuniting the Three Sisters: collaborative science with Native growers to improve soil and community health	AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES			English	"Article; Early Access"						"3 Sisters; Food sovereignty; Intercropping; Indigenous agriculture; Milpa; Native american; Niche complementarity; Rematriation; Seed sovereignty; Traditional ecological knowledge"	"MICROBIAL BIOMASS NITROGEN; LAND EQUIVALENT RATIO; EXTRACTION METHOD; SUSTAINABLE INTENSIFICATION; DIETARY DIVERSITY; WESTERN HIGHLANDS; WATER-QUALITY; AGRICULTURE; COMPLEMENTARITY; PRODUCTIVITY"	Before Euro-American settlement, many Native American nations intercropped maize (Zea mays), beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), and squash (Cucurbita pepo) in what is colloquially called the Three Sisters. Here we review the historic importance and consequences of rejuvenation of Three Sisters intercropping (3SI), outline a framework to engage Native growers in community science with positive feedbacks to university research, and present preliminary findings from ethnography and a randomized, replicated 3SI experiment. We developed mutually beneficial collaborative research agendas with four Midwestern US Native American nations. Ethnographic data highlighted a culturally based respect for 3SI as living beings, the importance it holds for all cultural facets of these Native nations, and the critical impact the practice has on environmental sustainability. One concern expressed by Native growers during ethnographic research was improving soil health-part of the rationale for establishing the 3SI agronomic experiment. To address this, we collaboratively designed a 3SI experiment. After 1 year, 3SI increased short-term soil respiration by 24%, decreased salt-extractable nitrate by 54%, had no effect on soil microbial biomass (but increased its carbon-to-nitrogen ratio by 32%) compared to the average of monoculture crops. The overarching purpose of this collaborative project is to develop a deeper understanding of 3SI, its cultural importance to Native communities, and how reinvigorating the practice-and intercropping in general-can make agroecosystems more sustainable for people and the environment.

A bio-economic evaluation of the profitability of adopting subtropical grasses and pasture-cropping on crop-livestock farms	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						"Intercropping; Pasture-cropping; Technology evaluation; MIDAS; Model of dryland agricultural system; Whole farm modelling"	"NEW-SOUTH-WALES; WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; GRAZE PROGRAM; SYSTEMS; LUCERNE; WHEAT; WATER; SOIL; IMPROVE; YIELDS"	"Pasture-cropping is a novel approach to increasing the area of perennial forages in mixed livestock and cropping systems. It involves planting annual cereals directly into a living perennial pasture. There is interest in using subtropical grasses for pasture-cropping as they are winter dormant and their growth profile is complementary with winter crops. The ability of subtropical grasses to maintain feed quality in summer is likely to be an important attribute. However, a wide range of factors can affect the uptake of such systems. This paper evaluates the farm-system economics of subtropical grasses and pasture-cropping. The research question is: what factors affect the profitability of a new technology such as (1) subtropical grass and (2) subtropical grass that is pasture-cropped. The analysis uses the MIDAS model of a central wheatbelt farm in Western Australia. The results suggest the profitability and adoption of subtropical grasses is likely to be strongly influenced by the mix of soil types present on the farm; the feed quality of the subtropical grass; whether the production emphasis of the farm is for grazing or cropping, and the level of production in summer and early autumn. The same factors are relevant to pasture-cropping, with the addition of yield penalties due to competition between the arable crop and the host perennial. The results were less sensitive to changes in the winter production of subtropical grass. Pasture-cropping was more profitable and likely to involve a larger area of the farm when a meat rather than a wool-dominant sheep system was present. However, there was little difference between the meat and wool flocks in their sensitivity to other factors in this analysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."	"[Finlayson, J.

Merrill)	INTERNATIONAL AGROPHYSICS			English	Article						"stalk lodging; borer damage; planting densities; planting geometry; soybean"	"SORGHUM; LEGUMES; MAIZE"	Cultural practices which increase the amount of insect pressure can also increase the amount of lodging that occurs in the corn crop. Studies were therefore carried out, in the late cropping seasons of 2002 and 2003, on the effect of corn planting densities and geometry with soybean on corn lodging and infestations by stem borers. Treatments comprised three corn population densities of 40 000, 60 000 and 80 000 plants ha(-1) and three geometrical arrangements of corn-soybean mixtures of 1: 1, 1:2 and 1:3, in all possible combinations. There were also three sole crop populations of corn and one of soybean. This resulted in 13 treatments which were laid out in field plots in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications. Results of the studies showed that increasing corn population significantly (P < 0.05) increased corn-stalk lodging and plant height, but significantly reduced the stalk diameter, shoot dry weight and infestations and damage by borers on corn, as well as the grain yields of corn and soybean. This is such that plants at 80 000 stands ha(-1) recorded the highest amount of lodged stalks and the tallest plants, but the least stalk girth, shoot dry weight, infestation and damage by corn borers. The lowest grain yield was also obtained at this density. Differences in geometrical arrangements of corn-soybean and its interaction effects with planting density among these parameters did not attain any level of statistical significance. Similarly, the effect of intercropping corn with soybean did not produce any significant result on corn with respect to these parameters. These results are discussed in the light of corn planting densities and geometric arrangements with soybean, on corn production.

In this study, we used a cross-sectional survey method. Data were collected from 365 sampled households in eastern Ethiopia to identify different climate change adaptation strategies and the associated factors in response to food insecurity. Three-stage probit model was employed for data analysis. Three adaptation strategies, namely: adoption of improved varieties, irrigation usage and intercropping were identified. The study result shows that Shantam, an improved potato variety, is the most widely grown in the study area. Frost, known as wurchi/ amadey by its local name, was found to be the worst types of climate change incidence that severely affects potato production in the study area. The analysis of sociodemographic variables showed mixed results on each of the three adaptation strategies. Moreover, the regression revealed paradoxical results whereby irrigation usage and intercropping as climate change adaptation strategies recede the adoption of improved potato varieties.

Different wheat intercropping systems with tomato to alleviate chilling stress, increase yield and profitability	ANNALS OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						"Competition relationships; Intercropping; Net return; Productivity per unit area; Low-temperature stress; Tomato-wheat"	"LYCOPERSICON-ESCULENTUM; TEMPERATURE; GROWTH; PRODUCTIVITY; FRUITS; SEASON"	"Chilling temperature stress is the largest factor affecting tomato performance. Under these conditions, tomato cultivations require protection from cold and frost waves. A field study was conducted to investigate the effect of three wheat sowing dates (November 1st; November 15th and December 1st), and three wheat seeding rates of 25, 37.5, and 50 % of the normal seeding rate (142.8 kg seeds/ha) on the following aspects: yield and yield components of both crops, land equivalent ratio (LER), area time equivalent ratio (ATER), and economic return. The results revealed that intercropping wheat with tomato in mid-November, coupled with a 50 % seeding rate, produced the highest values of fruit setting (%), yield components, and total fruit yield/ha of tomato during both seasons. The climatic conditions prevailing on November 15th favored the increase of grain, straw yield/ha, and yield components compared to the other sowing dates. The density of the wheat seeding rate at 50 % produced the highest grain and straw yield/ha. In addition, intercropping wheat with tomato at a 50 % seeding rate on November 15th led to the highest values of LER (1.77 and 1.80) and ATER (1.35 and 1.36) and increased the net return by 106.6 and 112.0 % compared to the sole tomato cultivation in 1st and 2nd seasons, respectively.

MERR) INTERCROPPING INTO RHODESGRASS (CHLORIS GAYANA KUNTH.) ON DRY MATTER YIELD, CRUDE PROTEIN, AND SILAGE CHARACTERISTICS GROWN IN SOUTHWEST JAPAN	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES-JAPS			English	Article						"intercropping system; rhodesgrass; silage characteristic; soybean"	ACID	This study aimed to investigate the quantify yield and silage quality response of forage soybean (Glycine max L. Merr) intercropping into rhodesgrass (Chloris gayana Kunth.) cultivation compare to monoculture rhodesgrass in warm temperate zone. Rhodesgrass and soybean were intercropped in 2017 and 2018 at Sumiyoshi Livestock Science Station, University of Miyazaki in southwest Japan. As the results, there were no differences between the height of monocultured rhodesgrass (MC) and intercropped rhodesgrass (IC). Height of soybean was less than rhodesgrass. Dry matter yield (DMY) was not significantly different between MC and IC in both years. For soybean ratio of intercropped total yield, the two-years-average was 18.3%. The lower soybean ratio of intercropped total yield in 2018 (13.3%) than those in 2017 (30.8%) seems to be caused by the larger rhodesgrass DMY. Crude protein (CP) content of IC (11.0%) was not significantly higher than that of MC (10.6%). There was no significant difference of CP yield between MC (28.3 kg/10 a) and IC (22.3 kg/10 a). All silages produced in this two-year experiment had only trace amounts of organic acids and volatile basic nitrogen regardless of the presence of soybean. In conclusion, the existence of soybean did not affect the silage quality. Early growth type soybean cultivar, appreciate harvesting time and fertilizer improvement might be increase DMY and CP with soybean intercropping.	"[Prasojo, Y.

Strip intercropping, that is, diversifying cropland by growing strips of different crops using conventional machinery, may be a viable strategy to promote natural predator diversity and associated biological pest control in such conventional farming systems. We tested the influence of strip intercropping of conventionally managed winter wheat with oilseed rape, using common machinery with 27-36 m broad strips, on arthropod predator diversity and biological pest control. We characterized spider and carabid beetle communities, calculated pest aphid and pollen beetle densities and recorded parasitism rates for both crops (number of mummified aphids on wheat and number of parasitized pollen beetle larvae on oilseed rape). We observed a significant reduction in the densities of wheat aphids (50% decrease) and pollen beetle larvae (20% decrease) in strip intercropping areas compared to monocultures. Parasitism rates of wheat aphids increased significantly from 10% in monocultures to 25% in strip intercropping areas. The number of parasitized pollen beetle larvae did not show the same pattern but was higher towards the centre of the oilseed rape strip. Overall, the composition of predator communities benefited from the close neighbourhood of the two crop species in the strips, as carabid beetles were more abundant in oilseed rape and spiders were more abundant in wheat fields. Overall, strip intercropping reduced the dominance of one predator group and allowed for an equal representation of both spiders and carabid beetles in the mixture. Synthesis and applications. Our study presents evidence of the benefits of adopting strip intercropping with relatively large strips (adapted to existing machinery) for natural predator diversity and biological pest control in a large-scale conventionally managed farm scenario. Wheat-oilseed rape strip intercropping reduced pest densities, increased parasitism of wheat aphids and promoted equal representation of natural predator groups well beyond the areas of monoculture. Overall, by reducing the area dedicated to only one crop, the implementation of strip intercropping adapted to mechanized agricultural scenarios can be used to increase crop heterogeneity at regional scales and enhance biodiversity and biological control, even in simplified landscapes dominated by large-scale conventional agriculture.

Optimal Planting Date of Kernza Intermediate Wheatgrass Intercropped with Red Clover	AGRONOMY-BASEL			English	Article						"intermediate wheatgrass; planting date; intercrop; red clover; perennial grains; dual-use forages"	"SEEDING RATE; GRAIN; YIELD; CEREALS; FOOD"	Intermediate wheatgrass (IWG) is a new perennial dual-use crop for grain and forage with growing interest among farmers. Intercropping IWG with red clover may increase yield and nutritive value through nitrogen transfer. IWG and red clover planting timing can affect grain and forage yield, and there has not been previous research on this management practice. At two locations (Arlington and Lancaster, WI, USA) a factorial experiment was established two years with two factors: (1) IWG planting date (August through October, and April) and (2) red clover planting season (in the fall with IWG or frost seeded in the next spring). Yield data were collected for two subsequent years. Grain yield was maximized at 515 kg ha(-1) and 423 kg ha(-1) at Arlington and Lancaster when planted by 26 August and 13 September, respectively. Planting date influenced grain yields in the first harvest year but not in the second. Seeding red clover in the spring increased IWG and red clover biomass compared to seeding it in the fall. In Wisconsin, planting IWG by early September at the latest and planting red clover in the spring is recommended to maximize grain yield.

NOV.; LAND-USE; PH; FERTILIZATION"	"The continuous cultivation with excessive application of agrochemicals has led to the deterioration of soils. Incorporating leguminous green manure (GM) was found to improve the physicochemical and biological properties of soils. However, the influence of GM soybean intercropping on the temporal distribution of bacterial communities in strongly acidic soils is less explored. In this study, a nine-month field trial of soybean intercropping was conducted in a deteriorated tea plantation. This was used to test the hypothesis that GM treatment ameliorates tea-cultivated environments through changing bacterial communities as well as edaphic properties. GM treatment was demonstrated to increase both functional and population diversity during all the months that were considered. An alteration of life strategies exhibited by bacterial communities in GM treatment was observed, which shifted from oligotrophy (Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and the candidate phylum WPS-2) to copiotrophy (Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria). This also contributed to the remarkable increase in metabolic potential of bacterial communities toward all six carbon source categories. The potentially versatile organic matter decomposers and/or plant growth-promoting bacteria, such as Burkholderiaceae, Chitinophagaceae, Sphingobacteriaceae, and Sphingomonadaceae bacteria, were identified as the most effective biomarkers in GM treatment. These bacterial groups showed strong correlation with soil pH; organic matter; and available K, Ca, and Mg. The increased diversity, metabolic potential, and copiotrophic taxa provided insight into the benefits brought by soybean intercropping, with enhanced community stability, facilitated nutrient cycling, and microbe-plant interactions in the strongly acidic tea plantation."

To investigate the feasibility and potential of intercropping hyperaccumulator plants with crops in cadmium (Cd)- and zinc (Zn)-contaminated soil, a pot experiment was conducted to examine plant growth and the contents of Cd and Zn in the soil following intercropping of wheat and Sedum plumbizincicola. Five treatments were examined: control (wheat monoculture: 36 seedlings per pot), and intercropping of wheat with different planting densities of S. plumbizincicola (3, 6, 9 and 15 seedlings per pot, respectively). Results showed a decrease in soil pH, and in soil and wheat contents of Cd and Zn with increasing planting density of S. plumbizincicola, while the removal rate of Cd and Zn increased. Meanwhile, excessive planting (15 seedlings per pot) inhibited wheat growth by 27.34% compared with the control, and overall, the optimal planting density was 9 seedlings per pot, resulting in effective remediation with only a moderate effect on wheat growth. These findings highlight the value of intercropping S. plumbizincicola with wheat as a means of improving remediation of soil contaminated with heavy metals (Cd and Zn). (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The Illumina MiSeq platform and the microarray GeoChip 5.0 were applied in this study to detect the abundance, diversity and structure of bacterial and fungal communities, and to link specific functional genes with soil microbial-mediated N-cycling processes under experimental practice. The results revealed the ?-diversity of bacterial communities to be relatively stable while the fungal ?-diversity increased over the years. Intercropped sugarcane on rhizosphere soils under reduced and conventional N input harbor different bacterial and fungal community structures. Specifically, fungal ?-diversity (e.g. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota) was found to be more sensitive to field practices while bacterial community (e.g. Bacteroidetes and Acidobacteria) changed moderately in abundance. Besides that, soil TN, AP, pH, and C/N ratio could explain the major variations in structure of soil microbial groups and in key functional genes. This study revealed the effect of N reduction and cropping patterns on functional traits based on both taxa and gene categories of microbial community, thereby improving understanding of structure-function relationships of microbial N-cycling processes in the different N input levels combined with cropping systems.

This research aimed to examine the effect of relay-planting peanut between rice rows of different patterns on yield of red rice in aerobic irrigation systems, by conducting a field experiment designed according to Split Plot design with two treatment factors, i.e. intercropping as main plots (T0= without; T1= intercropping with peanuts), and rice row patterns as sub-plots (P1= normal or single-row; P2= double-row; P3= triple-row). In T1, one row of peanut was relay-planted (additive series) between single, double, or triple rows of red rice plants three weeks after seeding red rice on raised-beds. Results indicated that additive intercropping with peanut significantly increased clump size, dry straw weight, filled panicle number, panicle length, total biomass, filled grain number, grain yield per clump, and harvest index, and reduced percentage of unfilled grains of red rice, while patterns of rice rows only affected dry straw weight, percentage of panicle number, and weight of 100 grains. However, there were significant interactions between the treatment factors on dry straw weight and percentage of panicle number, which under single-row, they were low in monocropping but high and no differences between row patterns in intercropping system.

Post generation of S. photeinocarpum (ungrafted, grafted on eggplant, potato, and tomato, respectively) were utilized to intercrop with two varieties of soybean in Cd-contaminated soil. Soybean monoculture was employed as a control. Consequently, intercropping with different post-grafting S. photeinocarpum generation, except for tomato rootstock grafts post-generation, could reduce soybean biomass and photosynthetic pigment content. Additionally, all S. photeinocarpum post-grafting generations had the capacity to reduce Cd content in soybean when intercropping, while tomato rootstock grafts post-generation exhibited an adequate ability to accumulate Cd in S. photeinocarpum compared to the ungrafted treatment. In particular, tomato rootstock grafts post-generation could effectively decrease Cd content in soybean organs by 14.09-62.13%, relative to soybean monoculture, but increased shoot Cd content and shoot Cd extraction of S. photeinocarpum by 10.33-13.49% and 10.38-12.03%, respectively, compared to the ungrafted treatment. Thus, tomato rootstock grafting may enhance the ability of post-grafting generation of S. photeinocarpum to remediate Cd-contaminated soil, and this grafting was able to reduce Cd accumulation in soybean.

However, the effects of sugarcane/peanut intercropping on soil quality need to be clarified. This study characterized the soil microbial community and the soil quality in sugarcane/peanut intercropping systems by the Illumina MiSeq platform. The results showed that the intercropping sugarcane (IS) system significantly increased the total N (TN), available N (AN), available P (AP), pH value, and acid phosphatase activity (ACP), but it had little effect on the total P (TP), total K (TK), available K (AK), organic matter (OM), urease activity, protease activity, catalase activity, and sucrase activity, compared with those in monocropping sugarcane (MS) and monocropping peanut (MP) systems. Both intercropping peanut (IP) and IS soils contained more bacteria and fungi than soils in the MP and MS fields, and the microbes identified were mainly Chloroflexi and Acidobacteria, respectively. Intercropping significantly increased the number of unique microbes in IS soils (68 genera), compared with the numbers in the IP (14), MS (17), and MP (16) systems. The redundancy analysis revealed that the abundances of culturable Acidobacteriaceae subgroup 1, nonculturable DA111, and culturable Acidobacteria were positively correlated with the measured soil quality in the intercropping system. Furthermore, the sugarcane/peanut intercropping significantly increased the economic benefit by 87.84% and 36.38%, as compared with that of the MP and MS, respectively. These results suggest that peanut and sugarcane intercropping increases the available N and P content by increasing the abundance of rhizospheric microbes, especially Acidobacteriaceae subgroup 1, DA111, and Acidobacteria.

We tested, in field trials over three consecutive seasons at two sites in India, an intercropping and biofertilization scheme to boost their yields under low-input conditions. Pigeon pea seedlings were raised during the dry season and transplanted row-wise into fields of finger millet, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (Pseudomonas) were added alone or in combination to both pigeon pea and finger millet. Our major findings are (i) effects of the biofertilizers were particularly pronounced at the site of low fertility; (ii) dual inoculation of AMF+PGPR to finger millet and pigeon pea crops showed increased grain yields more effectively than single inoculation; (iii) the combined grain yields of finger millet and pigeon pea in intercropping increased up to +128% due to the biofertilizer application; (iv) compared to direct sowing, the transplanting system of pigeon pea increased their average grain yield up to 267% across site, and the yield gains due to biofertilization and the transplanting system were additive.

The leaves of the cucumber plants under wheat intercropping (CW) showed higher chlorophyll content and lower intercellular CO2 concentration than in cucumber monocropping (CM). The CW also increased the leaf activity and expression of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase enzymes, but reduced the hydrogen peroxide and the superoxide anion in leaves. In intercropped cucumber leaves, increased the activities of enzymes [ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) and polyamine oxidase] and also the expression of Rubisco actives and transglutaminase were increased than cucumber grown in monoculture. Putrescine and spermidine contents were decreased more in CW than in CM. These results suggested that wheat intercropped with cucumber decreased the accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the cucumber leaves, which in turn improved the carbon assimilation and thereby, delayed the leaf senescence.

To determine the effect of tobacco-peanut (Nicotiana tabacum-Arachis hypogaea) relay intercropping on the microbial community structure in soil, we compared the effects of relay intercropping and continuous cropping on the soil bacteria community structure. Methods We collected soil samples from three different cropping patterns and analyzed microbial community structure and diversity using high-throughput sequencing technology. Result The number of operational taxonomic units (OTU) for bacterial species in the soil was maximal under continuous peanut cropping. At the phylum level, the main bacteria identified in soil were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria, which accounted for approximately 70% of the total. The proportions of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes increased, whereas the proportion of Proteobacteria decreased in soil with tobacco-peanut relay intercropping. Moreover, the proportions of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria among the soil bacteria further shifted over time with tobacco-peanut relay intercropping. At the genus level, the proportions of Bacillus and Lactococcus increased in soil with tobacco-peanut relay intercropping. Conclusion The community structure of soil bacteria differed considerably with tobacco-peanut relay intercropping from that detected under peanut continuous cropping, and the proportions of beneficial bacteria (the phyla Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, and the genera Bacillus and Lactococcus) increased while the proportion of potentially pathogenic bacteria (the genera Variibacter and Burkholderia) decreased. These results provide a basis for adopting tobacco-peanut relay intercropping to improve soil ecology and microorganisms, while making better use of limited cultivable land.

Among the suggested mechanisms for this bottom-up pest control, the disruptive crop hypothesis states that herbivores' abilities to locate and colonize their host plants are reduced by the presence of non-host plants. Under laboratory conditions, we evaluated how intercropping wheat and legumes modifies the behaviour of apterous cereal aphids, Sitobion avenae (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), in terms of host plant location and population growth. We compared two intercropping systems - soft winter wheat, Triticum aestivum L. (Poaceae), associated with winter pea, Pisum sativum L., or with white clover, Trifolium repens L. (both Fabaceae) - and sole stands of soft winter wheat. Aphids needed more time to locate their wheat host plant and then spent less time on wheat when it was intercropped with clover. At the population level, and accounting for host plant biomass, only intercropping wheat with clover significantly reduced aphid densities on wheat, as this was particularly disruptive to S. avenae behaviour and population growth. Our laboratory study points out that the species used as non-host plants and their density are important parameters that should be taken into account in field studies on intercropping systems.

Methods The root system of watermelon was separated into two halves and placed in separate pots for Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum(FON) inoculation and wheat intercropping. Responses of the watermelon rhizosphere bacterial community to wheat intercropping and FON inoculation were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. Results Wheat intercropping did not affect the diversity but altered the composition of rhizosphere bacterial community on both sides of watermelon roots. In watermelon monoculture, FON inoculation increased the diversity of the rhizosphere bacterial community and stimulated certain potentially plant beneficial bacteria. The effects of FON inoculation on the watermelon rhizosphere bacterial community diversity and composition in watermelon-wheat intercropping were weaker than those in watermelon monoculture. No contact between wheat and FON was required to decrease the disease index of Fusarium wilt.

Experiments were planned as containing three intercropping patterns in alternate rows and pure stands for individual crops with three replications at two locations. As a result of the study, sorghum was determined as clearly dominant crop in producing high yield. Therefore, decreasing sorghum plant seeding rate in mixture caused a decrease in total yield. But soybean presence in forage induced a significant increase in protein content of forage. As a result, the land equivalent ratio with intercrops was higher as compared to pure plants, especially in intercropping systems in which sorghum plant density was not reduced more than 66% of sole sorghum.

In this study, we intercropped tea (Camellia sinensis) cv. 'Su cha zao' and soybean (Glycine max) cv. 'Lamar' in a tea plantation. The chlorophyll content was higher in intercropped tea leaves than in monoculture, and the different phenotypic characteristics of intercropping and monoculture were correlated with chlorophyll and carotenoid content. Our analyses showed that soybean-tea intercropping not only alleviated cold damage, but also influenced tea plant growth. Furthermore, the soil ammonium nitrogen (N) in intercropping mode increased during soybean flowering and mature periods and was highest in the soybean flowering and podding period. Catechin levels in tea leaves significantly decreased, and the amino acid and soluble sugars increased, for intercropped compared with monoculture tea leaves. The analysis of soil fertility and tea leaf physiological indices also indicated that N fertiliser was significantly positively correlated with free amino acids in tea leaves. In conclusion, soybean-tea intercropping affected the effective N content in soil, especially ammonium N, and the formation of the main physicochemical composition of tea leaves, as well as tea taste and aroma. Thus, intercropping can sustainably improve nutrient management and increase crop yield and quality.

The objective of the present study is to fix the problem of cadmium-contaminated soil by a fenugreek-wheat intercropping system. A pot experiment was managed to investigate the effect of wheat-fenugreek intercropping on growth, antioxidant activities and cadmium accumulation characteristics of tested plants grown under four cadmium concentrations (0, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg soil). Intercropping of fenugreek with wheat significantly improved growth of both species as compared with monocropping plants. Meanwhile, the cadmium concentrations in the shoots and roots of wheat in the intercropping design were significantly (p <0.05) lower than those in the monoculture. Additionally, fenugreek-wheat intercropping can improve plant resistance to heavy metals by decreasing the oxidative damage and increasing the antioxidant activities.

Productivity and water use of organic wheat-chickpea intercropping system under limited moisture conditions in Northwest India	RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Article						"chickpea; grain yield; intercropping system; organic; wheat"	"TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; COMPETITION; GROWTH; YIELD; NITROGEN; RATIO"	Intercropping of legumes in cereals and manuring are important measures to sustain soil fertility and enhance crop productivity in general and under organic and limited moisture conditions in particular. This study evaluated different wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) + chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) row ratios as intercrops under organic and limited moisture conditions in Northwest India with an aim to find out the suitable row ratio to get higher system productivity under these conditions. Chickpea, being a legume, produces nitrogen compounds that help the plant to grow itself and also makes them available to the companion wheat plants and thus helps in wheat nutrition, which otherwise becomes limited due to less mineralization of nitrogen under organic and cold weather conditions. The primary aim of the study was to get better productivity of wheat crop as this is an assured crop of this region. The intercropping system was evaluated in a randomized complete block design with four replications at Ludhiana, Punjab in Northwest India during 2013-2014 and 2014-2015. Effective tillers m(-1) row length, number of grains spike(-1) and 1000-grain weight of wheat were higher in wheat + chickpea (2:1) intercropping system as compared with sole wheat. This intercropping system produced significantly higher wheat grain yield, wheat equivalent yield and land equivalent ratio than sole wheat. Wheat + chickpea (2:1) and wheat + chickpea (3:1) intercropping systems gave higher water-use efficiency than sole wheat. However, chickpea gave higher yield attributes and seed yield as sole crop than that in different intercropping systems. Wheat + chickpea (2:1) and wheat + chickpea (3:1) intercropping systems produced mean wheat grain yields of 5.11 and 4.79 Mg ha(-1), respectively, along with additional mean chickpea seed yields of 0.28 and 0.24 Mg ha(-1), respectively.

We analyzed cucumber roots for differential protein expression, and protein types were identified by core technology of proteomics. 45 differential proteins were identified as being differentially expressed between monoculture and intercropping of wheat, which were involved in carbohydrate metabolism, antioxidant and stress response, growth and development regulation, biological information transfer, and nucleic acid biosynthesis. The results showed the rate of photosynthesis of cucumber was increased under wheat intercropping pattern due to three enzymes being up-regulated. The respiration of cucumber was reduced when five enzymes were down-regulated. The antioxidant and resistant capacity of cucumber was enhanced significantly under wheat intercropping pattern because two enzymes were down-regulated while the activity of four other antioxidant enzymes was up-regulated. Intercropping wheat could delay the senescence of cucumber leaves by increasing the expression of IPT gene, reducing the expression of PAO and ETR2 gene, and inhibiting the expression of Cu/Zn-SOD and GS1 gene in later stages. Two proteins related to growth and development in cucumber were up-regulated, and one was down-regulated, while two proteins related to nucleic acid biosynthesis and chaperonin showed obvious down-regulation under wheat intercropping. Therefore, the growth and development was improved and senescence of cucumber could be delayed. Under intercropping pattern, the fresh weight, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate, and peroxidase activity of cucumber plants were higher than those of cucumber monoculture groups. Thus, the senescence of cucumber could be delayed under wheat intercropping by regulating its physiological mechanisms, such as by improving photosynthesis, reducing respiratory consumption, slowing the cell apoptosis rate, and enhancing the antioxidant and resistant capacity significantly, etc.	"[Liv, Huimin; Gao, Yue; Liu, Shouwei; Zhang, Jiao; Chen, Guoqiang; Zhang, Sijia; Wu, Fengzhi] Northeast Agr Univ, Sch Hort & Landscape Architecture, Harbin 150030, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Gao, Chunqi] Qingdao Agr Univ, Sch Hort, Qingdao 266109, Shandong, Peoples R China"		Wu, FZ (corresponding author), Northeast Agr Univ, Sch Hort & Landscape Architecture, Harbin 150030, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.	wufengzhi1962@163.com	"Wu, Fengzhi/GLT-1760-2022; Gao, Chun/AAP-2262-2020"		National Natural Science Foundation of China [31471917]	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))	This work was supported by The National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers: 31471917).		56	5	5	1	24	ELSEVIER GMBH	MUNICH	HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY	0176-1617	1618-1328		J PLANT PHYSIOL	J.

This study was used to determine the suitable spatial arrangement of sunflower and peanut in an intercropping system under three irrigation water levels and three fertilizer (K) levels on yield, the land and water equivalent ratios and farmer's net income. The three irrigation treatments (0.7, 1.0 and 1.2ETo), the three K fertilizer levels (57, 86 and 114K(2)O kg/ha) and the four intercropping systems of sunflower and peanut (different spatial arrangements) were arranged in a strip split plot with three replications. The results indicated that application of 1.0 and 1.2ETo had similar effect on most of yield traits of the intercrops. Application of 114K(2)O kg/ha had the highest values of most yield traits of the intercrops. Intercropping sunflower with peanut (S1), where peanut seeds were sown on both sides of all the raised beds, sunflower seeds were sown on one row above the raised beds and the following bed was left without intercropping gave the highest values of peanut and sunflower yield and its attributes. In conclusion, the highest yield, land and water equivalent ratios, as well as farmer's net income can be obtained under 1.2ETo, 114(2)O kg/ha and SI intercropping system.

Here, we tested whether finger millet, a shallow-rooted cereal, can profit from neighboring pigeon pea, a deep-rooted legume, in the presence of biofertilization with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), under drought conditions. We conducted a greenhouse experiment using compartmented microcosms. Pigeon pea was grown in a deep compartment with access to a moist substrate layer at the bottom, whereas finger millet was grown in a neighboring shallow compartment, separated by 25-mu m nylon mesh, without access to the moist substrate layer. In the presence of a common mycorrhizal network (CMN), with or without PGPR, a drought condition had little negative effect on the biomass production of the finger millet plant whereas in absence of biofertilization, finger millet biomass production was less than half compared to well-watered condition. Biofertilization strongly increased nitrogen and phosphorus uptake by both plants, both under well-watered and drought conditions. In the presence of AMF, both plants also acquired N-15 and P-33, offered in a labeling compartment accessible to fungal hyphae but not to roots. Our results show that biofertilization with AMF alleviates the negative effects of drought condition on finger millet, indicating that the CMN connecting pigeon pea and finger millet exert clearly a positive influence in this simulated intercropping system.

The experiment was laid out in three times replicated split plot design, where main-plots received four wheat + Indian mustard intercropping row proportions (8:1, 6:2, 8:2 10:2) and sub-plots got four levels of the combined application of farmyard manure (15 and 30% N) and fertilizer (75 and 100% recommended doses of fertilizer) applied on area basis. The productivity of wheat and mustard in wheat + mustard intercropping in terms of yield parameters, viz. grains/spike, spikelets/spike, 1,000-grain weight and seed yield as well as straw yield in wheat, and siliquae/plant and seeds/siliqua of Indian mustard, were significantly higher with row proportion of 8:1 over 10:2, 8:2 and 6:2. However, seed yield and stover yield of Indian mustard was higher in 6: 2 row proportion which was at par with 8:2 and 10:2 row proportions. Wheat + Indian mustard intercropping under 10:2 row proportion proved more remunerative and recorded higher yield advantage than 8:1, 8:2 and 6:2 row proportions as judged by total land equivalent ratio, monetary advantage, net return and benefit: cost ratio. The aggressivity was higher for Indian mustard than wheat. Application of 15% or 30% N through FYM + 100% recommended doses of fertilizer (RDF) significantly enhanced yield attributes and yield of wheat and Indian mustard. The highest total land equivalent ratio and aggressivity of Indian mustard indicated superiority of the application of 30% N through FYM + 100% RDF. However, benefit: cost ratio was highest in the application of 15 kg N through FYM + 100% RDF.

The results revealed that 1:1 row ratio of dhaincha and sorghum at 30 cm spacing succeeded by wheat was found most economical and feasible cropping system among all the treatments with highest wheat equivalent yield (7.22 tonnes/ha), system profitability (7 241/ha/ day), production efficiency (2.44 tonnes WEY/ha/day), net return (71.4 x 103 7/ha), B:C ratio (1.32), energy productivity (285.4 kg/ MJ) and apparent nutrient use productivity of 20.3 kg WEY/ha-kg. The 1:1 row ratio of dhaincha with sorghum yielded almost equal seed yield of dhaincha (only 2.8% reduction) with additional yield of 17.8 tonnes/ha sorghum fodder over sole crop. Hence, for seed production dhaincha be sown at 60 cm spacing intercropped with one row of fodder sorghum in between two rows of dhaincha followed by wheat to supplement the income of farmers.

Influence of organic nutrient sources and moisture management on productivity, biofortification and soil health in pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) plus clusterbean (Cyamopsis tetragonaloba) intercropping system of semi-arid India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						"Biofortification; Clusterbean; Intercropping; Moisture; Nutrient management; Organic; Pearl millet"	"PHOSPHOGYPSUM-ENRICHED UREA; SUMMER FORAGE CROPS; RICE ORYZA-SATIVA; CROPPING SYSTEM; GROWTH; YIELD"	A field experimentation was carried out at New Delhi, India for three years (2010-12) under rainfed semi-arid conditions to assess the effect of three organic nutrient sources and two moisture management practices on productivity, biofortification and soil health under pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br. emend Stuntz] + clusterbean [Cyamopsis tetragonaloba (L.) Taub] intercropping system (PCIS). In current study, the pearl millet grain yield under sole pearl millet was at par with PCIS while its stover yield reduced by 5%. Under PCIS, inclusion of clusterbean led to significant reduction in clusterbean yield compared to its sole stand, however, PCIS system productivity was more over their sole crop stands, indicating that additive series of PCIS may bring more net economic gains over their sole stands in semi-arid ecology of India. The coarse cereal-legume interactions under PCIS have also led to improved protein content in pearl millet (11.2%) over its sole stand (10.7%). Zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) deficiency is a common feature in semi-arid India and the crops grown as well. Study revealed that Zn and Fe content in pearl millet were increased by 6.5 and 1.6%, respectively, by the inclusion of clusterbean in PCIS. Plant growth, yield attributes and yield of pearl millet and clusterbean crops showed an improvement under flat sowing + organic mulching (FS+OM) over ridge and furrow sowing (RFS) but the differences were non-significant. Among organic nutrient sources, leaf compost (LC) @ 10 t/ha and FYM @ 10 t/ha produced significantly more system productivity in terms of pearl millet-equivalent-yield (PEY) than 100% RDF and control. Protein content both in pearl millet and clusterbean, and Zn and Fe biofortification in pearl millet grains was higher under FYM treated plots closely followed by LC, and leaf + cowdung mixture compost. Application of organics especially FYM @ 10 t/ha also resulted in improved soil health in terms of bulk density, soil organic carbon and NPK status after three years experimentation.	"[Bana, R.

Several arrangements of intercropping buckwheat and squash were evaluated, with and without the introduction of a natural enemy, Delphastus catalinae (Horn), to find a tactic that reduces insect pests and disease incidence while increasing marketable yield. Intercropping treatments included planting strips of buckwheat alternating on either side of the squash with and without D. catalinae (arrangement A), planting buckwheat in the middle of squash planted on both sides of the bed with and without D. catalinae (arrangement B), buckwheat planted on both sides of squash (arrangement C), and a bare ground treatment. Aphid densities and insect-transmitted viruses were reduced, while natural enemies were more abundant, in buckwheat treatments compared with bare ground treatments.

Growing of groundnut as sole crop recorded higher pod yield (1490 kg ha(-1)) over groundnut in intercropping system. The highest pod yield (889 kg ha(-1)) of groundnut among the intercropping system was obtained with the treatment received 100 % of both RDF and plant density of groundnut and pigeon pea respectively. Which was closely followed by T-9(850 kg ha(-1)), T-2(846kg ha(-1)), T-11 (828 kg ha(-1)) and T-10(825 kg ha(-1)) and they were statistically at par among each other. Growing of pigeon pea as sole crop recorded higher grain yield (1584 kg ha(-1)) over pigeon pea in intercropping system.

Intercrops of red pea with winter cereals have not been studied. A two years field study was conducted with the objective to determine the productivity of intercropping systems of red pea with barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and triticale (xTriticosecale Wittmack) in two seeding ratios (60:40 and 80:20). Growth rate, dry matter yield, protein content and yield were determined. Several indices were used to evaluate the intercropping systems and analyse competition and interrelationships between mixture components. Growth rate of cereals was lower in the mixtures than in the monocrops. Dry matter yield were the highest in barley monocrop and its intercrop with red pea at 60:40 seeding ratio. Red pea monocrop showed the highest crude protein concentration followed by its intercrops. The land equivalent ratio, relative crowding coefficient (K), actual yield loss (AYL) and system productivity index values were greater for the red pea-barley 60:40 mixture, indicating an advantage of intercropping. The partial K, aggressivity, competitive ratio and partial AYL values indicated red pea as the dominated species in the intercrops. The highest monetary advantage value was recorded for the red pea-barley mixture (60:40). The results indicate that red pea-barley mixture (60:40) was the most productive and produced better forage quality and thus could be adopted by the farmers as alternative option for forage production.

The objectives were: (1) to evaluate the beneficial effects of C-rich manure and compost on pea productivity in different cropping systems (2) to investigate whether these effects were reflected by microbial root colonization, microbial biomass and CO2 production and (3) to study the residual, effects of the organic fertilizers on the yield of succeeding crop. Short term application of horse manure and compost greatly stimulated soil microbial biomass C, N, P, fungal ergosterol and CO2 evolution, but failed to stimulate productivity of the current crops. However, significant positive residual effects of organic fertilizer, especially horse manure were observed on the grain yield of the succeeding winter wheat. Mycorrhizal colonization and ergosterol concentration were significantly higher in pea than in oat roots. lntercropping is an important tool for controlling weeds on pea plots under organic farming conditions, but did not affect microbial root colonization, soil microbial biomass indices or CO2 evolution from the soil surface. According to the extrapolation of the CO2 evolution rates into amounts per hectare, approximately 40% of the manure C and 24% of the compost C were mineralized to CO2 during the 124-day experimental period. There were close relationships between grain N and P concentrations in both crops and microbial biomass C, N and P, suggesting that soil microbial biomass can be used as an indicator of nutrient availability to plants.

Garlic is one of the potential plant that could be inserted in crops to decrease the pest occurrence in neighboring crop plots. In this study, field works were conducted in wheat fields in Langfang Experimental Station, Hebei Province in China from October 2009 to July 2010 during wheat developmental season. The effect of wheat intercropping with garlic but also the volatiles emission on the incidence of the English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae Fabricius (Homoptera: Aphididae) was assessed. Natural beneficial occurrence and global yields in two winter wheat varieties that were susceptible or resistant to cereal aphid were also determined comparing to control plots without the use of garlic plant intercrop nor semiochemical releaser in the fields. S. avenae was found to be lower in garlic oil blend treatment (GOB), diallyl disulfide treatment (DD) and wheat-garlic intercropping treatment (WGI) when compared to the control plots for both two varieties (P<0.01). Both intercropping and application of volatile chemicals emitted by garlic could improve the population densities of natural enemies of cereal aphid, including ladybeetles and mummified aphids. Ladybeetle population density in WGI, GOB and mummified aphids densities in WGI, DD were significantly higher than those in control fields for both two varieties (P<0.05). There were significant interactions between cultivars and treatments to the population densities of S. avenae. The 1000-grain weight and yield of wheat were also increased compared to the control. Due to their potential alternatives as a biological control agent against cereal aphid, garlic intercropping and related emitted volatiles are expected to contribute to the further improvement of integrated pest management systems and to potentially reduce the amount of traditional synthetic pesticides applied in wheat fields.

Legumes intercropped with spring barley contribute to increased biomass production and carry-over effects	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article							"BIOLOGICAL NITROGEN-FIXATION; LAND EQUIVALENT RATIO; SOIL-STRUCTURE; COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS; LIGHT INTERCEPTION; ROOT DEVELOPMENT; RESOURCE USE; FIELD BEANS; WATER-USE; WHEAT"	"Intercropping systems that include legumes can provide symbiotically fixed nitrogen (N) and potentially increase yield through improved resource use efficiency. The aims of the present study were: (a) to evaluate the effects of different legumes (species and varieties) and barley on grain yield, dry matter production and N uptake of the intercrop treatments compared with the associated cereal sole crop; (b) to assess the effects on the yields of the next grain crop and (c) to determine the accumulation of N in shoots of the crops in a low-input rotation. An experiment was established near Edinburgh, UK, consisting of 12 hydrologically isolated plots. Treatments were a spring barley (Hordeum vulgare cvar Westminster) sole crop and intercrops of barley/white clover (Trifolium repens cvar Alice) and barley/pea (Pisum sativum cvar Zero4 or cvar Nitouche) in 2006. All the plots were sown with spring oats (Avena sativa cvar Firth) in 2007 and perennial ryegrass in 2008. No fertilizers, herbicides or pesticides were used at any stage of the experiment. Above-ground biomass (barley, clover, pea, oat and ryegrass) and grain yields (barley, pea and oat) were measured at key stages during the growing seasons of 2006, 2007 and 2008; land equivalent ratio (LER) was measured only in 2006. At harvest, the total above-ground biomass of barley intercropped with clover (4.56 t biomass/ha) and barley intercropped with pea cvar Zero4 (4.49 t biomass/ha) were significantly different from the barley sole crop (3.05 t biomass/ha; P<0.05). The grain yield of the barley (2006) intercropped with clover (3.36 t grain/ha) was significantly greater than that in the other treatments (P<0.01). The accumulation of N in barley was low in 2006, but significantly higher (P<0.05) in the oat grown the following year on the same plots. The present study demonstrates for the first time that intercrops can affect the grain yield and N uptake of the following crop (spring oats) in a rotation. Differences were also linked to the contrasting legume species and cultivars present in the previous year's intercrop. Legume choice is essential to optimize the plant productivity in intercropping designs. Cultivars chosen for intercropping purposes must take into account the effects upon the growth of the partner crop/s as well as to the following crop, including environmental factors."	"[Pappa, V.

(Hemiptera: Aphididae), and its natural enemies were evaluated by field and laboratory experiments. The population densities of aphids and their natural enemies were evaluated in the intercropped field against different row ratio combinations of wheat-mung bean. Results showed that wheat-mung bean intercropping caused a drop in aphid densities, and the ratio 12 wheat:4 mung bean brought about the largest drop (>18%). In addition, the population densities of coccinellids (ladybirds) and parasitoids and the species diversity of all the natural enemies of aphid were higher in the intercropped field than in the field planted only with wheat. However, intercropping did not influence the community indices (evenness and index of dominance concentration) of the natural enemies. Y-tube olfactometer bioassays were carried out in the laboratory to test whether odor blends of host and nonhost plants affect the host selection of S. avenae. Bioassays indicated that both apterous and alate aphids significantly preferred host plant odor over odor blends of host and intercropped species. Hence, the olfactory-based host location of aphids in the field might be affected by intercropping. The intercropping experiment clearly showed that increased crop species diversity suppresses aphid population growth and preserves the population of natural enemies of aphids. Our results also provide support for the resource concentration hypothesis and the enemies hypothesis.

Changes in soil nutrient concentration were measured at 0 - 30 cm. The effects of N- fertilization on cassava tuber yield and soil-N were monitored for the three seasons using factorial in randomized complete block design. There was no apparent shading effect during the growth of the two crops. Soybean was harvested 110 days after planting, while cassava was harvested at 4, 8 and 12 months after planting in each year. Cassava tuber yield was highest at intercrop X 60 and intercrop X 45 kg N ha(-1) (30.0 and 29.9 t. ha(-1)) x tuber yield of intercrop X 45 kg N ha(-1). The result indicates that 60 kg (90 - 30) of applied nitrogen could be spared per hectare by intercropping cassava with soybean due to soybean nitrogen fixation. Grain yield of soybean may not be compromised by intercropping with cassava. Soil - N increased from 0.042 mg kg(-1) before the experiment to 0.168 mg kg(-1) in sole soybean system and 0.086 mg kg(-1) in intercrop system at 8 months after planting and 0.150 mg kg(-1) in the sole soybean and 0.085 kg mg(-1) in intercrop system in 12 months after planting.

The results showed that soil microcosm environment was improved, and the fungal diversity and fungal pathogens such as Fusarium sp. and Verticillium sp. were restrained when peanut intercropped with A. lancea and E. pekinensis. The DGGE analysis of 18S-rRNA from DNA of the total soil communities showed obvious transferring of species of fungi between peanut monocropping and the intercropping systems. Compared with the control, the superoxide dismutase activity of peanut was increased by 43% in A. lancea and 37% in E. pekinensis intercropping systems, along with 37 and 16% yield improvement of peanut, respectively. Based on the result of the pot experiment, A. lancea and E. pekinensis were intercropped with peanuts in a field experiment. A considerable agreement was found between the results obtained from the field and pot experiments. Compared with peanut monocropping system, colony form unit of mould decreased by 31% in A. lancea and 18% in E. pekinensis intercropping treatments, where peanut yields were respectively increased by 39 and 35%. Further research should include integrated PCR-DGGE analysis to determine the transfer of peanut soil-born pathogens and its mechanism, and the optimization of intercropping system and planting density of medicinal plants to obtain the best benefits, and the understanding of the long-term effect of the intercropping systems.

P fertilizer was applied at three depths (15, 35, and 55 cm). The experimental results showed that the planting pattern and P-32 application depth significantly affected the characteristics of P uptake by soybean and citrus. Under the soybean-citrus intercropping system, considerable competition was observed when the P-32 fertilizer was applied to the topsoil (15 cm); therefore, the P-32 recovery rate declined by 41.5% and 14.7% for soybean and citrus, and P-32 supplying amount of topsoil to soybean and citrus decreased by 346.8 and 148.1 mg plot(-1), respectively, compared to those under the monoculture. However, P-32 recovery of soybean was promoted when P-32 fertilizer was applied to the deeper soil layers (35 and 55 cm) under soybean-citrus intercropping. Under the soybean monoculture, P-32 fertilizer could hardly be used by soybean when P-32 fertilizer was applied at the 55 cm depth or below, with the recovery rate being less than 0.1%; it was up to 0.253% by soybean under intercropping. The higher P recovery of soybean under soybean-citrus intercropping when P was applied in the deeper soil layers was because part of the P nutrient that the citrus absorbed from the deeper soil layers could be released into the topsoil and then it could be used by the soybean."

Yield advantage and reciprocity functions of wheat (Triticum aestivum) plus Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) intercropping under varying row ratio, variety and fertility level	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						"aggressivity; competitive ratio; economics; fertility levels; land equivalent ratio; mustard variety; row ratio; relative crowding coefficient; wheat; Indian mustard; intercropping"	COMPETITION	A field experiment was conducted during winter seasons of 1999-2000 and 2000-01 at Varanasi to assess the effect of varying row ratio, mustard variety and fertility levels on various competitive functions in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) + Indian mustard (Brassica juncea Czern & Coss) intercropping. Mustard was found dominant and aggressive as compared to wheat. Wheat and mustard under 8:1 and 5:1 row ratios proved more remunerative and recorded higher yield advantage than 2:1 row ratio as judged by land equivalent ratio and relative crowding coefficient. Significantly higher aggressivity (1.034) and competitive ratio (2.245) of mustard was noticed under wheat + 'Vardan' mustard intercropping which caused drastic reduction in wheat yield. Consequently, the total land equivalent ratio and relative crowding coefficient of the system was markedly higher with 'Sanjucta Asesh' that gave maximum monetary advantage. Increasing fertility up to highest level correspondingly enhanced competitive ratio and aggressivity of mustard. However, the reverse trend was observed on wheat for these indices. The maximum total land equivalent ratio of 1.085 and net return was observed with the application of 100% recommended fertilizer to both the component crops.

J	"Thorsted, MD; Olesen, JE; Weiner, J"				"Thorsted, MD; Olesen, JE; Weiner, J"			Width of clover strips and wheat rows influence grain yield in winter wheat/white clover intercropping	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"intercropping; winter wheat; white clover; competition; crop management; yield components; nitrogen uptake"	"WHITE CLOVER; NITROGEN APPLICATION; IRRIGATION STRATEGY; FUNGICIDE CONTROL; SANDY SOIL; WEEDS; SUPPRESSION; COMPETITION; DENSITY; GROWTH"	Cereal-legume intercropping offers potential benefits in low-input cropping systems, where nutrient inputs, in particular nitrogen (N), are limited. In the present study, winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) were intercropped by sowing the wheat into rototilled strips in an established stand of white clover. A field experiment was performed in two fields starting in two different years to explore the effects of width of the wheat rows and clover strips on the competition between the species and on wheat yields. The factors were intercropping (clover sole crop, wheat sole crop and wheat/clover intercropping), rototilled band width, sowing width and wheat density in a factorial experimental design that enabled some of the interactions between the factors to be estimated. The measurements included grain yield, ear density, grain weight, grain N concentration, dry matter and N in above-ground biomass of wheat, clover and weeds and profiles of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) within the crop canopy. Intercropping of winter wheat and clover resulted in wheat grain yield decreases of 10-25% compared with a wheat sole crop. The yield reductions were likely caused by interspecific competition for light and N during vegetative growth, and for soil water during grain filling. N uptake in the wheat intercrop increased during late season growth, resulting in only small differences in total N uptake between wheat intercrops and sole crops, but increased grain N concentrations in the intercrop. Interspecific competition during vegetative wheat growth was reduced by increasing width of the rototilled strips from 7 to 14 cm, resulting in higher grain yields and increased grain N uptake. Increasing the sowing width of the wheat crop from 3 to 6 cm increased interspecific interactions and reduced wheat intraspecific competition during the entire growing season, leading to improved grain yields and higher grain N uptake.

A field experiment was repeated in 2 years on a loamy sand in Denmark to investigate the possibilities for increasing N supply to the winter wheat by cutting and mulching the clover between the wheat rows. The clover was cut with a weed brusher on three different dates in each year. Intercropped wheat with unbrushed clover had a lower grain yield than wheat as a sole crop. Brushing increased wheat N uptake and wheat grain yields. Intercropping with two or three brushing dates gave higher wheat yields than wheat as the sole crop. The largest increases in grain N uptake, 21-25 kg N ha(-1), were obtained for the brushings around wheat flag leaf emergence. The highest yield increases with a single brushing, 0.98-1.11 Mg DM ha(-1), were obtained when brushing was performed during the stem elongation phase. The largest grain yields for treatments with two brushings were obtained with a first brushing at start of stem elongation and a second around flag leaf emergence. The first brushing probably provided N to increase the wheat leaf area index and thus the light interception, while the second brushing provided N to sustain the leaf area during grain filling and reduced clover biomass and therefore competition for water. Intercropping wheat and clover increased grain N concentrations by 0.11-0.39%-point compared with wheat as a sole crop. Intercropping may thus offer possibilities for improving the bread-making quality of organically grown wheat. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Pearlmillet intercropped with cowpea (28.09 %)and greengram (27.81 %)showed higher weed-smothering efficiency compared to 25.76% of pearlmillet + clusterbean [Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taubert]. Higher weed-control efficiency (63.98 to 66.34%) and least weed-competition index (15.79 to 16.42%) were recorded under intercropping systems than sole pearlmillet. Sole pearlmillet gave significantly high grain yield, while intercropping systems fetched significantly higher net returns compared to sole pearlmillet. Maximum nutrients depletion by weeds was recorded to the extent of 26.2 kg N, 2.4 kg P and 24.8 kg K/ha at 60 days after sowing under sole pearlmillet, whereas minimum under pearlmillet intercropped with cowpea and greengram. Hand-weeding twice (30 and 45 days after sowing) remained at par with pendimethalin and oxadiazon each at 1.0 kg/ha + hand-weeding once significantly reduced the weed population (91 and 78/m(2)) and dry-matter (616 and 625 kg/ha) at 60 days after sowing and at harvest, respectively, compared to rest of the weed-management practices. All the weed-control measures significantly increased the weed-control efficiency and weed-smothering efficiency 69.6 to 79.5% and 18.4 to 25.5 % compared with the unweeded control. Least weed-competition index (3.1 to 20.7%) was recorded under weed-control measures compared with unweeded control (55.9%).

R.Br. emend. Stuntz] with pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] and castor (Ricinus communis L.) under varying fertility levels. The experiment was conducted in split-plot design with 3 cropping systems (pearlmillet sole, pearlmillet + pigeonpea and pearlmillet + castor) in main plots and 4 sets of fertility levels (control, 40 kg N/ha, 40 kg N + 30 kg P2O5/ha, 80 kg N + 60 kg P2O5/ha) in sub-plots, replicated 4 times. Intercropping had no effect on yield attributes of pearlmillet. Sole pearlmillet gave significantly higher grain yield than pearlmillet intercropped with pigeonpea or castor. Sole pearlmillet recorded higher N and P uptake than intercropped pearlmillet. The maximum pearlmillet-grain equivalent, net returns and benefit : cost ratio were obtained with pearmillet + pigeonpea followed by pearlmillet + castor. Sole pearlmillet recorded the lowest pearlmillet-grain equivalent net returns and benefit : cost ratio. The yield and yield attributes of pearlmillet pearlmillet-grain equivalent, N and P uptake and net returns were higher with higher dose, i.e. 80 kg N + 60 kg P2O5/ha.

Merr.] and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] intercropping (2:1 row ratio) in comparison to their sole crops at 3 levels of nitrogen (0, 75 and 100% recommended dose). Sole sorghum recorded higher seed, straw and soybean-equivalent yield (SEY) compared to either sole soybean or soybean + sorghum intercropping. However at N-0, soybean + sorghum intercropping resulted in higher SEY and at higher N status (75 or 100%), sole sorghum resulted in higher SEY. Nitrogen-uptake was higher in sole soybean, whereas P and K uptake were higher in sole sorghum. Sole sorghum recorded higher nutrient-use efficiency (NUE), whereas sole soybean resulted in lower NUE. However, nutrient harvest index of NPK were higher in sole soybean and lowest in sole sorghum. Increased N levels significantly improved the SEY, nutrient uptake and agronomic and recovery efficiency of NPK. However, physiological efficiency and nutrient harvest index of NPK were not affected due to increased N levels.

The treatments comprised 4 main plot treatments with 2 methods of planting pearlmillet with and without intercrop and 7 levels of fertilizers. The transplanting of pearlmillet was on a par with direct seeding. Although the transplanted crop had lower grain weight/ear and shorter ear length, it had more ears/m(2) and greater 1,000-grain weight than direct-seeded crop which led to similar yield under both the conditions.

Merrill] and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) on forage production, an experiment was carried out in a field at the Universidade Federal de Lavras - MG. The experiment was conducted on a Dusky Red Latosol of loamy texture. The experimental desing utilized was that of randomized blocks in factorial scheme 5 x 2 x 2 + 2 + 2 with three replications, constituted of 5 systems of cutting, 2 soybean cultivars (CAC-1 and Conquista) and 2 hybrids of sorghum (AG 2002 and BR 601). In the first system the sorghum and soybean plants were cut closed to the soil only one time, at the farinaceous stage of sorghum. In the second, the plants were cut twice, the first cut at the height of 30cm and the second, after regrowth, close to the soil, both being done at the farinaceous stage of sorghum. In the third system, the first two cuts were done at the plant height of 30 cm, at the farinaceous stage of sorghum. The fourth system was a cut done at the vegetative stage of the soybean (V(8)-V(12)), at the plant height of 30cm, and the other, after regrowth, was done close to the soil, at the R(5) stage. In the fifth system, the first cut was done at the vegetative stage of soybean (V(8)-V(12)), at the plant height of 30 cm, and the second, after regrowth, was done at the farinaceous stage of the sorghum, close to the soil. The cuttings at the farinaceous stage of sorghum (system 3) provided greater total green mass, dry matter and total crude protein. The association of sorghum AG2002 and CAC-1 showed a great increase in the amount of total green mass, dry matter and total crude protein.

These tests were carried out for two field experiments, respectively, drilled during the spring of 1997 and autumn of 1997 on Imperial College Farm, Wye, UK. Results indicated that optimum forage yield and quality were obtained from the second to third harvest dates for the spring-drilled experiment and the second harvest for the autumn-drilled experiment. Wheat and bean intercrops were higher in total forage dry matter (DM) yield than either wheat or bean grown as sole crops. Field bean intercropped with wheat led to increased forage quality (CP and NDF concentrations) compared with sole wheat, and higher WSC concentrations compared with sole bean. Intercrops also enhanced weed suppression compared with sole bean. It is suggested that winter wheat-bean intercrops may have considerable potential as a moderate-yielding, relatively high-quality, low-input and environmentally benign forage crop with considerable potential with regard to yield and quality and warrant further study.

R. Br. emend. Stuntz]. Dry-matter accumulation and N, P and K depletion by weeds and yield of pearlmillet did not differ due to intercropping. But greengram (Phaselous radiatus L.) as an intercrop gave higher yield than cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.]. However, total uptake of N, P and K was influenced significantly by intercropping system, being maximum with pearlmillet + greengram intercropping. This treatment also registered the highest water-use efficiency. Dry-matter accumulation and nutrients depletion by weeds were minimum under hand-weeding twice closely, followed by pendimethalin at 0.75 kg/ha + hand-weeding 6 weeks after sowing. Consequently, these treatments were equally effective in improving grain yield and nutrients uptake and water-use efficiency of crops. Pendimethalin at 0.75 kg/ha alone proved to be the least effective in these regards.

R. Br. emend. Stuntz] with pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] in relation to various measures of weed control. Treatments consisted of 3 intercropping systems (sole pearlmillet, sole pigeonpea and pearlmillet + pigeonpea) and 4 methods of weed control (control hand-weeding twice, fluchloralin @ 1.0 kg/ha and pendimethalin @ 1.0 kg/ha). Intercropping did not influence the population and dry-matter accumulation by weeds. Grain yield of pearlmillet did not vary significantly due to various methods of cropping. However, sole pigeonpea gave significantly higher yield than pearlmillet + pigeonpea intercropping. Highest total productivity in terms of pearlmillet equivalent was recorded with pearlmillet + pigeonpea intercropping system. Weeding caused significant reduction in weed infestation and improvement in grain yield of pearlmillet and pigeonpea and total productivity compared with the control. Best results were achieved with hand-weeding twice closely followed by fluchloralin @ 1.0 kg/ha.

Fiori & Paol.], with yellow sarson (Brassica campestris L.) and local grasspea (Lathyrus sativus L.), grown for fodder and grain under rainfed condition. Intercropping of grasspea either for grain or fodder and yellow sarson with wheat was found biologically sustainable over sole wheat. Between the intercrop the association of wheat with grasspea was more beneficial than mustard. Association of wheat with grasspea (G) under either 3:1 or 1:1 and grasspea (F) under 3:1 row ratio was found more sustainable as, these were accounted for better value in respect of biological parameters and were economically more remunerative. Three crop combination in alternate rows (1:1:1) failed to overcome double crops but more feasible agronomically over sole stand.

The soil was sandy loam having 10.5 and 2.5% moisture content (w/w) at field capacity and -15 bar tensions, respectively. Decreasing the density of pearl millet (principal crop) from 20 to 13.3 plants m(-2) increased its yield, but further decrease to 10 plants m(-2) decreased the yield at all levels of intercrop component densities irrespective of the type of season. The yield of component crops depended more on the effective storage of moisture in the, soil profile and availability of moisture at reproductive stage (weeks 8-12) rather than quantum of rainfall during the season. Component density combination of 13.3 plants m(-2) of pearl miller with 5 plants m(-2) of mung bean was optimum and resulted in the highest grain yield, LER and WUE in all seasons. Moisture stress in below normal season and the availability of radiation in lower half of the canopy in good rainfall situation was a limiting factor for pearl millet yield. Higher consumptive use (214-254 mm) was recorded in moisture stress free seasons compared to below normal rainfall season (150-157 mm). On an average, harvest index was lower (0.24) in moisture stress season (due to differential influence of terminal drought on grain and total dry matter yield) as compared to normal and above normal rainfall seasons (0.42). High sustainable yield index for pearl miller under optimum component density (0.37) compared to sole cropping (0.23) indicated better stability of pearl miller production due to intercropping in arid environment.

Oxyfluorfen @ 0.235 kg/ha pre-emergence and 1 hand-weeding at 30 days were statistically at par and proved significantly superior to fluchloralin @ 1.0 kg/ha pre-plant incorporation in reducing weed and their dry weight. Weed-control efficiency (WCE) under these treatments was higher. Sole soybean and intercropping of niger (Guizotia abyssinica Cass.) with sobyean were found statistically at par and superior to remaining 2 intercropping treatments in reducing dry matter and showed better WCE over others. One hand-weeding at 30 days and oxyfluorfen @ 0.235 kg/ha pre-emergence resulted in significantly higher plant height, branching and seed yield/plant and crop biomass than other weeding methods, Significantly higher grain and soybean-equivalent yields were under sole soybean compared with other intercropping system. Intercropping of soybean with pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp,] and sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) being statistically at par were superior to niger. Among weed-control methods, 1 hand-weeding at 30 days and oxyfluorfen @ 0.235 kg/ha preemergence being statistically at par were superior to fluchloralin @ 1 kg/ha preplant incorporation.

Intercropping soybean with pigeonpea in 4 : 1 row arrangement proved superior to other treatments and yielded 712 kg/ha soybean and 830 kg/ha pigeonpea seed, which amounted to 1 493 kg/ha soybean-equivalent yield compared with 1086 kg/ha sole-soybean yield. This system also recorded the highest land-equivalent ratio (1.26). Intercropping systems showed higher water use and water-use efficiency than sole soybean. The values of competitive ratio (CR), relative crowding coefficient (RCC) and aggressivity indicated that sorghum and pigeonpea were dominant over soybean. The aggressivity values of soybean were negative in all the intercropping systems, whereas CR and RCC values remained <1. Sorghum showed higher competitiveness with soybean than with pigeonpea.

Boohai) and clover (Trifolium quartinianum A. Rich) on the dry matter yield of shoots and roots and on the seed yield of wheat and clover was studied in wooden boxes in the dry and wet seasons with and without N applied to wheat. Root interaction, but not shoot interaction, affected the yields of the two component crops significantly. The intermingling of clover roots with wheat roots increased wheat yield while reducing that of clover. An application of N fertilizer to wheat did not alter this relationship, although it increased wheat yield. Nitrogen increased wheat yield more in the presence of root interaction with clover than in its absence, Early competition for N reduced clover yield when both root systems interacted.

UPAS 120, in order to study the effects of intercropping on rice grain yield and its contributing characteristics during 1990 to 1992 wet seasons. Cropping system and cropping system x genotype interaction effects were significant for yield ha(-1), panicle weight, panicles m(-2) and spikelet fertility suggesting the need for evaluating and selecting genotypes suitable for intercropping. Rice grain yield reduction in the intercrop ranged from 24.5% in genotype RR 203-16 to 54.5% in genotype Aditya. Panicle weight, total dry matter at flowering as well as at harvest, and harvest index were also reduced. Plant height and panicle weight were positively associated with yield in both systems, however, the yield was positively and significantly correlated with spikelets per panicle and spikelet fertility with the intercropping system. The correlation between cropping systems indicated the possibility of simultaneous improvement for these characteristics in monocropping and intercropping.

There were six planting patterns for the crop mixture using two cassava varieties, U/41044 and TMS 30555. The mean mite damage was least on cassava intercropped with pigeon pea and highest on cassava cropped sole. Pigeon pea neither harboured mites nor supported mite growth, and offered some protection to cassava by reducing mite infestation in the crop mixture. Cassava intercropped with pigeon pea in triple and double rows gave higher root yields than where it was alternated in single row, on the same row or where cassava was planted sole. There was no statistical difference among the grain yield of pigeon pea in the treatments.

'Maris Ledger') was seeded at rates ranging from 5 to 30 kg ha 1 as either a monocrop or an intercrop with 50, 100 or 150 kg ha-1 of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L. 'Diamond'). When ryegrass is intercropped with barley, cuts 1 and 2 are usually ensiled and the remainder of seasonal production is pastured (the equivalent of two forage cuts). Monocropped annual ryegrass produced 91 % as much dry matter (DM) in the silage cuts as intercropped annual ryegrass and barley but produced 105 % as much pasture. Over the season, monocropped ryegrass produced 11.1 t ha-1 of forage compared with 11.7 t ha-1 for intercropped annual ryegrass and barley. Among the intercropping treatments, increased barley seeding rate resulted in greater cut 1 yields, but this was offset by reduced cut 2 yields, so barley seeding rate did not affect the yield of DM for silage. Only 50 kg ha-1 of barley seed was required to obtain maximum yearly forage yields when intercropping with annual ryegrass. No more than 10 kg ha-1 of ryegrass seed was required for optimal yield when monocropping, and no more than 15 kg ha-1 when ryegrass was intercropped with barley. Monocropped ryegrass produced superior quality forage for silage. When quality was weighted for the relative yields of cuts 1 and 2, the monocrop averaged 16 % protein and 72 % in vitro disappearance of dry matter (IVDDM) compared with 12 % protein and 58 % IVDDM for the intercrops. Among the intercrops, increasing barley seeding rate from 50 kg ha-1 to 150 kg ha-1 did not affect the protein contents of silage cuts, but it decreased IVDDM from 60% to 56%. Pasture forage quality was not affected by barley seeding rate.

The experiment was carried out in a red ferrallitic soil sown at the end of the rainy period. The star grass-dolichos system produced the highest dry matter yield (19.54 t/ha) and dolichos was the temporary culture yielding most (7.69 t/ha DM). Yield was lowest in non-intercropped pasture (P < 0.001). The area covered by pasture at the end of the experiment was superior to that of the control (98%). Dolichos and soybean showed a greater protein content (P < 0.01) followed by amaranthus which offered the highest K and Ca percentages. The advantages of the system are discussed and the best option was 20 kg of dolichos seed intercropped when star grass was sown and as additional option soybean and amaranthus.

All treatments were intercrops; when barley cultivar effects are described they are averaged over the ryegrasses and vice versa. Barley cultivars differed in grain maturity. Ryegrass cultivars included diploid and tertraploid Italian and Westerwolds types. Intercrops including late grain maturing barley cultivars (Samson and Virden) increased the yield of the first silage cut (both by 25% over 2 yr) compared to Diamond, a medium-maturing cultivar adapted to the area. Intercrops containing the semi-dwarf barley. Samson, produced more digestible forage including higher in vitro digestible dry matter (IVDDM) and lower ADF and lignin. Annual ryegrass yield in the first cut intercropped with Samson was almost twice that with either Diamond or Virden, showing that Samson barley is less competitive. Second-cut yield (ryegrass regrowth) was greater for tetraploid than diploid annual ryegrasses. Yields of fall pasture (cuts 3 and 4) were similar among ryegrass cultivars. Cuts 2 and 3 (ryegrass only) of Italian ryegrasses had superior quality (higher IVDDM and protein; and lower ADF, lignin, and NDF) to Westerwolds ryegrasses, but all cultivars had similar quality in the late fall (Cut 4).

In the field in 1988, N-15 applied directly to a petiole of nodulating soybean was detected at significantly higher levels in adjacent corn plants than when unenriched N was similarly applied. Applications of enriched N and unenriched N to nodulating soybean roots did not result in significant differences in % N-15 an adjacent corn plants. However, in greenhouse experiments, enriched N applied in split-root systems to secondary roots of nodulating soybean, was detected at higher levels in associated corn and non-nodulating soybean than when unenriched N was similarly applied.

The aim of this field investigation was to optimize planting time and spatial arrangement for boosting yield, quality and profitability of intercropped soybean. Treatments included soybean sown 20 days before and after sorghum under different spatial arrangements (3-1, 1-3, 2-3, 3-2 and 3-3 row proportions). The factorial arrangement was used to employ randomized complete block design (RCBD) for experimental execution with four replicates. Soybean sown 20 days prior to sorghum in 2-3 row replacement series was effective in yielding the highest yield attributes of soybean, which led to the highest green forage yield and dry matter biomass. The same intercropping system proved to be superior in generating the highest net income and benefit-cost ratio (BCR) (4.31). Correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between agronomic variables under study and forage yield of soybean. Better quality forage with significantly higher crude protein, ether extractable fat and ash along with the lowest crude fiber content was given by soybean planted 20 days before sorghum in 3-2 row proportion. Soybean sown 20 days after sorghum under all spatial arrangements did not perform at par with soybean sown 20 days before sorghum. Thus, in order to avoid the drastic effects of sorghum on soybean forage yield and quality in soybean-sorghum intercropping systems, deferred sowing of sorghum might be considered keeping in view the availability of irrigation water and available time with respect of next crop.

Interactions among cultivars and cropping systems do occur and genotypes bred for pure cropping may not be suitable for intercropping. This study was undertaken to obtain estimates of genetic parameters of quality traits for bush bean landraces grown in two cropping systems, and the interrelationships of these traits between pure cropping and intercropping with maize (Zea mays L.). Field experiments were conducted at two locations for two years. Expression of most traits was not strongly influenced by genotype x environment interactions. Heritability estimates were similar in both cropping systems for most pod and seed quality traits. Positive correlations were observed between pure cropping and intercropping for pod characters (weight, length, width and texture) and seed characters (dry and imbided weight, length, hardness, coat proportion, water absorption and crude protein). Use of a selection index is suggested for breeding for seed size, water absorption, coat proportion and crude protein for both cropping systems. However, larger gains would be expected in pure cropping for most traits. Bean accessions PHA-0267, PHA-0285, PHA-0286 and PHA-0299 should be used for developing acceptable culinary and high protein breeding lines for either cropping system.

However, how their profitability vary across cropping seasons has not been fully explored. Thus, farmers are often faced with the dilemma of which agricultural technique(s) and/or combination(s) thereof to implement in which cropping seasons, and for which crops to maximize profits. In this paper, we investigated the profitability of two soil and water conservation techniques (terraces and borders) and compared them against the conventional flat cultivation in Makanya catchment Tanzania. Farmers in the area grow maize, beans, lablab and cowpeas over three cropping seasons (locally called masika, vuli and chamazi/kipupwe). Based on field survey of 382 farmers in 2019, it was found that aggregate yields were generally higher on fields with intercrop than those with monocrop with more than 0.5 ton/ha of total grain yields. Borders were generally more profitable (399 USD/ha) than terraces and flat cultivation during all three cropping seasons while flat cultivation was more lucrative during the masika than vuli season. Terraces was only lucrative for rainfed beans with Benefit Cost Ratio of 1.5 (208.7 USD/ha) and 1.2 (90.5 USD/ha) in masika and vuli respectively. Beans grown on borders during chamazi season had the highest profitability with Benefit Cost Ratio of 1.9 (399 USD/ha) compared to terraces and flat cultivation in all three cropping seasons. Whereas it was more profitable to grow maize, beans and lablab on borders, farmers could still realize appreciable profits by growing these crops as purely rainfed on flat cultivation especially during the masika season. It was concluded that in semi-arid zones, soil and water conservation techniques used in combination with other auxiliary practices such as irrigation, intercropping with legumes, mulching and manure application could greatly enhance profitability, but that depends on cropping season and market factors.

Sweet, for smallholder production in East Africa	PLOS ONE			English	Article							"SHORT-SEASON ACCESSIONS; CROPPING SYSTEMS; GRAIN LEGUMES; ENVIRONMENT; MAIZE; YIELD; INTENSIFICATION; PREFERENCES; INTERCROPS"	Climate change is posing severe challenges in Africa, where resilient crops are urgently needed to withstand drought periods and unreliable rainfall. Multi-purpose legume species, such as lablab (Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet), have been under-utilized yet have the potential to overcome climate challenges. While lablab is native to Africa, there are few characterized varieties and it is under-utilized by smallholder farmers due to a lack of information and access to varieties. Knowledge is especially lacking on the performance of this crop by genotype, management, and environment. We conducted a two-year field study at two sites to evaluate 29 lablab cultivars under sole and maize intercrop management, with 14 cultivars selected for in-depth study. Cultivars were evaluated on vegetative biomass and grain yield production, with N fixation assessed for one site year. Biomass and grain production differed across environments and cultivars, with only biomass affected by intercropping. Average grain yield was substantially reduced to only 37 kg ha(-1) in environments with maximum temperatures greater than 33 degrees C, but biomass production yielded comparable amounts across high temperatures and in dry (< 500 mm rainfall) environments. Tradeoffs were found between biomass and grain yield across high yielding cultivars, with the top three grain accessions averaging 612 kg ha(-1) of grain and 1.97 Mg ha(-1) biomass whereas the top three biomass accessions produced 327 kg ha(-1) grain and 2.52 Mg ha(-1) biomass across all environments. In a comparison of production and N fixation measurements, cultivars were identified which may have high performance in both. Suitability of lablab for grain and biomass production were visualized across Tanzania in a map comparing max temperature thresholds for grain and biomass against average regional livestock populations. This provides a way forward for identifying potential areas for lablab cultivation as a novel means to enhance fodder and pulse production with smallholder farmers.

The maize monoculture was set as control (CK), five straw mulch treatments (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%, SM1-SM5) and four biochar mulch treatments (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, BM1-BM4), which were set according to mulch application rate from low to high, and alfalfa, chicory and ryegrass intercropping in maize were set as 3 living mulches (LM1-LM3), 13 treatments in total. Observation of soil moisture, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and total potassium (TK) in the plough layer were carried out in 2018. When straw mulch application rate reached SM5, the soil moisture reached the maximum, which was significantly higher than CK and SM1-SM3 (p<0.05), but not significantly higher than SM4 (p>0.05) biochar and living mulch did not significantly improve the moisture; the overall water conservation effect of straw mulch was better than that of biochar and living mulch. Soil TOC, TN and TP with high straw and biochar mulch application rate was significantly higher than CK, however, the increase of straw and biochar mulch had no significant effect on TK; TN of LM1 was significantly higher than CK, LM2 and LM3 (p<0.05). Among the three types of organic mulches, the TOC was high under straw and biochar mulch, and the TOC, TN and TP under biochar mulch were the largest, which was significantly higher than that of LM (p<0.05). The results indicated that straw mulch played an important role in water conservation and fertility enhancement, and about 6 Mg ha(-1) of straw mulch could be an appropriate reference mulch application rate for karst areas in Southwest China."

However, animals can serve as a seed dispersal mechanism. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the introduction of leguminous calopogonium, macrotiloma, tropical kudzu and soybeans, in perennial pastures of Brachiaria decumbens, through dispersal in cattle dung. For this purpose we used five heifers as seeds disseminator, which were offered 180g seeds of each leguminous, alternately mixed with the concentrated, waiting a period of 48 hours to complete the seed defecation. All leguminous were found in fecal plates, but kudzu had the greatest number of specimens found in relation to others (P < .05). However, when evaluated persistence after establishment and grazing found fewer copies to kudzu in the other three leguminous (P < 0.05) that did not differ among themselves. When, the percentage of seeds germinated in the stool, relative to the amount offered in 180g of seed for this propagation mechanism, can be considered low for the four leguminous studied.

This study aimed to clarify the N and P accumulation and N: P ratio at organ and plant level of a local legume species mixed with a grass species under varying water and fertilizer supplies, and thus to fully understand the requirements and balance of nutrient elements in response to growth conditions change of native species. The N and P concentration in the organ (leaf, stem, and root) and plant level of Lespedeza davurica (C-3 legume), were examined when intercropped with Bothriochloa ischaemum (C-4 grass). The two species were grown outdoors in pots under 80, 60, and 40% of soil water field capacity (FC), NP, C N, C P, and C NP supply and the grass: legume mixture ratios of 2: 10, 4: 8, 6: 6, 8: 4, 10: 2, and 12: 0. The three set of treatments were under a randomized complete block design. Intercropping with B. ischaemum did not affect N concentrations in leaf, stem and root of L. davurica, but reduced P concentration in each organ under P fertilization. Only leaf N concentration in L. davurica showed decreasing trend as soil water content decreased under all fertilization and mixture proportion treatments. Stems had the lowest, while roots had the highest N and P concentration. As the mixture proportion of L. davurica decreased under P fertilization, P concentration in leaf and root also decreased. The N concentration in L. davurica at the whole plant level was 11.1-17.2%. P fertilization improved P concentration, while decreased N: P ratio in L. davurica. The N: P ratios were less than 14.0 under C P and C NP treatments. Our results implied that exogenous N and P fertilizer application may change the N: P stoichiometry and influence the balance between nutrients and organs of native dominant species in natural grassland, and P element should be paid more attention when considering rehabilitating degraded grassland via fertilization application in semiarid Loess Plateau region.

J	Wasternack, C				Wasternack, Claus			Action of jasmonates in plant stress responses and development Applied aspects	BIOTECHNOLOGY ADVANCES			English	Review						"Jasmonic acid; 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid; Necrotrophic pathogens; Mycorrhiza; Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria; Intercropping; JA-induced secondary metabolite production; Anti-cancer activity"	"BARLEY LEAF SEGMENTS; ROOT-KNOT NEMATODES; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; ALKALOID METABOLISM; INDUCED SENESCENCE; GENE-EXPRESSION; ABIOTIC STRESS; IN-VITRO; ARABIDOPSIS"	Jasmonates (JAs) are lipid-derived compounds acting as key signaling compounds in plant stress responses and development. The JA co-receptor complex and several enzymes of JA biosynthesis have been crystallized, and various JA signal transduction pathways including cross-talk to most of the plant hormones have been intensively studied. Defense to herbivores and necrotrophic pathogens are mediated by JA. Other environmental cues mediated by JA are light, seasonal and circadian rhythms, cold stress, desiccation stress, salt stress and UV stress. During development growth inhibition of roots, shoots and leaves occur by JA, whereas seed germination and flower development are partially affected by its precursor 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA). Based on these numerous JA mediated signal transduction pathways active in plant stress responses and development, there is an increasing interest in horticultural and biotechnological applications. Intercropping, the mixed growth of two or more crops, mycorrhization of plants, establishment of induced resistance, priming of plants for enhanced insect resistance as well as pre- and post-harvest application of JA are few examples. Additional sources for horticultural improvement, where JAs might be involved, are defense against nematodes, biocontrol by plant growth promoting rhizobacteria, altered composition of rhizosphere bacterial community, sustained balance between growth and defense, and improved plant immunity in intercropping systems. Finally, biotechnological application for JA-induced production of pharmaceuticals and application of JAs as anti-cancer agents were intensively studied. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	"Jacobs, JL; Ward, GN"				"Jacobs, J. L.; Ward, G. N."			Companion cropping chicory with winter forage cereals for grazing and forage conservation. Dry matter yields, nutritive characteristics and mineral content	ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE			English	Article							"CICHORIUM-INTYBUS; WHEAT RATIO; GROWTH; SILAGE; MATURITY; DIGESTIBILITY; PERFORMANCE; PERSISTENCE; INTERCROPS; BALANCE"	Limitations to the current perennial ryegrass-based pasture system on dryland dairy farms in southern Australia has led to research into alternatives that can produce either additional DM, out of season feed or can improve nutritive characteristics. The use of winter annual crops followed by a summer crop have the potential to achieve these goals but often result in considerable periods where new crops are establishing and feed is not available for consumption. Companion cropping offers an option to overcome these limitations. The experiment reported in this paper examines the DM yields, nutritive characteristics and mineral content of companion cropping wheat or triticale at different sowing rates into an existing chicory monoculture over a 2-year period. We hypothesised that oversowing cereal crops in autumn into an existing stand of chicory would result in improvements in nutritive characteristics at ensiling, without adversely affecting DM yield or subsequent chicory DM yields following harvesting, thus negating the need to sow a new summer forage crop each year. Total DM yields for the chicory and cereal monocultures were similar over the experimental period, while DM yields for all triticale mixtures were higher than the chicory only treatment. Chicory produced lower DM yields for silage but higher DM yields at most grazing events. The crude protein and estimated metabolisable energy content of the chicory only treatment was higher than the cereal monocultures and all triticale/chicory mixtures at both silage harvests with wheat/chicory mixes being intermediate. The proportion of chicory in the mixed swards declined over the course of the experiment. The use of chicory with cereals resulted in no adverse effects on total DM yields, some improvements in nutritive characteristics and mineral content and a more continuous supply of DM compared with double cropping with annual species in winter and summer. This experiment has highlighted the potential of oversowing cereal forages into an existing chicory sward to contribute to DM production on dairy farms in southern Australia. Such forage mixes can provide flexibility into forage systems through the provision of forage for grazing in early winter, the production of high DM yield silage harvests and then subsequent feed supply over summer and early autumn.

On an Andosol in NW Tanzania, we studied the short-term effects of amending standard compost, biogas slurry and CaSa compost (containing biochar and sanitized human excreta) on (i) the soil's physico-chemical properties, on (ii) biomass growth and crop productivity, and on (iii) the plants' nutrient status. The practice-oriented experiment design included the intercropping of seven locally grown crop species planted on 9 m(2) plots with five repetitions arranged as a Latin rectangle. Differences in plant growth (biomass production and crop yield, e.g., of Zea mays) and crop nutrition (total C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Zn, etc.) were related to pH, CEC (cation exchange capacity), total C and the availability of nutrients (N, P, K, etc.) and water (water retention characteristics, bulk density, etc.) in the soil. None of the amendments had any significant effect on soil water availability, so the observed variations in crop yield and plant nutrition are attributed to nutrient availability. Applying CaSa compost increased the soil pH from 5.3 to 5.9 and the level of available P from 0.5 to 4.4 mg per kg. Compared to the control, adding biogas slurry, standard compost and CaSa compost increased the aboveground biomass of Zea mays by, respectively, 140, 154 and 211 %. The grain yields of maize on soil treated with biogas slurry, standard compost and CaSa compost were, respectively, 2.63, 3.18 and 4.40 t ha(-1), compared to only 1.10 t ha(-1) on unamended plots. All treatments enhanced crop productivity and increased the uptake of nutrients into the maize grains. The CaSa compost was most effective in mitigating P deficiency and soil acidification. We conclude that all treatments are viable as a substitute for synthetic fertilizers. Nevertheless, further steps are required to integrate the tested soil amendments into farm-scale nutrient management and to balance the additions and removals of nutrients, so that the cycle can be closed.

To decrease the Cd uptake in fruit trees, three Cd-hyperaccumulator Solanum species (Solanum nigrum var. humile, Solanum americanum, and Solanum photeinocarpum) were intercropped with Amygdalus persica seedlings, and the effects of intercropping with Solanum species on the Cd and nutrient uptakes in A. persica were studied. Intercropping with S. nigrum var. humile increased the biomass of A. persica, while intercropping with S. americanum and S. photeinocarpum decreased that. Intercropping with A. persica increased the biomass of three Solanum species. Intercropping promoted the phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) uptakes in both A. persica and Solanum species. For Cd uptake, intercropping reduced the Cd uptake in A. persica and enhanced the Cd uptake and extraction in Solanum species. Correlation analysis showed that the Cd and K had antagonistic effect in aboveground of A. persica. Therefore, A. persica intercropped with Solanum species can reduce the Cd uptake in A. persica and improve the phytoremediation abilities of Solanum species, which is suitable for the Cd-contaminated peach orchard.

For this purpose three sugar beet varieties viz., Kaweterma, Aura and Pamela and four intercropping systems (sugar beet sole, sugar beet + wheat, sugar beet + barley, and sugar beet + lentil) were used. Sugar beet varieties planted as sole showed significantly higher values of all traits. Among the tested varieties, sole planting of sugar beet variety Kaweterma showed maximum leaf length, leaf area, leaves plant(-1), vertical diameter of beet, horizontal diameter of beet, beet root weight, beet yield, total dry matter, purity, Pol, brix, sugar recovery, N uptake and P uptake followed by Aura and Pamela when planted as sole. The intercropping of sugar beet with lentil produced second lowest values than sugar beet sole planting. However, wheat and barley intercropping produced minimum values of sugar beet. Maximum monetary benefits like higher gross revenue, input: output ratio, cost: benefit ratio and net returns were recorded when lentil crop was intercropped with sugar beet variety Kaweterma. It is concluded that sugar beet yields and consequently the monetary benefits were also higher in lentil intercropping as compared to cereals intercropping system.	"[Usmanikhail, M. U.; Tunio, S.

However, the magnitude of the benefits depends on the availability of such resources. To improve our understanding and design best-performing systems, we evaluated the performance and underlying mechanisms of a cereal-legume mixture on two crossed gradients of N and P. Methods In a pot experiment, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and white lupin (Lupinus albus L.) were grown separately or together on four levels of N combined with four levels of P. We compared biomass, N content, P content, shoot-to-root biomass ratios and white lupin production of cluster roots and nodules of sole crops with those of intercrops. We used the relative interaction intensity index to determine how the nature of the interaction between the two species changed along the two resource gradients. Results Regardless of N and P supply, combined biomass and N content of intercropped wheat and white lupin were 29% and 23% greater than those of sole crops, respectively. Intercropping increased P content by 34%, on average, particularly at the lowest P supply. While wheat benefited from intercropping in all treatments, white lupin's performances decreased with increasing N and P supply, resulting in a shift from mutualism to competition along the two gradients and compensation mechanisms between the two species. Conclusion Nutrient availability negatively influenced the nature and mechanisms of wheat-lupin interaction. However, we only observed mutualistic interactions under low resource supply, which led to the lowest production, while competition was associated with the most productive situations.

Production Potential of Pigeon Pea Based Intercropping Systems under Various Land Configurations in Marathwada Region of Maharashtra	LEGUME RESEARCH			English	Article						"Intercrops; Land configuration; Pigeonpea; Productivity; Yield attributes"	CAJANUS-CAJAN	Backround: Pigeon pea is suitable for intercropping with different crops like soybean, green gram, black gram and cowpea for increasing production, proper land utilization and maintaining soil fertility. The initial slow growth rate and deep root system of pigeon pea offers a good scope for intercropping with fast growing early maturing and shallow rooted crops. Abiotic stresses of dry land farming can be alleviated by effective moisture conservation practices. Considering these points an experiment was conducted to evaluate comparative performance of the pigeon pea based intercropping system with short durational legumes like soybean, green gram, black gram and cowpea under different land configurations. Methods: A field experiment was conducted at experimental farm of AICRP for Dryland Agriculture, V.N.M.KV, Parbhani during kharif season of 2015-16 and 2016-17 to study the production potential of pigeon pea based intercropping systems under various land configurations. The present investigation consisted of 12 treatment combinations comprising of three land configurations in main plot and four intercropping systems in sub plots. Result: Yield attributes and yield of intercrops was influenced significantly by different land configurations. In case of intercrops mean seed yield, mean number of pods plant(-1), weight of pods plant(-1), weight of seed plant(-1), number seeds pod(-1) and number of seeds plant(-1) found to be higher in broad bed furrow than ridges furrow and flatbed method. Similarly, higher seed yield, straw yield, biological yield, harvest index of pigeon pea and pigeon pea equivalent yield was recorded with Broad bed furrows followed ridges and furrow system. Among the intercropping systems, pigeon pea + green gram intercropping systems recorded maximum seed yield, straw yield, biological yield, harvest index of pigeon pea and pigeon pea equivalent yield than other intercropping systems.

A 2-year field experiment was conducted to determine the effects of different intercropping ratios and fertilizer types on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations and yields of fenugreek and buckwheat at the research farm of Shahrekord University, Iran. The treatments consisted of sole cropping of fenugreek (F), buckwheat (B) and three intercropping ratios (F:B = 1:2, 1:1 and 2:1) under three fertilizer types: chemical fertilizer (CF), integrated fertilizer (IF) and broiler litter (BL). At flowering and at harvest, intercropping increased total above-ground dry matter (TAGDM), total seed yield, N and P concentrations (plant) and uptake. The applied N use efficiency and applied N recovery efficiency (ANUE, ANRE) in the intercropped plots were also higher as compared to the sole cropping. The intercropping ratio of F:B (2:1) was the most suitable for improving the tested nutrient variables. The IF and BL showed significant benefits as compared to CF, for TAGDM, total seed yield, N-C and P-C in the plant, as well as N and P uptake in sole and intercrops. For ANUE and ANRE, CF proved to be more effective. This study showed that a 2:1 fenugreek-buckwheat intercropped system with the application of IF and BL can successfully be implemented for improving productivity, N and P contents of fenugreek and buckwheat as well as the nutrient land equivalent ratio (compared with sole cropping with CF) under semi-arid growing conditions.

Experiments were conducted in randomized blocks designed for two years. Species: common vetch (Vicia sativa L.), Hungarian vetch (Viciapannonica Crantz.), pea (Pisum sativum L.), and triticale (xTriticosecale Wittmack) all were pure sown and in legume triticale intercropping systems. According to data obtained from this research, the lowest values for investigated parameters were obtained from pure triticale treatment, and the values decreased with increasing triticale ratios in mixtures. In the legume species included in intercropping systems, the greatest dry matter yield of pure sowings was obtained from pea with 6.07 t ha(-1), and the greatest value of intercropping systems was obtained from pea triticale mixtures with 8.98-8.11 t ha(-1) Considering the forage quality of investigated treatments, Hungarian vetch and common vetch were found to be superior to pea. The lowest NDF and ADF values were obtained from pure Hungarian vetch treatments. The peak RYT values were obtained from including pea and 60:40 and 50:50 Hungarian vetch mixtures. In conclusion, when we consider forage yield, it was observed that pea was prominent among the legume species, and vetches were superior with regard to forage quality. In point of the significance level of both criteria in animal feeding, 60:40 and 50:50 Hungarian vetch mixture ratios could be recommended for similar ecologies.

Farmers on the Canadian prairies arc interested in including legume cover crops in their cropping systems to reduce fertilizer inputs and improve farm sustainability. A field study was conducted to determine the merits of establishing alfalfa (Medicago saliva L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) or Austrian winter pea (Pisum sativum L.) cover crops in fall or in spring with winter wheat (Macula aestivum L.). Spring-planted legumes emerged well within the winter wheat crop, but their growth was limited under these semi-arid conditions. Fall-planted red clover had low plant densities following winter in two of three experiments and fall-planted winter pea reduced winter wheat yield by 23 to 37% compared with the no cover crop control. In contrast, fall-planted alfalfa exhibited good winterhardiness, provided some weed suppression without reducing winter wheat yield, caused only a slight reduction in soil water content, and contributed an extra 18 to 20 kg ha(-1) of available soil N at the time of seeding the following spring crop. Additionally, fall-planted alfalfa increased the yield of succeeding canola (Brassica napus L.) in unfertilized plots in two of three experiments. Further research is warranted to better understand the agronomic and economic benefits of alfalfa-winter wheat intercrops under a wider range of environmental conditions.

J	"Thorsted, MD; Weiner, J; Olesen, JE"				"Thorsted, MD; Weiner, J; Olesen, JE"			Above- and below-ground competition between intercropped winter wheat Triticum aestivum and white clover Trifolium repens	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						"cereal; intercropping; legume; root competition; shoot competition"	"PEA-BARLEY INTERCROPS; NITROGEN AVAILABILITY; GRAIN-YIELD; CULTIVARS; SYSTEM; GROWTH; FORAGE; PLANTS"	1. Intercropping of white clover and cereals has recently been promoted for low-input farming systems because it offers several benefits for sustainability, but the practical use of this system has been limited by the relatively low wheat yields. Very little is known about competition between the two species in this intercropping system and its implications for production. 2. To investigate the interaction between white clover and wheat, we separated above- and below-ground competition in the field in a fully factorial additive design. The treatments were with and without clover, with and without below-ground partitions between rows of the two species, and with and without above-ground partitions. Above-ground biomass of both species was harvested three times over the growing season, and the wheat biomass was analysed for nitrogen content. 3. When wheat was grown without clover, its biomass was much reduced by below-ground partitions and slightly reduced by above-ground partitions. Presence of both above- and below-ground partitions did not result in lower wheat biomass than below-ground partitions alone. 4. Total biomass was higher when both species were present, and this biomass was reduced by below-ground partitions and, to a lesser degree, by above-ground partitions. In mixture, below-ground partitions reduced wheat biomass and increased clover biomass at the last harvest, whereas above-ground partitions reduced clover biomass and increased wheat biomass. 5. The interaction between the two species was dominated by competition for soil nutrients, but competition for light influenced the partitioning of biomass production between the two species. Mingling of the roots of both species is important for maximizing soil resource utilization, whereas shoots performed almost as well without mingling. 6. Synthesis and applications. The results suggest that competition between wheat and clover for nitrogen is reduced by nitrogen fixation because clover obtains some of its nitrogen from fixation. Increased availability of nitrogen to the intercropped wheat late in the growing season could increase grain protein content. Our results suggest possibilities for improved management of competition between the two species to optimize resource utilization, biomass production and wheat yields. Goals for yield should be based on a specific component, such as total biomass, grain yield and grain quality, because these yield components can behave differently when another species is present.

J	Banik, P				Banik, P			Evaluation of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and legume intercropping under 1:1 and 2:1 row-replacement series system	JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ACKER UND PFLANZENBAU			English	Article						"rice; legume; actual yield loss; intercropping advantage; economics"		A field experiment was conducted during the winter season of 1992-93 and 1993-94 at Agricultural Experimental Farm, Giridih, Bihar to evaluate the intercropping systems of legumes, gram (Cicer arietinum L.), pea (Pisum sativum) and lentil (Lens culinaris) with wheat (Triticum aestivum) in 1:1 and 2:1 'row replacement series'. Intercropping systems were assessed on the basis of new indices termed as actual yield loss (AYL) and intercropping advantage (IA). This paper highlights the comparative effectiveness of evaluating the intercropping systems through the existing intercropping indices like LER, RCC, aggressivity. The indices AYL and IA seem to be more appropriate particularly when per plant yield is considered. Intercropping reduced the yield of component crops compared with respective pure stands. Wheat + pea in 1:1 row replacement series gave the highest wheat yield equivalent value (3.02 t h(-1)) followed by wheat + lentil (2.91 t ha(-1)). When the actual sown proportion was considered wheat + lentil (1:1) resulted in maximum An (+0.610) and IA (+0.279) values. This treatment also gave the maximum monetary advantage (Rs 5985.45 ha(-1)).

The stands were grown in boxes in the field, and partitions were used to separate the effects of root and shoot interactions. The cereals and peas were either planted at the same time, or one species was planted 10 days before the other. The origin of the N present in each species was determined by applying N fertilizer labelled with N-15. Both cultivars of peas had greater shoot and root competitive abilities than wheat or barley, probably because of their larger seed size; leafy peas had greater shoot and root competitive abilities than semi-leafless peas. Sowing peas after cereals reduced their competitive ability. The relative yield total (RYT) of cereal-pea mixtures, based on total biomass, averaged 1.6 when only the root systems interacted, and 1.4 when only the shoot systems interacted, but did not differ significantly from 1.0 when both root and shoot systems interacted. RYT values were greater when peas were grown with wheat, rather than with barley, and when peas were sown at the same time as the cereals. Shoot competition from peas increased the N % of cereals, but substantially reduced their total N content, because biomass yield was reduced. Shoot competition from cereals had no effect on the N % of peas, and only slightly reduced their total N content. Shoot competition between cereals and peas had no significant effect upon the proportion of N derived from various sources by either cereals or peas. Root competition from peas significantly reduced both the N % and total N content of cereals. Root competition from cereals had little effect on the N % of peas, but significantly reduced their total N content and increased the proportion of N derived from rhizobial fixation from 76 to 94 %.

To assess the agricultural services of an intercropping system; durum wheat (Triticum turgidum durum L.cv. VITRON) and chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.cv. FLIP 90/13 C) were cultivated as both intercrops and sole cropping during two growing seasons under the field trial, to compare plant biomass, nodulation, N and phosphorus (P) uptake, and N nutrition index. Both the above-ground biomass and grain yield and consequently, the amount of N taken up by intercropped durum wheat increased significantly (44%, 48%, and 30%, respectively) compared with sole cropping during the two seasons. However, intercropping decreased P uptake by both durum wheat and chickpea. The efficiency in use of rhizobial symbiosis (EURS) for intercropped chickpea was significantly higher than for chickpea grown as sole cropping. The intercropped chickpea considerably increased N (49%) and P (75%) availability in durum wheat rhizosphere. In the case of chickpea shoot, the N nutrition (defined by the ratio between actual and critical N uptake by crop) and acquisition were higher in intercropping during only the first year of cropping. Moreover, biomass, grin yield, and resource (N and P) use efficiency were significantly improved, as indicated by higher land equivalent ratio (LER > 1) in intercropping over sole cropping treatments. Our findings suggest that change in the intercropped chickpea rhizosphere-induced parameters facilitated P and N uptake, above-ground biomass, grain yield, and land use efficiency for wheat crop."

Also critical is incorporating a range of viable options to handle potential short-term life system imbalances. This paper revisits sonic of the conceptual framework for a Mars base prototype which has been developed by the authors along with others previously advanced (Mars on Earth (R)) in the light of three years of experimentation in the Laboratory Biosphere, further investigation of system alternatives and the advent of other innovative engineering and agri-ecosystem approaches. Several experiments with candidate space agriculture crops have demonstrated the higher productivity possible with elevated light levels and improved environmental controls. For example, crops of sweet potatoes exceeded original Mars base prototype projections by an average f 46%, (53% for best crop) ultradwarf(Apogee) wheat by 9% (23% for best crop), pinto bean by 13%(31% for best crop). These production levels, although they may be increased with further optimization of lighting regimes, environmental parameters, crop density etc. offer-evideuce that I soil-based system can be as productive as the hydroponic systems which have dominated space life support scenarios and research. But soil also offers distinct advantages: the capability to be created oil the Moon or Mars using in situ space resources, reduces long-term reliance oil consumables and imported resources, and more readily recycling and incorporating crew and crop waste products. In addition, a living soil contains a complex microbial ecosystem which helps prevent the buildup of trace gases or compounds, and thus assist with air and water purification. The atmospheric dynamics of these crops were Studied in the Laboratory Biosphere adding to the database necessary for managing the mixed stands of crops essential for supplying a nutritionally adequate diet in space. This paper explores some of the challenges of small bioregenerative life support: air-sealing and facility architecture/design, balance of short-term variations of carbon dioxide and oxygen through staggered plantings, options for additional atmospheric buffers and sinks, lighting/energy efficiency engineering, crop and waste product recycling approaches, and human factor considerations in the design and operation of a Mars base. An Earth to Mars project, forging the ability to live sustainably in space (as on Earth) requires continued research and testing of these components and integrated subsystems; and developing a step-by-step learning process.

Drought-tolerant Desmodium species effectively suppress parasitic striga weed and improve cereal grain yields in western Kenya	CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						"Striga; Climate change; Desmodium; Drought-tolerance; Agricultural productivity"	"ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; ROOT EXUDATE; HERMONTHICA; SORGHUM; MANAGEMENT; RESISTANCE; MAIZE; SPP.; AGRICULTURE; INTERCROPS"	The parasitic weed Striga hermonthica Benth. (Orobanchaceae), commonly known as striga, is an increasingly important constraint to cereal production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), often resulting in total yield losses in maize (Zea mays L) and substantial losses in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L) Moench). This is further aggravated by soil degradation and drought conditions that are gradually becoming widespread in SSA. Forage legumes in the genus Desmodium (Fabaceae), mainly D. uncinatum and D. intortum, effectively control striga and improve crop productivity in SSA. However, negative effects of climate change such as drought stress is affecting the functioning of these systems. There is thus a need to identify and characterize new plants possessing the required ecological chemistry to protect crops against the biotic stress of striga under such environmental conditions. 17 accessions comprising 10 species of Desmodium were screened for their drought stress tolerance and ability to suppress striga. Desmodium incanum and D. ramosissimum were selected as the most promising species as they retained their leaves and maintained leaf function for longer periods during their exposure to drought stress conditions. They also had desirable phenotypes with more above ground biomass. The two species suppressed striga infestation, both under controlled and field conditions, and resulted in significant grain yield increases, demonstrating the incremental capability of Desmodium species in striga suppression. These results demonstrate beneficial effects of Desmodium species in enhancing cereal productivity in dry areas. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.	"[Midega, Charles A.

Establishing Native Perennial Bioenergy Crops with Cereal Grain Companion Crops	BIOENERGY RESEARCH			English	Article						"Bioenergy; Biofuels; Prairie; Intercropping; Companion crops; Switchgrass"	"PLANT-SPECIES RICHNESS; BIOFUEL CROPS; DIVERSITY; INVASION; BARLEY; BIODIVERSITY; SWITCHGRASS; NITROGEN; BIOMASS; CARBON"	"Companion crops supply additional economic returns when used to establish perennial forage crops, and they should provide similar benefits when establishing native perennial grasslands for bioenergy. We evaluated the effect of cereal grains and native perennial companion crops on biomass yield of three different bioenergy crop types (switchgrass (Panicum virgatum (L.) Vitman) monoculture, four-species native grass mixture, and CP-25 polyculture mixture) during the seeding year and two subsequent harvest years at four environments. Effects of companion crops on bioenergy crop yields were inconsistent across locations and time, but some general patterns were observed. Averaged across all bioenergy crops, three companion cropping treatments-oat (Avena sativa L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis L.) harvested for forage-produced harvestable biomass during the seeding year while suppressing weeds and maintaining perennial biomass yield of the main crop during the first harvest year. Harvestable forage yields were greater for the oat companion crop compared to Canada wildrye during the seeding year at two environments, which could make the cereal grain companion crops more profitable for producers, depending on biomass markets. The polyculture crop yielded 33 and 39 % more perennial biomass than the switchgrass and grass mix in one environment and had 25 % less weed biomass compared to switchgrass in another. No individual companion crop/bioenergy crop combination consistently yielded more perennial biomass or less weed biomass compared to unweeded controls across all environments; however, companion crops can supply marketable grain and biomass during the seeding year when planted with native perennial grasslands without decreasing perennial biomass yields in subsequent harvest years."

(L.) Merr.], and how changes in the FD are related to changes in other canopy characteristics. Plants in monocropped corn and intercropped corn-soybean plots were randomly sampled and labelled for later identification. Corn plant structure was photographed from the side that allowed the maximum appearance of details (perpendicular to the plane of developed leaves) and from two fixed sides (side 1: parallel to the row and side 2: perpendicular to the row). Images were scanned and skeletonized, as skeletal images provide acceptable information to estimate the FD of plant structure two-dimensionally by the box-counting method. Differences in the FD estimated from images taken perpendicular to the plane of developed leaves were not significant among competition treatments. An adjustment of corn plants to treatments, by changing the orientation of the plane of developed leaves with respect to the row, was observed. Based on overall FD means, competition treatments were ranked as: high > normal approximate to intercrop approximate to low for side 1 and intercrop > low approximate to normal > high for side 2. Leaf area index (LAI) and plant height had a positive correlation with FD. In contrast, light penetration had a negative correlation with FD. In conclusion, FD provides a meaningful and effective tool for quantifying corn plant structure, measuring the structural response to cultural practices, and modelling corn plant canopies.

The treatments were: 1) oat, annual ryegrass, and supplement (GS), 2) oat, annual ryegrass, and vetch (GL), 3) oat, annual ryegrass, vetch, and supplement (GLS). Supplementation of ground maize was given daily at 11 h at 1% of body weight. Total digestible nutrient intake was higher in steers fed GS and GLS. Animals on GL ingested higher concentrations of nitrogen (N) compared to animals on GS and GLS diets. Ruminal pH and ammonia concentration were higher in GL. Grass-legume mixtures and supplements showed higher concentrations of sugar, alpha-amino acids, and peptides. The ruminal fermentative parameters, ruminal pH, ammonia, and sugars ranged cubically across the day. Microbial protein synthesis was similar amongst the treatments. Animals exclusively consuming temperate grass produce higher ruminal pH and ammonia concentrations. Therefore, using temperate legumes in pasture systems can be included in the cattle diet in lieu of utilizing energy supplements.

This study was conducted to collect baseline data about the activities of local people in the agro-ecosystem of Pothwar plateau, Pakistan through a questionnaire survey. Information reported by the selected 94 farmers revealed that wheat intercropped with mustard is a major crop cultivated in this region followed by groundnut and maize. Livestock grazing is common with goat most popularly reared. Cutting, harvesting (for fuel wood/animal feed) and burning of field boundary vegetation is not a common practice in Pothwar plateau. Agro-chemicals are used by 72% farmers to enhance crop yield. Except rodent pests of groundnut, the prevalence of pests and diseases was low in the study area. Consequently, few farmers employed chemical methods of pest control. Manual weeding is popular in the region. Environment education and awareness of local people about biodiversity and wildlife conservation is low and hunting is a common practice. This study generated useful baseline information that could be employed with other research studies for developing biodiversity conservation strategy in this agro-ecosystem.

Seven regions of Portugal were explored from the north to the south. A diverse range of habitats was sampled covering different altitudes, management systems and ecological conditions, where semi-natural grassland and wild unmanaged grassland was found. Vegetative samples of forage grass and legume populations were collected wherever possible. Seed samples were collected in the absence of live plants and from farmers' stores. Detailed collection site data was recorded at every site. 113 populations of Lolium spp., Festuca spp., Agrostis spp., Dactylis spp. and Briza spp. and 53 populations of Trifolium spp., Medicago spp. and Lupinus spp. were collected from 115 sites. It was possible to find traditional agricultural systems throughout Portugal but they are changing in response to European Union farming policies. For example, Lolium multiflorum Lam. is still intercropped with maize, although seed production of this crop on the farm is no longer permissible and, therefore, local land races are being replaced by commercial varieties. These changes to traditional agricultural systems are contributing to a major loss of genetic diversity.

Influence of cropping systems on combining ability and gene action for grain yield and its components in blackgram (Vigna mungo)	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						"Blackgram; Cropping system; Combining ability; Gene action; Intercropping"		Field experiments were conducted at Regional Research Station, Himachal Pradesh Agricultural University, Palampur during rainy (kharif) season of 2003-04 and 2004-05 to study the effect of cropping system on the nature and magnitude of gene action for seed yield and its component traits in the parents and progenies of linextester cross in blackgram [Vigna mungo (L.) Hepper], grown both as a sole crop and intercrop with maize (Zea mays L.). There was not much effect of cropping system in the manifestation of phenotypic and genotypic variability. There were strong progeniesxcropping system interactions for different traits. Cropping system had a large influence on the phenotypic expression of yield and its components. Both additive (sigma 2A) and non-additive (sigma 2D) genetic variances were important in the genetic determination of seed yield and its components. However, the ratio of sigma(2)A to sigma(2)D was greater under monoculture than under intercropping for almost all the traits except harvest index, seeds/pod, pods/plant and days to 50% flowering, where it increased indicating that cropping systems influence the genetic control of important yield component traits. However, the occurrence of low genotypic correlations for seed yield and its components across and cropping systems justify the selection of different parents and crosses for monoculture and in association with blackgram.

Production and Soil Responses to Intercropping of Forage Grasses with Corn and Soybean Silage	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							"GRAIN-YIELD; NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; MAIZE; DECOMPOSITION; PALISADEGRASS; REVENUE; SYSTEM; REGION; CROPS"	Agricultural management systems are needed to simultaneously enhance production, and improve soil quality. We investigated the effects of intercropped grass on production of corn (Zea mays L.) harvested for silage at 0.20 and 0.45 m height in the summer, as well as on production of subsequent forage, silage soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], and soil responses on a Typic Haplorthox in Botucatu, SP, Brazil. Palisade grass [Urochloa brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich.) R. Webster 'Marandu'] was the introduced companion crop with corn (Years 1 and 2), while signal grass [Urochloa decumbens (Stapf) R. Webster 'Basilisk'] was the residual weedy species in comparison. Guinea grass [Urochloa maxima (Jacq.) R. Webster 'Aruana'] was the introduced companion crop with soybean (Year 3), with only a residual effect of crop systems from the previous 2 yr. When cut at 0.45 m compared with 0.20 m height, corn intercropped with palisade grass had greater leaf nutrient concentrations, agronomic characteristics, forage mass of pasture for grazing by lambs (Ovis aries), greater surface mulch produced, and greater quantity of N, P, and K returned to soil. Greater soil organic matter, P, K, and Mg concentration, and base saturation in the surface soil depth and lower soil penetration resistance at all depths occurred at 0.45 m than at 0.20 m corn silage cutting height intercropped with palisade grass. Analyzing the system as a whole, harvesting corn silage crop with palisade grass intercrop at 0.45 m height was the most viable option in this integrated crop-livestock system (ICLS).

J	Olasantan, FO				Olasantan, FO			Tropical vegetables and spices: potential value and contributions to sustainable agriculture in Nigeria	OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE			English	Article							"OKRA ABELMOSCHUS-ESCULENTUS; MAIZE ZEA-MAYS; NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION; INTERCROPPED CASSAVA; CROPPING SYSTEMS; LEAFY VEGETABLES; EGUSI-MELON; SOIL; ALFISOL; COWPEA"	Tropical vegetables and spices have an important contribution to make to sustainable agricultural development in Nigeria. A high proportion of these plants are cultivated, mainly in mixtures under rainfed conditions, and they are significant assets for farmers and society as a whole. They are conserved for use by people as food, medicines, fuel, fodder and building and industrial materials, contributing to the ecophysiology and biodiversity of mixed systems. But, despite these valuable attributes, current levels of productivity are well below those necessary to help create a strong, healthy Nigerian economy, and there is limited research work on their production in mixed systems. Improvements in their productivity will depend on increased efficiency in the conservation and use of these plants, targeting the smallholders, wider use of appropriate improved technologies at farm level, and greater attention to their ecophysiological values. Agricultural research aimed at these specific areas is essential for sustainable agricultural development in the country. Implications for future research in plant breeding and agronomy are highlighted.

Yields, Resource Utilization Efficiency, and Soil Health	AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Article						"soil enzymes; baby corn; intercropping; legumes; soil respiration; microbial biomass carbon"	"DRY-MATTER; COMPETITION; GROWTH; MAIZE"	The study was carried out at the Experimental Farm of the Indian Statistical Institute, Giridih, India during the winter seasons of 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 in a split-plot design with three replications. Four legume species (chickpea, pea, groundnut, and lentil) were intercropped with baby corn (Zea mays L.) in 2:1 and 2:2 row arrangements in an additive series besides their sole stand in main-plots and three weeding (no-, one-, and two-weedings) treatments in subplots. Sole baby corn and legumes produced higher economic and by-product yields than their intercropping system. The yield of baby corn declined by 5-14.4% and that of legumes by 8.3-44% when they were grown in association. Intercropping systems had higher baby corn equivalent yield, land use efficiency (28.9-47.2%), area-time efficiency (2.7-15.3%), and monetary advantages, especially in 2:2 row ratios. Baby corn + pea (2:2) followed by baby corn + chickpea (2:2) seemed to be the best intercropping systems in terms of yield advantages and economic returns. Weeding increased yields by reducing competition and yield losses thereby increasing land efficiency and productivity. Intercropping improved soil health measured in terms of NPK, organic carbon, cation exchange capacity, soil enzymes, microbial respiration, and microbial biomass carbon.

The experiments were carried out in the same field for two consecutive years during 2012-13 and 2013-14 on wheat-cotton with different relay/intercropping system. Wheat was sown in strips in November and harvested in April of the next year, while cotton was sown in the interspersed space of wheat crop in early March and harvested before the next wheat sowing in November. There were six different planting systems of wheat and cotton i.e. P-1 (wheat 6 rows strips between 150 cm apart ridges + cotton on ridges-single row), P-2 (wheat 6 rows strips between 150 cm apart ridges + cotton on ridges double row), P-3 (Wheat 2 rows strips between 75 cm apart ridges + cotton on ridges single row), P-4 (wheat in 3 rows strips on 75 cm wide beds and cotton dibbling on both sides of beds, P-5 (wheat after cotton as alone crops) and P-6 (Bt-cotton alone early on beds) were used in the experiment. The experiments were laid out in randomized complete blocks design and data regarding crop productivity and profitability of mono and intercrops were collected. The treatment P-2 (6: 2) gave 38% higher income and produce maximum BCR (1.92) than early sown alone Bt cotton and proved very successful for relay cropping of cotton in standing wheat crop as wheat yield was not reduced and additional cotton produce was obtained normally.

The comparisons were of 0 and 2.5 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) FYM applied in Niger, and of 0 and 5 Mg ha(-1) FYM applied once in 2 years in Burkina Faso. Fertilizer and FYM application alone had little effect on yield in Niger but there was a synergistic effect of fertilizer P with FYM which included increased mean responses to P of, respectively: 0.22 and 0.43 Mg ha(-1) for sorghum grain and fodder (Sorghum bicolor L.); 0.15 and 0.27 Mg ha(-1) for cowpea grain and fodder; 0.16 Mg ha(-1) grain for pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.) when intercropped with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.); and 0.39 Mg ha(-1) for groundnut fodder (Arachis hypogea L.). Application of FYM increased pearl millet response to N but decreased legume response to K fertilizer. In Burkina Faso, there was a mean grain yield increase of 0.29 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) due to FYM and the effect of applying both FYM and fertilizer was additive except for a synergy of N fertilizer plus manure application for maize (Zea mays L.).

Naked cultivars of barley and oat were used. The three-year field experiment was conducted at the Agricultural Advisory Centre in Szepietowo, Poland. The study showed that the major factor determining yields of the mixtures was soil quality. Within the better soil (Albic Luvisols), the highest yield was achieved by a mixture of covered barley and wheat and by a mixture of covered barley with covered oats and wheat, but only in treatments with lower sowing density. Moreover, on the better soil, significantly higher protein yields were obtained for mixtures of barley (covered or naked grains) with wheat as compared to the mixture of covered barley with covered oats, or the mixture of covered barley with naked oats and wheat. The highest yields of net metabolic energy, regardless of soil type, were obtained from a mixture of naked barley with wheat, while the lowest from a mixture of covered barley with naked oats and wheat. Mixed sowings increase biodiversity of canopies, which allows a better use of production space. They also increase health and the productivity of plants.

Intercropping winter cereals in Kura clover for spring forage production	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						"forage nutritive value; rye; Trifolium ambiguum; triticale; wheat"	"WHEAT TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; LEGUME COVER CROPS; DRY-MATTER YIELD; NUTRITIVE-VALUE; GRAIN-YIELD; AGRONOMIC PERFORMANCE; LIVING MULCHES; MIXTURES; QUALITY; OAT"	Intercropping winter cereals into Kura clover (Trifolium ambiguum M. Bieb.) has the potential to improve forage nutritive value without reducing yields. The objective of this research was to compare forage yield and nutritive value of cereal-legume mixtures to cereals or Kura clover grown in monoculture and harvested at two different maturity stages in spring. Winter rye (Secale cereale L.), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and winter triticale (xTriticosecale Wittmack) were sown in autumn at two locations as monocultures and into herbicide suppressed and non-suppressed Kura clover and harvested for forage the following spring. Harvested at the cereal crop boot stage at Arlington, forage yields averaged 4.7, 4.8, 5.3, and 1.7 Mg ha(-1) and 3.5, 3.7, 4.1, and 2.6 Mg ha(-1) at Lancaster for mixtures with non-suppressed Kura clover, suppressed Kura clover, monoculture cereals, and monoculture clover, respectively. At the milk stage, yields across all mixture treatments increased by 46% to 115% compared to the boot stage at Arlington and by 88% to 101% at Lancaster. Kura clover in mixtures increased crude protein by 34% to 46% and in vitro true digestibility by 3% to 6%, neutral detergent fiber digestibility by 0% to 6%, and reduced neutral detergent fiber concentration by 8% to 18% relative to cereal monocultures. The nutritive value of mixtures and monoculture Kura clover was always greater than that of monoculture cereals. Winter cereals can be successfully managed with Kura clover for forage production by maximizing nutritive value with boot stage harvests or achieving higher yields by harvesting at the milk stage.

The following crops were used for silage production: triticale (X. Triticosecale Wittimack), triticale intercropped with forage pea (Pisum arvense) and triticale intercropped with oats (Avena strigosa Schreb), forage pea and vetch (Vicia sativa). The dry matter content and its recovery did not differ among the silages. Buffer capacity was higher for tricale silage intercropped with oats, forage pea and vetch (88.67 m eq. NaOH/100 g DM) followed by triticale intercropped with forage pea (80.80 m eq. NaOH/100 g DM). Electric conductivity values were higher in the intercropped triticale silages. Triticale silage presented the lowest temperatures observed in the silos, and the silages of intercropped triticale silages presented higher heat retention and higher pH values. Silage of triticale intercropped with oats and legumes presented lower aerobic stability but it did not reduce the aerobic stability of the total feed. Dry matter recovery during storage and in stability evaluations in aerobiosis is similar among the silages.

Total biomass production and N use at two levels of N fertilisation (0.5 and 4.0 g N/m(2)), were measured at five harvests throughout a growing season. All intercrops displayed land equivalent ratio values close to or exceeding unity, indicating complementary use of growth resources. Whereas both rape and barley responded positively to increased N fertilisation, irrespective of whether they were grown as sole- or intercrops, pea was strongly suppressed when grown in intercrop. Of the three crops barley was the strongest competitor for both soil and fertiliser N, rape intermediate and pea the weakest. Faster initial growth of barley than pea and rape gave barley an initial competitive advantage, an advantage that in the two dual intercrops was strengthened by the addition of N. Apparently the competitive superiority of barley was less strong in the tri-component intercrop, indicating that the impact of the dominant may, through improved growth of both rape and pea, have been diminished through indirect facilitation. Interspecific competition had a promoting effect on the percent of nitrogen derived from N-2 fixation of pea, and most so at the low N fertilisation level. Results indicate that the benefits achieved from the association of a legume and nonlegume, in terms of N-2 fixed were greatest when pea was grown in association with rape as opposed to barley which could indicate that the benefits achieved from the association of a legume and nonlegume are partly lost if the nonlegume is too strong a competitor.

In this study, the rhizosphere fungal communities of sugarcane and soybean under monoculture and intercropping systems were investigated using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of ITS gene. Intercropping decreased the alpha-diversity and changed fungal community composition compared to monocultures. Taxonomic analyses showed that the dominant phyla were Ascomycota, Zygomycota and Basidiomycota. The abundance of Ascomycota decreased in intercropping sugarcane-grown soil compared to monoculture, while it increased in soybean-grown soil in the intercropping system. In addition, intercropping increased the abundance of important fungal genera, such as Trichoderma, Hypocreales and Fusarium but decreased the relative abundance of Gibberella and Chaetomium. The results of canonical correspondence analysis and automatic linear modelling indicated that fungal community compositions were closely associated with soil parameters such as total nitrogen (TN), soil organic matter (SOC), pH and NO3-, which suggests that the impacts of intercropping on the soil fungal community are linked to the alteration of soil chemical properties.

Here, we review studies of overyielding observed in agricultural intercropping systems, and show that a potentially important mechanism underlying such facilitation is the ability of some crop species to chemically mobilize otherwise-unavailable forms of one or more limiting soil nutrients such as phosphorus (P) and micronutrients (iron (Fe), zinc (Zn) and manganese (Mn)). Phosphorus-mobilizing crop species improve P nutrition for themselves and neighboring non-P-mobilizing species by releasing acid phosphatases, protons and/or carboxylates into the rhizosphere which increases the concentration of soluble inorganic P in soil. Similarly, on calcareous soils with a very low availability of Fe and Zn, Fe-and Zn-mobilizing species, such as graminaceous monocotyledonous and cluster-rooted species, benefit themselves, and also reduce Fe or Zn deficiency in neighboring species, by releasing chelating substances. Based on this review, we hypothesize that mobilization-based facilitative interactions may be an unsuspected, but potentially important mechanism enhancing productivity in both natural ecosystems and biodiversity experiments. We discuss cases in which nutrient mobilization might be occurring in natural ecosystems, and suggest that the nutrient mobilization hypothesis merits formal testing in natural ecosystems.

The noctuid stemborers are indigenous to Africa while C. partellus is an introduced species from Asia. In 1999, the Asian stemborer parasitoid, Cotesia flavipes Cameron (Braconidae) was found to be widespread in Ethiopia, even though it had never been released in the country. In addition to attacking Chilo partellus, Cotesia flavipes was reared from B. fusca and S. calamistis. The origin of C. flavipes in Ethiopia may have been Somalia where it was released in 1997 near the border with eastern Ethiopia. Percent parasitism of borers by C. flavipes was higher in eastern Ethiopia than other surveyed regions, and parasitism was higher in 2000 than 1999. Parasitism was higher when cereals were intercropped with other plants and when wild grass hosts of stemborers were present.

Protective effects of a wheat cultivar mixture against splash-dispersed septoria tritici blotch epidemics	PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						"cultivar mixtures; disease resistance; Mycosphaerella graminicola; septoria tritici blotch; splash dispersal; wheat"	"SPECIALIZED FUNGAL PATHOGENS; INTRASPECIFIC MIXED STANDS; WINTER-WHEAT; MYCOSPHAERELLA-GRAMINICOLA; MULTILINE CULTIVARS; CEREAL CULTIVARS; DISEASE PROGRESS; LEAF BLOTCH; STRIPE RUST; RESISTANCE"	The use of cultivar mixtures to control foliar fungal diseases is well documented for windborne diseases, but remains controversial for splash-dispersed diseases. To try to improve this strategy, a cultivar mixture was designed consisting of two wheat cultivars with contrasted resistance to Mycosphaerella graminicola, responsible for the rainborne disease septoria tritici blotch (STB), in a 1:3 susceptible:resistant ratio rather than the 1:1 ratio commonly used in previous studies. The impact of natural STB epidemics in this cultivar mixture was studied in field experiments over 4years. Weekly assessments of the number of sporulating lesions, pycnidial leaf area and green leaf area were carried out on the susceptible cultivar. In years with sufficient STB pressure, disease impacts on the susceptible cultivar in the mixture were always significantly lower than in the pure stand (e.g. 42% reduction of pycnidial leaf area for the three upper leaves in 2008 and 41% in 2009). In years with low STB pressure (2010 and 2011), a reduction of disease impacts was also shown but was not always significant. After major rainfall events, the number of sporulating lesions observed on the susceptible cultivar after one latent period was reduced on average by 45% in the mixture compared to the pure stand. All the measurements showed that a susceptible cultivar was consistently protected, at least moderately, in a mixture under low to moderate STB pressure.

Nonetheless, effective nonchemical weed management practices are adopted by several Sub-Saharan farmers, and may foster ecological intensification and agroecological crop management in the region. Ecological Weed Management (EWM) is a combination of methods aimed to achieve long-term weed suppression through the use of ecological interactions between crop, weeds, soil and/or other taxa fostered by appropriate agroecosystem management, with the least possible use of direct weed control methods, chemical or non chemical. The opportunities offered by EWM in Sub-Saharan Africa are synthesized based on results of a comprehensive literature review. Ecological Weed Management of Striga spp., emblematic parasitic weeds in the area, is treated in details showing that effective methods exist and often work better when combined. These methods include, e.g., the development of cultivars resistant or tolerant of infection, improved crop rotations, cover crops, intercrops andmulches, other soil-based positive interactions, and biocontrol via use of pathogenic fungi. Strategies including functional biodiversity-based methods are expected to foster EWM and overall agroecological crop management in the region. EWM methods can support other agroecosystem services (e.g., soil fertility) and at the same time be improved by methods aiming at other services (e.g., push-pull strategies against maize cob borers). Transdisciplinary collaboration and scientists' engagement in participatory research and action with farmers and other stakeholders would be instrumental to facilitate broader adoption of EWM in Sub-Saharan Africa.

The scale dependency of spatial crop species diversity and its relation to temporal diversity	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						"agrobiodiversity; temporal diversity; crop rotation; spatial scale"	"ANNUAL INTERCROPS; DIVERSIFICATION; ROTATION; CORN; AGROBIODIVERSITY; INTENSIFICATION; BIODIVERSITY; AGRICULTURE; DIMENSIONS; STRATEGIES"	Increasing crop species diversity can enhance agricultural sustainability, but the scale dependency of the processes that shape diversity and of the effects of diversity on agroecosystems is insufficiently understood. We used 30 m spatial resolution crop classification data for the conterminous United States to analyze spatial and temporal crop species diversity and their relationship. We found that the US average temporal (crop rotation) diversity is 2.1 effective number of species and that a crop's average temporal diversity is lowest for common crops. Spatial diversity monotonically increases with the size of the unit of observation, and it is most strongly associated with temporal diversity when measured for areas of 100 to 400 ha, which is the typical US farm size. The association between diversity in space and time weakens as data are aggregated over larger areas because of the increasing diversity among farms, but at intermediate aggregation levels (counties) it is possible to estimate temporal diversity and farm-scale spatial diversity from aggregated spatial crop diversity data if the effect of beta diversity is considered. For larger areas, the diversity among farms is usually much greater than the diversity within them, and this needs to be considered when analyzing large-area crop diversity data. US agriculture is dominated by a few major annual crops (maize, soybean, wheat) that are mostly grown on fields with a very low temporal diversity. To increase crop species diversity, currently minor crops would have to increase in area at the expense of these major crops.

Crop simulation models can complement field experiments to assess the agronomic and environmental performances of intercropping systems under diverse climatic conditions, including hypothetical future climate. So far, crop models that can handle intercropping, such as STICS, have not often been extensively evaluated for tropical conditions and for species grown by farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the calibrated STICS model to simulate sorghum-cowpea intercropping systems in rainfed conditions in West Africa. We used data from field experiments conducted at the N'Tarla Agronomic Station in Mali in 2017 and 2018. Two varieties of sorghum (local and improved) with contrasting photoperiod sensitivities were grown as sole crop and intercropped with cowpea, with additive design. Two sowing dates and two levels of mineral fertilization were also investigated. Model simulations were evaluated with observed data for phenology, leaf area index (LAI), aboveground biomass, grain yield and in-season soil moisture. Large variations in aboveground biomass of sorghum and cowpea was observed in the experiment (i.e. 3.5 - 9.6 t/ha for sorghum and 0.4-2.5 t/ha for cowpea), owing to the treatments (i.e. sole vs intercrop, early vs late sowing, no fertilizer input vs fertilizer input). Such variations were satisfactorily reproduced by the model, with EF of 0.81 in calibration and 0.58 in evaluation (with relative rRMSE of 23 % and 43 %) across crops. Sorghum AGB simulations were more accurate (rRMSE of 21 % and EF of 0.54) than cowpea AGB simulations (rRMSE of 25 % and EF of -0.09). The two main observed features of the intercropping system were well reproduced by the model. Firstly, cowpea and sorghum aboveground biomass decreased with intercropping compared with sole cropping, and the decrease in cowpea biomass was greater than the decrease in sorghum biomass. Secondly, despite a reduction in sorghum and cowpea yield, Land Equivalent Ratio of the intercropping for aboveground biomass was always above one. With regard to grain yield, observed LER was above one only in the non-fertilized treatment. The model failed at reproducing this behavior, probably because of insufficiently accurate calibration of the process leading to grain yield formation: rRMSE for grain yield was 49 % in calibration and 41 % in evaluation. Based on these findings, we discuss avenues to improve model calibration and use the model to explore options for sustainable intensification in land constrained sub-Saharan Africa.

Consequently, the outcome of its deployment in cultivar mixtures is not easy to predict, as on the one hand it may reduce the heterogeneity of the mixture, but on the other it may induce competition between nonspecialized strains of the pathogen. To clarify the principles for the successful use of quantitative plant resistance in disease management, we built a parsimonious model describing the dynamics of competing pathogen strains spreading through a mixture of cultivars carrying nonspecific quantitative resistance. Using the parameterized model for a wheat-yellow rust system, we demonstrate that a more effective use of quantitative resistance in mixtures involves reinforcing the effect of the highly resistant cultivars rather than replacing them. We highlight the fact that the judicious deployment of the quantitative resistance in two- or three-component mixtures makes it possible to reduce disease severity using only small proportions of the highly resistant cultivar. Our results provide insights into the effects on pathogen dynamics of deploying quantitative plant resistance, and can provide guidance for choosing appropriate associations of cultivars and optimizing diversification strategies.

E. Smith) has rapidly spread in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and has emerged as a major pest of maize and sorghum in the continent. For effective monitoring and a better understanding of the bioecology and management of this pest, a Community-based Fall Armyworm Monitoring, Forecasting, Early Warning and Management (CBFAMFEW) initiative was implemented in six eastern African countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi). Over 650 Community Focal Persons (CFPs) who received training through the project were involved in data collection on adult moths, crop phenology, cropping systems, FAW management practices and other variables. Data collection was performed using Fall Armyworm Monitoring and Early Warning System (FAMEWS), a mobile application developed by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. Data collected from the CBFAMFEW initiative in East Africa and other FAW monitoring efforts in Africa were merged and analysed to determine the factors that are related to FAW population dynamics. We used the negative binomial models to test for effect of main crops type, cropping systems and crop phenology on abundance of FAW. We also analysed the effect of rainfall and the spatial and temporal distribution of FAW populations. The study showed variability across the region in terms of the proportion of main crops, cropping systems, diversity of crops used in rotation, and control methods that impact on trap and larval counts. Intercropping and crop rotation had incident rate 2-times and 3-times higher relative to seasonal cropping, respectively. The abundance of FAW adult and larval infestation significantly varied with crop phenology, with infestation being high at the vegetative and reproductive stages of the crop, and low at maturity stage. This study provides an understanding on FAW bioecology, which could be vital in guiding the deployment of FAW-IPM tools in specific locations and at a specific crop developmental stage. The outcomes demonstrate the relevance of community-based crop pest monitoring for awareness creation among smallholder farmers in SSA.

Therefore, it is an urgent need to determine the threshold light intensity to ensure sustainable soybean production under these systems. An integrated approach combining morphology, physiology, biochemistry and genetic analysis was undertaken to study the light intensity effects on soybean growth and development. A pot experiment was set up in a growth chamber under increasing light intensity treatments of 100 (L-100), 200 (L-200), 300 (L-300), 400 (L-400), and 500 (L-500) mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Compared with L-100, plant height, hypocotyl length, and abaxial leaf petiole angle were decreased, biomass, root:shoot ratio, and stem diameter were increased, extremum was almost observed in L-400 and L-500. Leaf petiole movement and leaf hyponasty in each treatment has presented a tendency to decrease the leaf angle from L-500 to L-100. In addition, the cytochrome content (Chl a, Chl b, Car), net photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll fluorescence values of F-v/F-m, F-v'/F-m', ETR, Phi(PSII), and qP were increased as the light intensity increased, and higher values were noted under L-400. Leaf microstructure and chloroplast ultrastructure positively improved with increasing light intensity, and leaf-thickness, palisade, and spongy tissues-thickness were increased by 105, 90, and 370%, under L-500 than L-100. Moreover, the cross-sectional area of chloroplast (C) outer membrane and starch grains (S), and sectional area ratio (S:C) was highest under L-400 and L-500, respectively. Compared to L-100, the content of starch granules increased by 35.5, 122.0, 157.6, and 145.5%, respectively in L-400. The same trends were observed in the enzyme activity of sucrose-synthase, sucrose phosphate synthase, starch synthase, rubisco, phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase, and phosphoenol pyruvate phosphatase. Furthermore, sucrose synthesis-related genes were also up-regulated by increasing light intensity, and the highest seed yield and yield related parameters were recorded in the L-400. Overall, these results suggested that 400 and 500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) is the optimum light intensity which positively changed the leaf orientation and adjusts leaf angle to perpendicular to coming light, consequently, soybean plants grow well under prevailing conditions.

Common vetch-oat intercropping is used on the QTP and in other alpine regions to obtain substantial forage yield, but few common vetch cultivars have been evaluated in intercropping systems. A three-year field experiment in the eastern QTP was carried out to compare plant growth, photosynthetic rate (Pn), radiation use efficiency (RUE), aboveground biomass, land equivalent ratio (LER), and competition ratio of oat row intercropping with three new common vetch cultivars (Lanjian No. 1, Lanjian No. 2, Lanjian No. 3) under low-input conditions. Compared to sole cropping at seed densities of 141 and 667 plants m(-2), for common vetches and oats, respectively, alternate row intercropping with each species at half these densities significantly increased the Pn (by 15-19%) of oat, and reduced the Pn (by 12-26%) of common vetch. Moreover, row intercropping significantly increased intercepted photosynthetically active radiation and RUE (by 44%) for oat but significantly decreased these for common vetch (by 34%). Among common vetch cultivars, at both flowering and maturity stages, Lanjian No. 2 (1.21, 1.15) and Lanjian No. 3 (1.27, 1.21) had greater LER than the latermaturing Lanjian No. 1 (1.07, 1.01) when intercropped. Oat row intercropping with Lanjian No. 2 and Lanjian No. 3 increased forage production compared to sole cropping oat or common vetch on the QTP. These findings provide scientific support for common vetch-oat intercropping as a sustainable approach to increasing forage production from cropland in alpine regions.

The plant height was significantly increased with Si and intercropping+Si. The stalk diameter and stalk fresh weight were significantly enhanced with intercropping, Si application and intercropping+Si, except with intercropping in 2013. The yield, brix, pol, sucrose, and purity were remarkably increased, but reducing sugar and fiber content were significantly decreased with intercropping, Si application and intercropping+Si. Soil organic carbon (SOC), soil phosphorus (P), soil potassium (K), and soil Si content were enhanced with intercropping, Si application and intercropping+Si. Thus, by using intercropping with peanut and Si application, the plant growth, yield and quality of sugarcane and soil nutrient could be improved.

Sole cropping systems are depleting the soil resources with simultaneous decrease in productivity of field crops, especially cereals. In this scenario, intercropping cereals and legumes might be a pragmatic option to improve the system productivity and profitability. This two-year field study was conducted to test the productivity of barley-lentil intercropping system with different planting techniques. The experiment consisted of ten different treatments, i.e., i) lentil alone sown in 30 cm spaced single rows, ii) 3-rows of lentil on beds with 45 cm irrigation furrows, iii) 4-rows of lentil on beds with 60 cm irrigation furrows, iv) 6-rows of lentil on beds with 90 cm irrigation furrows, v) 8-rows of lentil on beds with 120 cm irrigation furrows, vi) 3-rows of lentil on beds with barley in 45 cm irrigation furrows, vii) 4-rows of lentil on beds with barley in 60 cm irrigation furrows, viii) 6-rows of lentil on beds with barley in 90 cm irrigation furrows, ix) 8-rows of lentil on beds with barley in 120 cm irrigation furrows and x) barley alone. The results indicated that all intercropping systems reduced the barley and lentil yield to a significant extent compared with monoculture of both crops. However, in barley production, the extra harvest obtained from lentil intercropping resulted in higher productivity than barley monoculture. Barley-lentil intercropping had 69-86% yield advantage on mono-cropped barley with the highest income of US$ 1432.24 ha(-1). In terms of aggressivity, relative crowding coefficient and competitive ratio, barley was dominant crop in all treatments. There was a progressive decrease in the amount of water used with increase in the size of strip from 3 to 8 rows with 45 to 120 cm irrigation furrows. The maximum water use efficiency (3.55-4.84 kg/cf(3)) was recorded for 8-row strip system with 120 cm irrigation furrows as compared to all other planting geometries. In crux, 8-rows of lentil on beds with barley in 120 cm irrigation furrows proved the best intercropping system which provided the highest net income and benefit cost ratio, which could be used to maximize the productivity of barley-lentil intercropping system.

Berseem clover (BC) cv. Derya and triticale (T) cv. Tacettinbey were used as plant materials. The seed mixture ratios were sole crops BC and T, BC (80%) + T (20%), BC (60%) + T (% 40), BC (40%) + T (%60) and BC (20%) + T (80%). Forage harvest stages were beginning of flowering (HI), 50% flowering (H2) and full flowering (H3) stages of berseem clover. The experiment was established in a split plot design with four replications under lowland conditions. The mixture-ratios and harvest-stages were allocated as main plots and sub-plots, respectively. In addition to dry matter yield (DMY) and botanical composition, silage samples were evaluated for crude protein (CP), pH, acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) concentrations and digestible dry matter (DDM), relative feed value (RFV) and dry matter intake (DMI). The results of the study showed that the seed mixture of 60 % berseem clover + 40 % triticale and harvest at the 100% flowering stage of berseem clover were superior in terms of yield and selected quality parameters.

The results showed that the taproot length, number of first order.lateral roots, root volume, root-nodule fresh weight, number of root-nodules and root dry weight were increased by Mo treated after blooming. Moreover, 2.0 g/kg Mo treatment increased root growth morphological characteristics (except the taproot length) most strikingly in net cropping system, while 1.0 g/kg Mo treatment increased root growth morphological characteristics most significantly in relay strip intercropping system. It could be found that the taproot length in relay strip intercropping system was the most strikingly higher than that in net cropping system, while the first order lateral root number, root volume, root-nodules fresh weight and the number of root-nodule of net cropping soybean were most markedly higher than those of relay strip intercropping soybean at R-2 stage. The results also showed that seed treatment with Mo at a suitable concentration could delay root senescence, and it was more sensitive to Mo treatment of relay strip intercropping soybean, lower concentration could achieve the effect of delaying root senescence.

Two levels of weed control and weed interference in row replacement series system in the form of factorial was designed with Randomized Complete Blocked Design (RCBD) in 3 replications in the College of Agriculture, Lorestan University, from 2006 - 2007. Results showed that the interaction of weed and the contribution of complementary components of intercropping has significant effect on crude protein (CP) and neutral detergent fibers (NDF) content in barley. Maximum CP and NDF were related to sole cropping of barley (infected by weeds), and maximum CP with minimum NDF were related to (narbon vetch: barley) 75:25 treatment, so that 31% of CP decreased in sole cropping of barley (infected by weeds) when compared with 75:25 combination. NDF percentage in sole cropping increased to 16.6%, therefore 25:75 (narbon vetch: barley) combination was better than the others. So, in order to get proper percentage of protein and digestibility of forage for livestock, 75:25 (infected by weeds) combination is better, especially the combination of 25:75 (infected by weeds), due to its high protein content. The highest and lowest dry forage production of barley were related to its sole cropping (a control which is equal to 3.75 t/ha) and 75:25 barley (infected by weeds that are equal to 1.59 t/ha), respectively.

Does intercropping winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) with red fescue (Festuca rubra) as a cover crop improve agronomic and environmental performance?

We studied the impact of various approaches to manage a red fescue cover crop in a winter wheat crop in terms of light, water and nitrogen competition, using the STICS crop model adapted for intercropping. The STICS model for wheat/fescue intercropping was first evaluated on two years of experimental data obtained in the field. It gave satisfactory statistical results for the prediction of dry matter, leaf area index (LAI) and nitrogen accumulation in the two species, and for nitrogen and water dynamics in the soil. By simulating unmeasured variables, such as transpiration, the model improves our understanding of the performance of the intercrop in the field. For example, we showed that the intercropping system was more efficient that wheat grown as a sole crop, in terms of nitrogen accumulation and decreasing soil nitrogen levels before the leaching period. However, it also resulted in lower wheat yields. We then used the STICS model to compare four intercropping management scenarios differing in terms of the date of red fescue emergence, over 35 climatic years. We found that, in most climatic scenarios, the emergence of the fescue crop during the late tillering phase of the wheat crop gave the best compromise between wheat yield overall nitrogen accumulation and radiation interception.

Three levels (0, 45 and 90 Kg N ha(-1)) of nitrogen fertilizer and three cropping systems (sole barley, sole vetch and barley-vetch intercropping) were allocated to the main and sub plots, respectively. The barley-vetch intercropping treatment had a replacement arrangement (50: 50) with single alternate rows. Land equivalent ratio (LER), was used to compare sole cropping with intercropping systems. Results showed the supremacy of intercropping of barley and vetch over single crops. Generally, increasing nitrogen fertilizer caused a decreasing trend in the biological efficiency of intercropping. The highest LER for grain was obtained in control (N fertilizer free) plots (LER=1.145). Nitrogen fertilizer increased the forage yield, grain yield, crude protein content, and crude protein yield of barley and vetch in sole and intercrops. Nitrogen application increased water use efficiency. In this study, barley was the dominant crop. The intercropping vetch and barley had the highest productivity and crude protein yield.

Messire/conventional leafed, cv, Profi/semileafless) and oats (Avena sativa; cv. Alf) were grown as sole crops and in substitutive mixtures. The sole crops were established at 80 pea seeds m(-2) and 300 oat seeds m(-2). The mixtures consisted of 67% (pea) and 33% (oats) of the monoculture densities, respectively. Interactions of cv. Messire or cv. Profi and oats were similar in 1995 and 1996. The mixtures outyielded the monocultures with respect to total above ground dry matter (RYT = 1.15) and grain yield (RYT = 1.09). Grain yield of pea and oats averaged 4.9 t ha(-1) in monocultures and 5.5 t ha(-1) in mixtures. Oats was relatively the stronger of the two competitors. Decreasing number of pods per plant could be highlighted as the factor for a lower pea seed frequency in the yield of the mixtures. For oats the number of panicles per plant and kernels per panicle were higher in the mixtures compared with the oat monocultures. The average amount of the harvest index (HI) was 0.52 for pea and 0.46 for oats. Favourable growth conditions increased HI values however, prolific vegetative growth in the mixtures resulted in lower HI values. The predicted RYT-values estimate the maximum combined grain yield of 6.3 t ha(-1) in the mixture of 87% pea (70 seeds m(-2)) and 13% oats (39 kernels m(-2))."

Two different pathotype combinations were tested, with different host components. Each combination included a complex (able to infect two host components) and two simple pathotypes. For one of the combinations, induced resistance was tested in a separate experiment as a possible interaction among pathotypes. Disease severity and pathotype frequencies were measured three times during the epidemic, on each host component grown in pure stands and in mixtures. In one of the experiments, pathotype frequencies were also measured within secondary foci. One of the complex pathotypes appeared to have a low fitness on one of the host components and did not significantly increase in frequency in host mixtures relative to pure stands. The average frequency of the other complex pathotype increased during the first epidemic cycles, but remained stable afterwards, below expected values. The results suggest that the development of complex pathotypes in host mixtures may be influenced by differential aggressiveness on the host components, by induced resistance and by random effects resulting from the formation of disease foci, and depends on pathogen autoinfection rate and dispersal mechanisms.

Three treatments were established: 1. Maguey in monoculture; 2. Maguey intercropped with corn; and 3. Maguey intercropped with bean. Every treatment was replicated six times. An experimental design of randomized complete blocks was used. One agave plant was one experimental unit. Monthly, from August 2011 to July 2012, number of new unfolded leaves and leaf area were recorded. These variables by month and accumulated month to month were analyzed. To the end of the study, increments in diameter, chlorophyll content in leaves and moisture in soil were evaluated. Data were submitted to analysis of variance and mean comparisons by Tukey's test with P = 0.05. Monthly evaluation showed than in August 2011 the agaves intercropped with bean unfolded 42 and 12 % more leaves than agaves in monoculture and those intercropped with corn, respectively; in February 2102, agave plants unfolded 100 and 54 % more leaves than agaves intercropped with corn or under monoculture, respectively. Month to month accumulation showed that from October 2011 to July 2012, agaves intercropped with bean formed more leaves than agaves intercropped with corn, with a maximum difference of 28 % in May; from January to June 2012, it showed more leaf area, with a maximum difference of 49 % in May. Annual evaluation showed that agaves plants intercropped with bean unfolded 36 % more leaves than those in monoculture. Moisture of soil did not change significantly between treatments. It was concluded that agave mezcalero can grow more when intercropped with bean, and it grows less when intercropped with corn."

Banana leaf pruning to facilitate annual legume intercropping as an intensification strategy in the East African highlands	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"Banana; Intercrop; Leaf pruning; Legume; LER; Revenue"	"YIELD; NITROGEN; BIOMASS; REMOVAL; ROBUSTA; CASSAVA; MAIZE"	Banana leaf pruning is a common practice to facilitate intercropping with legumes on farmers' fields. It is however not clear if this practice improves farmers land-use and economic efficiency, especially after full canopy formation. To analyze pruning effects, three legumes viz. bush bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L), climbing bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L) and soybean (Glycine max), were planted under three banana leaf pruning levels in which four, seven and all fully grown leaves were retained. Sole banana or legume plots served as controls. Each treatment combination was replicated three times. Banana growth and yield attributes were measured for the plant and first ratoon crops while legume biomass and yields determined over five consecutive cropping seasons. Significant (P < 0.001) reductions in banana growth and yield were associated with leaf pruning. Banana yield reductions of 31% and 10% for the four- and seven-leaf retention treatments, respectively occurred. The vigorous intercrops (climbing beans and soybeans) more often depressed the growth and yield of banana. Legume grain and biomass yields increased with leaf pruning levels. Weed biomass and associated management costs increased with decline in shade intensity. The land-use efficiency measured using the land equivalence ratio (LER) was far lower in the treatment with four-leaves (1.10) compared to when all leaves were retained (1.4) but higher (1.54) for the seven-leaf treatment. Severe banana leaf pruning could thus be detrimental to banana performance and inefficient. Moderate banana leaf pruning could however be promoted were land is limiting and farmers want to maximize diversity/nutrition. However, the highest values for gross revenue and benefit-cost ratio were realized for sole banana-all-leaf retention treatment due to a higher labor productivity and lower input costs attributed to the perennial nature of banana. The higher economic efficiency in sole banana plots suggests that reliance on LER only may be insufficient for guiding intercropping decisions.	"[Ocimati, W.; Groot, J. C.

Senegalese millet fields are infested with Helicotylenchus. The native evergreen woody shrub Pihostigma retic ulatumi s widely distributed in sub-Saharan Africa. Its coppiced residues are used by small farmers as mulch in crop fields. The shrub's nematicidal effect on the spiral nematode Hehmohdenchus dihystera was evaluated in a pearl millet pot experiment. The abundance of nematodes decreased by 64% after application of either leaf powder or a pulverized mixing of leaves and stems, suggesting the use of aboveground materials of P reficulatum as a potential nematicide. The results show promise for use of a local resotu're. by subsistence farmers in the Sahel. Further research is needed on application to fully develop this approach as a biopesticide.

A split plot design with three replicates was used. The results could be summarized as follows:- Intercropping pattern of 2:2 recorded the highest values for total fresh and dry forage yields whereas cowpea intercropped on the other side gave the lowest values in both seasons. Seeding rate of 75%+50% teosinte/cowpea recorded the highest values for total fresh and dry forage yields in both seasons. Intercropping pattern 2:2 with 75% teosinte+50% cowpea gave the highest value of totally fresh and dry yields. Whereas, planting cowpea on the other side with 50% seeding rates of both crops, gave the lowest values in both seasons. Crude protein and digestible protein percentages, crude protein and digestible protein yields fed(-1) were increased by different intercropping patterns. Seeding rates and the interaction between them compared with teosinte pure stand in both seasons, whereas fiber percentage behaved opposite trend in both season. Land equivalent ratio (LER) and relative crowding coefficient recorded the highest values by the interaction between 2:2 ridges and 75% teosinte+50% cowpea seeding rates of its pure stands in both seasons.

Relinking croplands and livestock to promote wastes and by-products exchange has been suggested to provide opportunities for sustainable intensification of agriculture systems. However, the environmental and economic performances of such crop-livestock systems remain highly context specific and unclear. This study proposed an emergy-LCA-based framework to study the GHG mitigation and ecological and economic benefits of the integrated crop planting and livestock feeding systems, by taking wheat maize rotation-swine systems (WMRS), tea-swine systems (TS) and citrus alfalfa intercropping-swine systems (CAIS) as the empirical cases. The results showed the three case modes can generally promote GHG mitigation and ecological and economic benefits. CAIS had the lowest carbon footprint per kcal product (0.12 g CO2-eq kcal(-1)), followed by TS (0.61 g CO2-eq kcal(-1)) and MWRS (0.66 g CO2-eq kcal(-1)). The significant difference in this indicator can be attributed to their different upstream input and manure management. Due to the lower dependence on purchased resources, CAIS also had the best performance on emergy-based sustainability and economic benefits. Based on our results, the policy implications, including promoting wastes and by-products exchange, choosing reasonable manure treatment mode and conducting systematic planning have been suggested to provide opportunities for GHG mitigation and sustainable intensification of agro-systems.

The objective of this study is to evaluate long-term NT systems with different histories, management and different quantity and quality of plant residues on chemical and microbiological soil properties. The NT systems are located in three experimental fields of Embrapa Cerrados, in the Cerrado region, with 26, 21 and 12 years of establishment. The NT systems were characterized for soil chemical and microbiological properties and for quantity and quality of crop residues. Soil properties studied were basal respiration (BR), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and microbial quotient (qMIC) in three depths from 0-30 cm layer. The systems with annual succession of soybean with maize intercropped with U. brizantha grazed or not in the off-season increased the quantity of crop residues (around 10.70 ton ha(-1)) and contributed more to the quality of the vegetal residues, in addition to increasing MBC (up to 716 mg kg(-1) soil), TN (between 4 and 5 g kg(-1) soil), TOC (35 to 40 g kg(-1) soil) and qMIC (up to 1.83%), which indicates that this system promoted improvement in the quality of chemical and biological soil properties and contributed to carbon accumulation in the soil over a period of 26 years.

Effect of proportion of component species on the productivity of Solanum aethiopicum and Amaranthus lividus under intercropping	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						"Garden egg (Solanum aethiopicum); spleen amaranth (Amaranthus lividus); proportion of component species; plant population; intercropping; yield advantage"	"MAIZE; SYSTEMS; WHEAT"	In central Uganda, 'garden egg' ( Solanum aethiopicum) is commonly intercropped with 'spleen amaranth' ( Amaranthus lividus) but the productivity of this mixture is unknown. The objective of the experiment was to determine the yield advantage from this mixture. Treatments tested included pure stands of Solanum aethiopicum and Amaranthus lividus, locally called nakati and ebugga, respectively, 'additive mixtures', and several 'replacement series' mixtures. Generally, pure stands gave the highest total and edible DM yields. For each species, DM yield in mixtures was significantly higher ( P<0.05) in mixtures in which it constituted the highest proportion, that is 75:25% Solanumi:Amaranthus replacement series mixture in the case of S. aethiopicum, and 25:75% mixture in the case of A. lividus. Intercropping reduced total S. aethiopicum DM yield by 72% in the 25: 75% Solanum: Amaranthus mixture, while A. lividus yield was reduced by 68% in the 75: 25% mixture. There was high correlation between S. aethiopicum and A. lividus plant population and edible DM yield ( r = 0.71 and 0.98, respectively). The difference in yield between pure stand S. aethiopicum and the 75: 25% Solanum: Amaranthus mixture was not significant yet it was associated with 93 kg ha(-1) of edible DM yield of A. lividus as a 'bonus' yield, equivalent to 27% of the edible DM yield of pure stand A. lividus. Generally, the additive mixtures gave higher S. aethiopicum DM yield than the replacement series mixtures with less than 50% S. aethiopicum. The 37% lower edible DM yield of S. aethiopicum in the double compared to the single additive mixture was attributed to greater competition against S. aethiopicum by the double Amaranthus rows compared to the single Amaranthus rows but the double additive mixture had about 55% more edible Amaranthus DM yield than the single additive. Most mixtures gave yield advantages, with the double (47%) and single (39%) additive mixtures giving higher yield advantages than the replacement series mixtures. On the basis of gross returns, most mixtures were more profitable than the pure stands.

E. Thailand and S. Sumatra	NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						"economics; income; labour; cropping systems; hedgerow intercropping; leguminous crops; cover crops; soil fertility; South East Asia"		The use of food-crop intercropping, hedgerow intercropping and secondary or cover cropping to increase incomes of resource-poor farmers in South East Asia was investigated. Since all systems improve conservation of nutrients and most give extra marketable produce, they were expected to increase farm profitability. On upland farms in Lampung, South Sumatra, both inter- and secondary crops were found to improve yields compared with cassava monocropping and thus the income derived from growing cassava or rice with maize. These increases were equivalent to between 70 and 440 US dollars per hectare. An economic analysis of the lowland rice-producing systems in North East Thailand suggested that with the exception of growing cowpea, the use of pre-rice cover crops was not profitable despite a substantial increase in rice yield, because the additional labour cost more than the additional income was worth. A benefit of leguminous crops, however, can be the extra marketable product. Groundnut in Indonesia and cowpea in Thailand gave an attractive extra US$ 400-1150 total income increase per hectare per year (i.e. extra yield of the main food crop plus extra marketable produce from the secondary crop) even after the additional costs were deducted. Hedgerow intercropping gave smaller profit margins of about US$ 90. Although both hedgerow intercropping and secondary cropping represent a considerable investment of labour by farmers, this investment may be more feasible than paying for fertilizer on credit. On balance the most attractive option tested was the use of a leguminous secondary crop, e.g. groundnut or multipurpose cowpea, within the food crop cycle.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of lupin/wheat intercropping on soil properties, grain yield and nutrient uptake at different plant densities. Lupin and wheat were grown under field conditions as monocrops and intercrops. Soil nutrient availability and relative abundance of functional genes (acdS,phoD,phoC and nifH) were evaluated. The results obtained indicate that the cropping system had a significant effect (p < 0.001) on N and P availability. Lupin monocrop led to significantly higher N availability compared to intercrop. Intercropping resulted in significantly lower Olsen-P and K in soil concentrations compared to monocropping. No significant differences were observed in enzyme activity, except for phosphatase, which was 152% greater in the treatments at high plant density. Foliar nutrients were significantly higher in intercropping compared to monocropping. Acid phosphatase gene phoC was more abundant than the alkaline phosphatase gene phoD, which plays a more relevant role in acidic Andisols. The results confirm that N and P mobilization can improve nutrient absorption on wheat. When intercropped, lupin had positive effects on wheat due to its P mobilization capacity, while no effects were observed on lupin.

Shade conditions are characterized by changes in light density and quality. These changes, which are represented by the red to far-red (R/Fr) ratio of light, directly affect the photosynthetic capacity of soybean in close-planting and intercropping systems. We postulated that high far-red light under shade conditions would improve crop photosynthesis. Herein, we conducted a quantitative proteomic analysis through the isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantification approach to investigate the response of photosynthetic proteins to the interaction between light intensity and quality. We, identified 7834 proteins (P value < 0.05, FC > 1.3) from soybean leaves. Among these proteins, 98 are associated with differential chloroplast accumulation under shade (S, low light intensity and low R/Fr ratio) and normal light (N, normal light intensity and normal R/Fr ratio) conditions. Additionally, 134 are associated with differential chloroplast accumulation under low light (L, low light intensity and normal R/Fr ratio) and N conditions. Eight representative proteins that are involved in photosynthesis were differentially regulated under L and S treatments. These proteins included one protein involved in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, three proteins involved in light-harvesting chlorophyll protein complex, and four proteins involved in photosynthesis. Among the eight differentially regulated proteins under L and S treatments, five up-regulated proteins (protochlorophyllide reductase; light-harvesting complex II chlorophyll a/b binding protein [Lhcb1]; Lhcb2; photosystem I subunit II; and plastocyanin [PetE]) and three down-regulated proteins (Lhcb4; Ferredoxin-1; and NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase [NQO]) were validated through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot methods L and S treatments decreased net photosynthesis rate (PO but increased chlorophyll content; thylakoid stacking; and photosystem II (PSII), PSI, and electron transport associated protein levels. Likewise, N and S treatments decreased PetE and NQO protein expression levels. This effect, in turn, decreased P700 oxidation. In addition, the higher far-red light of the S treatment than that of the L treatment increased P-n by up-regulating the gene expressions of differential proteins. We conclude that light intensity directly affects photosynthesis by regulating the expression of photosynthetic proteins. High far-red light, however, can improve the photosynthetic capacity of plants under shade conditions."

Field experiments were carried out to study the effect of intercropping a normal-leafed (cv. E.F.B. 33) or a semi-leafless, early-flowering winter pea (cv. James) and triticale on the infestation with annual weeds, pea aphids and moths in comparison to the respective sole crops. Also, shallow ploughing (10 to 12 cm) vs. deep ploughing (25 to 27 cm) was investigated with regard to an infestation with annual weeds. The higher weed suppressive ability of normal-leafed winter pea cv. E.F.B. 33 compared with semi-leafless cv. James was due to a lower light transmission to the weed canopy level. In contrast to E.F.B. 33, intercropping James significantly reduced the weed infestation compared to the respective sole crop. The ploughing system had no significant effect on the weed infestation in crops differing in their ability to suppress annual weeds. Sole crops were found to have higher pea aphid density, incidence and cumulative aphid-days than the corresponding intercrops. Intercropping winter peas and triticale, however, was not beneficial in reducing an infestation with pea moths.

This study investigates Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)-attenuated total reflexion (ATR) spectroscopy followed by cluster analysis for the discrimination of pea and oat roots. Pea and oat plants were grown under various conditions - in moist paper, soil-compost mixture, soil, in the greenhouse and field - to enhance the intra-species variability of their chemical composition. FTIR-ATR spectra of young-to-old roots from four independent experiments were recorded and represent, like a fingerprint, the chemical sample composition such as lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, etc. To group the spectra according to their spectral similarity in a dendrogram, cluster analysis was performed. The experimental approach discriminated pea and oat roots 100% successfully. The perfect discrimination of pea and oat roots, even from intercropped plants, strikingly demonstrates the potential of the method. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Disease pressure was variable in the experiments. Intercropping had almost no effect on disease development on stipules regardless of disease pressure. In contrast, disease severity on pods and stems was substantially reduced in the pea-cereal intercrop compared to the pea monocrop when the epidemic was moderate to severe. Therefore, a pea-cereal intercrop could potentially limit direct yield loss and reduce the quantity of primary inoculum available for subsequent pea crops. Disease reduction was partially explained by a modification of the microclimate within the intercrop canopy, in particular, a reduction in leaf wetness duration during and after flowering. The effect of intercropping on splash dispersal of conidia was investigated under controlled conditions using a rainfall simulator. Total dispersal was reduced by 39 to 78% in pea-wheat canopies compared to pea canopies. These reductions were explained by a reduction in host plant density and a barrier or relay effect of the non-host plants.
