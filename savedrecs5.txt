This study evaluated the economic returns under legume intercropping systems using value/cost ratio (VCR) and benefit/cost ratio (BCR) under treatments comprising of potato intercropped with dolichos (Lablab purpureus L.) (P-D), climbing bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) (P-B) and garden pea (Pisum sativum L.) (P-G), and a potato pure stand control (P-S). Across the seasons, tuber yield was not significantly (p < 0.05) affected by intercropping with P-D, whereas under P-B and P-G, it decreased by 19% and 16%, respectively compared to P-S. P-G, P-B and P-D recorded 6, 7 and 12% higher potato equivalent yield (PEY) relative to P-S. P-D was the most profitable intercropping system with VCR of 35 and BCR of 5.1 as compared to values recorded in P-S of 31 and 5, respectively. Regression of VCR against PEY resulted in a stronger coefficient (0.98) compared to that of BCR against PEY (0.82) implying that VCR is a simple tool that could be adopted for economic returns to investment studies such as potato-legume intercropping systems.

Synergism and antagonisms between nutrients induced by copper toxicity in grapevine rootstocks: Monocropping vs. intercropping	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						"Grapevine; Copper; lntercropping; Monocropping; Root exudates"	"NATURAL FE COMPLEXES; APOPLASMIC IRON; VINEYARD SOILS; ACCUMULATION; TRANSPORTER; PROTEINS; PLANTS; CU; L.; PHYTOTOXICITY"	The long-term use of Cu-containing fungicides contaminates vineyards soils, which can induce Cu toxicity and nutrient imbalances in several plant species. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of Cu toxicity on two grapevine rootstocks, Fercal and 196.17, and to elucidate if intercropping with oat can alleviate grapevine Cu toxicity. Plants were hydroponically-cultivated and treated with different Cu concentrations. At harvest the biomass accumulation, the SPAD index and the symplastic and apoplastic root and leaves ionome were measured to evaluate possible synergistic and/or antagonistic effects on other micro- and macronutrients. The root exudation analysis was correlated with genes expression (VvPEZ-like), whereas PCA analysis performed on the grapevine and oat ionome revealed that both mono- and intercropped 196.17 rootstock display a positive effect on Zn and Mn in the root tissues at high Cu concentrations. An increase of Zn and Mn in roots was also reported for the intercropped Fercal rootstock at high Cu concentrations while an antagonistic relation was reported for root Zn concentration in the monocropped Fercal rootstock. Our results showed that grapevine and oat compete for nutrient uptake and that this phenomenon can possibly alleviate grapevine Cu toxicity. However, Fercal rootstock is able to take advantage from oat, while 196.17 is disadvantaged by the intercropping system. Even though intercropping system seems to be a valuable tool to counteract grapevine Cu toxicity, the application of this agricultural practice has shown to be species dependent and should be evaluated for each rootstock.

J	"Mousa, KM; Ueno, T"				"Mousa, Kareem M.; Ueno, Takatoshi"			Intercropping Potato with Citrus Trees as Ecologically-Based Insect Pest Management	JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE KYUSHU UNIVERSITY			English	Article						"IPM; ground cover plants; piercing-sucking insect pests; Orius insidiosus; horticulture trees; Macrolophus caliginous; Scymnus interruptus"	"POPULATION-DYNAMICS; MIGRATION; PLANT; APHID; LEPIDOPTERA; AGROMYZIDAE; HOMOPTERA; ABUNDANCE; TILLAGE; DIPTERA"	Potato can be cultivated on various environments in different seasons, which makes it vulnerable to numerous insect pests. The presence of various types of insect pests may hinder the pest management with pesticides. Intercropping system provides an alternative nonchemical option for controlling insect pests. This study was carried out to evaluate the usefulness of intercropping potato under sweet orange Citrus sinensis trees. For this purpose, densities of four main sap-sucking insect pests and their natural enemy predators were examined in two cultivation seasons. The results indicated that the intercropping system could be a useful technique for using space under citrus trees. The intercropping system significantly reduced the infestation of whitefly Bemicia tabaci though the density of green peach aphid Myzus persicae rather increased. Planting systems also had a significant but minor impact on potato leafhopper Empoasca fabae and green sink bug Nezara viridula. Beside, the pest occurrence differed markedly between summer and winter potato fields. Natural enemies such as ladybeetle Coccinella undecimpunctata densities were greater on intercropping than mono-cropping potato in both winter and summer seasons but Orius insidiosus was rather fewer in intercropping systems. Our study suggests that the intercropping system is useful in pest management of potato.

Effect of crop rotation and crop sequences for the management of soybean nematodes in sandy soil	NEMATROPICA			Portuguese	Article						"crop systems; cover cropping; population density; Zea mays"	HOST STATUS	The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of summer crops rotation with soybean, corn and crotalaria species and succession with Urochloa ruzizisiensis and Pennisetum glaucum (ADR 300) as cover species on the population of three nematode species of importance for the soybean crop in sandy soils (Pratylenchus brachyurus, Meloidogyne javanica and Heterodera glycines). The experiment was established in naturally infested soil in a randomized complete block design with four replications, in a 5 X 2 factorial scheme (summer crops and intercropping management). The population density of the nematodes in the soil and roots during the harvest and off-season, as well as the dry mass of the cover crops and yield in the subsequent soybean were evaluated. The low population density of nematodes observed in plots cultivated with crotalaria allowed better development of autumn/winter crops (Ruzizigrass and millet). Rotation with Crotalaria spectabilis, C. ochroleuca and C. breviflora resulted in a reduction in the population density of the nematodes in relation to soybean monoculture and rotation with corn. As a positive response, the yield of the subsequent soybean in the plots that received crotalaria were two to three times higher than in those that received the soybean.	"[Silva, R. A.; Nunes, N.

Determining in-field dispersal of the redbanded stink bug (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) in soybean fields using a protein based mark-capture method	CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						"Piezodorus guildinii; protein marking; Mark-capture; Dispersal"	"NEZARA-VIRIDULA HEMIPTERA; MONITORING RANDOM-WALKS; INTERCROP MOVEMENT; INSECT PREDATORS; HETEROPTERA-PENTATOMIDAE; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; MULTISCALE APPROACH; SPECIES COMPOSITION; SEASONAL ABUNDANCE; PATTERN-FORMATION"	A study was designed to determine the dispersal of redbanded stink bug, Piezodorus guildinii (Westwood), adult and nymph in soybean fields using protein marking via a mark-captured method. Insects were marked by spraying the soybean field with 10% chicken egg white solution. Following marker application, insects were collected from the field. Marker on the insect body was detected using chicken egg albumin specific indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to assess dispersal of P. guildinii. The protein marking was found to be a viable option for marking P. guildinii that provided direct proof of insect movement. With this marking technique, we were able to detect 50% or more protein marked insects for 3 days after field marking, however marker was detected in 50% or more soybean leaf sample only for 2 days after field marking. Marking efficiency drastically reduced after 4-5 days of marker application in the soybean field. Thus, the method, though useable, has limitations. Mean dispersed distance of P. guildinii was up to 137.0 +/- 21.5 m along soybean rows and 15.3 +/- 1.2 m across rows. Mean nymphal dispersal (4th and 5th instars) was documented up to 122.0 +/- 7.0 m along and 11.7 +/- 1.7 m across soybean rows.

A field trial was conducted for four consecutive seasons between 2014 short rains and 2016 long rains to assess the effect of incorporating legumes as intercrops into potato cropping systems on N and P uptake and uptake efficiency by the potato crop and nutrient use efficiency. The treatments included potato intercropped with either dolichos (Lablab purpureus L.) (PD), garden pea (Pisum sativum L.) (PG) or climbing bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) (PB), and a pure stand of potato (PS). Intercropping potato with beans and peas significantly reduced its N uptake by 22 and 27% relative to PS, but the N uptake was not affected under PD. Phosphorous uptake was 2, 8 and 11 kg P ha(-1) lower in PD, PB and PG, respectively compared with PS. Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) was significantly higher in PD, PB and PG by 30, 19 and 9% compared with PS. Similarly, P use efficiency (PUE) was 6, 14 and 21% higher in PG, PB and PD, respectively than PS. The highest tuber yield recorded in PS (36 t ha(-1)) did not significantly differ from PD (34 t ha(-1)) whereas tuber yield was significantly lower in PB and PG as compared with PS. The study shows the great potential of dolichos as a promising intercrop that could be integrated into potato cropping systems without negatively affecting potato yield.

To ensure that the variations in the emissions with crop rotation are taken into account, the study covers a seven-year rotation cycle. The results suggest that the annual GWP of the whole farming system varies from 1816 to 2372 t CO(2)e over the rotation period, averaging 2118 t CO(2)e/yr or 2.65 t CO(2)e/ha. Dairy and beef cattle are the main contributors, causing 45% and 39% of GWP, respectively; this is mainly due to emissions of methane from enteric fermentation and nitrous oxide from manure. Crop cultivation adds a further 10% to the impact, while the contribution of sheep and pig husbandry is relatively small (6% and < 1%, respectively). Per kilogramme of meat, lamb and beef have the highest impact, estimated at 12-17.8 and 15.8-18.9 kg CO(2)e, respectively. By comparison, GWP from pig meat ranges from 5.6 to 8.5 kg CO(2)e/kg, largely caused by feed concentrate. The impact from milk production is estimated at 1.02-1.21 kg CO(2)e/l, mostly related to methane emissions from enteric fermentation. The GWP from wool ranges from 20.8-30.9 kg CO(2)e/kg. Among the crops, beans have the highest average impact (692 g CO(2)e/kg) and rye the lowest (157 g CO(2)e/kg). The hotspots for the crops are emissions of nitrous oxide from manure application to land and use of diesel in farm machinery. A sensitivity analysis shows that the assumptions for allocating N2O emissions over the rotation cycle have a significant effect on the results. Options for reducing GHG emissions include intercropping, optimisation of feed composition and anaerobic digestion of waste."

Rate of decline of Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici inoculum and decomposition of residues from wheat cultivars	AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						"Soil-borne disease; Cereal residues; Gaeumannomyces graminis; Take-all; Inoculum decline"	"TAKE-ALL; SOIL; TEMPERATURE; MANAGEMENT; PLACEMENT; ROOTS"	The rate of inoculum decline was determined for Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Ggt), a fungus causing take-all in cereals which survives saprophytically on crop debris during the intercrop period. Crop residues and Ggt inoculum in soil cores containing residues of six wheat cultivars from two fields were assessed in three experiments at intervals up to 7 months after harvest. At that time, for all cultivars, approximately three quarters of the original residue plant mass remained from crop residues where the stems were on the soil surface. The quantity of Ggt DNA per plant declined on average by 95% after 7 months, with most of the remaining inoculum residing in the stems and crown. Viable inoculum remaining in the plant residues was sufficient to infect newly planted wheat seedlings. It appears that after harvesting wheat exhibiting take-all, a period of more than 7 months is required to ensure inoculum in residues has declined sufficiently in soil to prevent reinfection of Ggt-susceptible cereal crops.

A possible improvement for this system is the insertion of the pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) to increase the protein rates of the pasture during the dry season. This work aimed to analyze the performance of off-season corn (Zea mays) productivity for silage integrated with signal grass (Urochloa ruziziensis) and different densities of pigeon pea. The experiment was carried out under a completely randomized design, with seven treatments and four repetitions each: corn + signal grass + five densities of pigeon pea (50 thousand, 100 thousand, 150 thousand, 200 thousand e 300 thousand plants per hectare), corn + signal grass and corn only. The highest productivity was on the treatment with 100 thousand plants of pigeon pea per hectare, although the fresh mass was not interfered with the presence of the pigeon pea, as observed for the corn and the signal grass. The corn - signal grass - pigeon pea intercropping is promising because it does not affect the main culture mass accumulation, when using up to 200 thousand plants of pigeon pea per hectare.

The experiment was carried out in the 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 crop seasons. Soybean was sown in the crop season and in the second crop, in a randomized complete block design, in nine production systems (treatments) consisting of annual crops (corn, sunflower, and cowpea) and cover crops (Pennisetum glaucum, Crotalaria breviflora, C. spectabilis, Urochloa ruziziensis, Cajanus cajan, Stylosanthes sp., and U. brizantha), which were grown in monocropping or intercropping systems, besides fallow as a control. Monocropped P. glaucum and U. ruziziensis showed a faster establishment and growth of plants, higher-total biomass and soil cover rate in the 2014 crop season. In 2015, corn intercropped with U. ruziziensis and C. spectabilis, and sunflower with U. ruziziensis stood out for total biomass production during flowering and after harvesting of corn and sunflower grains. Biomass composition in the systems showed greater proportions of stems than of leaves, and C. spectabilis stood out after senescence. Sown as a second crop, C. spectabilis promotes yield increase of soybean grown in succession in the no-tillage system.

The treatments consisted of lettuce cropping systems (monoculture and intercropping with green ear corn) and tillage systems [soil turned over without coverage; no-tillage with millet (Pennisetum americanum) mulch and live cover with forage peanut (Arachis pintoi)]. The plots were composed of individual beds with 1.2 m wide and 4.0 m length. Seeding of green ear corn was done in the center of the beds, with 0.5x1.6 m spacing, sown 10 days before transplanting the first lettuce crop. Two cycles of lettuce were grown and evaluated consecutively. Transplanting was done with 30x30 cm spacing, in a quincunx design. The green ear corn harvest was carried out at 80 days, and the lettuce harvest at 42 days, after transplantation in each cycle. The lettuce highest yield (285.4 g/plant) was obtained in monoculture planting system with millet mulch. The lettuce grown over live cover had the lowest yield (123.6 g/plant). The fresh ear corn yield (average of 346.4 g/plant) was not influenced by the intercropping and the soil cover."

During the rainy monsoon, soil erosion is prevalent, whereas a summer/autumn dry season induces drought stress. Crops respond differently to these stresses, and have different effects on soil water regime. This study used a combination of field observation and HYDRUS-2D modeling to assess the soil water dynamics and plant available water for peanut (Arachis hypogaea) and citrus (Citrus sinensis) at Sunjia Red Soil Critical Zone Observatory (CZO). Between April 1, 2012 and March 31, 2014, surface runoff and moisture content at 5, 20, 40, and 80 cm depths in the soil under both land uses were monitored at up, middle and foot slope positions along a hillslope. Results indicate that the citrus plot had higher soil water content at 5 cm depth during the dry season, and lower at 20, 40 and 80 cm depths throughout the year than the peanut plot. As expected, the soil water content was higher at foot slope, compared to up slope, and in deeper soil than near surface. We observed limited soil water availability to peanut during mid July to August, and to citrus from mid July to mid-November. Compared to the peanut plot, the citrus plot generally showed 12-28% greater evapotranspiration, 3-4 times less runoff, and 2-57% greater deep drainage. These differences were greater at the up slope position. Our data and HYDRUS-2D simulation suggest that the deep-rooted citrus reduced runoff during the rainy season by increasing macropore flow and canopy interception, and minimized the soil water stress during the dry season by utilizing water from deeper soil. Thus, we recommend trench planting of citrus along with peanut intercropping on hilly red soils as sustainable agricultural practices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Herbage intake, methane emissions and animal performance of steers grazing dwarf elephant grass v. dwarf elephant grass and peanut pastures	ANIMAL			English	Article						"Arachis pintoi; average daily gain; greenhouse gases; herbage intake; Pennisetum Purpureum"		Management strategies for increasing ruminant legume consumption and mitigating methane emissions from tropical livestock production systems require further study. The aim of this work was to evaluate the herbage intake, animal performance and enteric methane emissions of cattle grazing dwarf elephant grass (DEG) (Pennisetum purpureum cv. BRS Kurumi) alone or DEG with peanut (Arachis pintoi cv. Amarillo). The experimental treatments were the following: DEG pastures receiving nitrogen fertilization (150 kg N/ha as ammonium nitrate) and DEG intercropped with peanut plus an adjacent area of peanut that was accessible to grazing animals for 5 h/day (from 0700 to 1200 h). The animals grazing legume pastures showed greater average daily gain and herbage intake, and shorter morning and total grazing times. Daily methane emissions were greater from the animals grazing legume pastures, whereas methane emissions per unit of herbage intake did not differ between treatments. Allowing animals access to an exclusive area of legumes in a tropical grass-pasture-based system can improve animal performance without increasing methane production per kg of dry matter intake.

Soil microbial functional capacity and diversity in a millet-shrub intercropping system of semi-arid Senegal	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						"Sub-Saharan Africa; Piliostigma reticulatum; Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.; Soil enzyme activity; MicroResp (TM); 16S-and ITS-DGGE profiling"	"HYDRAULIC REDISTRIBUTION; RESIDUE DECOMPOSITION; CROP PRODUCTIVITY; NATIVE SHRUB; WEST-AFRICA; SAHEL; COMMUNITIES; AGROECOSYSTEMS; BIOMASS; CARBON"	A few species of shrubs grow with dryland row crops in farmers' fields throughout the Sahel and can significantly increase crop yield. The presence of shrub roots and litter inputs should have implications for soil nutrient pool sizes but there is limited information on the interactions of these shrubs with microbial communities involved in biogeochemical processes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the microbial composition and functional capacity of soil from the rooting zone of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) grown in the presence or absence of the shrub Piliostigma reticulatum in Senegal. Soil samples were collected from a long-term field study where millet was cultivated alone or intercropped with P. reticulatum with annual incorporation of coppiced shrub residues. Higher nutrient contents and distinct differences in microbial communities (DGGE profiles) were found between soils from beneath the canopy compared to soil outside the influence of shrubs. The catabolic response profile (MicroResp (TM)) showed that the soil microbial community at both shrub and non-shrub sampling locations, metabolized a wide range of substrates. Trehalose that can work as a signaling molecule was more rapidly degraded in the rooting zone of millet growing in the presence of P. reticulatum over millet alone. Urease, arylsulfatase and dehydrogenase activities in the millet root zone soil were higher when inter cropped with P. reticulatum which indicates enhanced potential of biogeochemical processes to proceed in the presence of this shrub. It is concluded that the native shrub P. reticulatum promotes a more diverse and active microbial community in the rooting zone of millet and further indicates greater potential to perform decomposition and mineralize nutrients.

The study was carried out in soil cultivated with cassava (C) intercropped with jack-beans (JB), millet (MI), and pigeon pea (PP), in comparison with the traditional system of cassava cultivation (TS) without cover species. Invertebrates of the epigeic fauna were collected using pitfall traps and those of the edaphic fauna were collected in soil monoliths. Among the epigeic invertebrates, the Collembola, Diptera, and Formicidae groups were dominant in all intercropping, accounting for over 80% of total relative frequency (RF), while in the soil fauna the Isoptera group was dominant in all intercropping, with the highest RF for the C+PP intercropping (90.2%), followed by C+JB (83.1%) and C+MI (65.6%), and the lowest RF occurred for TS (32%). The number of individuals of the epigeic fauna did not vary among the intercropping systems; however, the number of organism groups varied significantly. The C+MI intercropping showed the greatest richness of groups. The total density of organisms of the edaphic soil fauna varied among intercropping systems, and the highest density was observed in C+PP, in comparison to TS. The edaphic and epigeic fauna invertebrates respond to changes, favored by the intercropping green manure with cassava, by increasing group diversity."

The own-rooted 'Williams'- and 'Bosc's'-trees had many tree losses in the first year, they grew medium and started with fruiting later than the grafted trees. The trees on rootstock Quince Adams were growing very weakly in the high lime containing soil at the site, with the consequence of chlorosis, tree losses and small fruits, but also a higher brix-, vitamin C- and apple acid-content in the fruits. 'Bosc's' showed low yields on all rootstocks in the observing period. 'Williams' on Farold 69 and Seedling had good yield and fruit quality, while the weakly growing cultivar 'Uta' showed low tree losses and high yields on Seedling. Pyrodwarf had very few tree losses and was similar in growth and yield compared to Farold 69 and Seedling, however the fruits of 'Williams' and 'Bosc's' were smaller.

While corn and sorghum silages have lower crude protein (CP) contents than other crops, intercropping with legumes can increase CP content. Furthermore, one way to increase CP content is the addition of legumes to silage. Consequently, the research objective was to evaluate the fermentative and bromatological characteristics of corn (Zea mays) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) silages added with forage peanuts (Arachis pintoi). The experimental design was completely randomized with four replicates. The treatments consisted of corn silage, sorghum silage, forage peanut silage, corn silage with 30% forage peanut, and sorghum silage with 30% forage peanut. The results showed that the corn and sorghum added with peanut helped to improve the silage fermentative and bromatological characteristics, proving to be an efficient technique for silage quality. The forage peanut silage had lower fermentative characteristics than the corn and sorghum silages. However, the forage peanut silage had a greater CP content, which increased the protein contents of the corn and sorghum silages when intercropped with forage peanuts.

Inadequate weed control by herbicide use can select for resistant or tolerant biotypes, leading to a shift in the weed flora. An example is the increase of incidence of morning glory (Ipomoea spp.) in soybeans growing areas in South Brazil. The aim of this study was to determine the competitiveness of soybeans intercropped with I. triloba, I. indivisa and I. purpurea through a replacement experiments series. Greenhouse experiments were conducted in a completely randomized design with four replications. The first experiment was carried out aiming to get the plant population while total plant dry mass remained constant. Other experiments were done under replacement series experiments with soybeans and morning glory ratios of 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75 and 100:0 using the 250 plant m(-2) defined by the preliminary experiment. Leaf area, root and shoots dry mass were assessed. Diagrams along with index interpretation were used to performed a competitiveness analysis. Soybeans showed greater competitiveness as I. triloba, I. purpurea and I. indivisa species for the leaf area, root and shoots dry mass variables.

The knowledge of how root systems affect the growth of the individual species is useful for understanding the interactions in intercrops as well as for planning cover cropping strategies. The aim of this work was (i) to determine if different levels of N in the topsoil influence root depth (RD) and intensity of barley and vetch as sole crops or as an inter-cropped mixture and (ii) to test if the choice of a mixture or the N availability in the topsoil will influence the N uptake by deep roots. Methods In this study, we combined rhizotron studies with root extraction and species identification by microscopy with studies of growth, N uptake and 15N uptake from deeper soil layers, for studying the root interactions of root growth and N foraging for barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and vetch (Vicia sativa L.), frequently grown in mixtures as cover crops. N was added at 0 (N0), 50 (N1) and 150 (N2) kg N ha(-1). The roots discrimination relying on the anatomical and morphological differences observed between dicots and monocots proved to be a reliable method providing valuable data for the analysis. Important Findings The intercrop and the barley attained slightly higher root intensity (RI) and RD than the vetch, with values around 150 crosses m(-1) and 1.4 m, respectively, compared to 50 crosses m(-1) and 0.9 m for the vetch. At deep soil layers, intercropping showed slightly larger RI values compared to the sole-cropped barley. The barley and the intercropping had larger root length density (RLD) values (200-600 m m(-3)) than the vetch (25-130) at 0.8-1.2 m depth. The topsoil N supply did not show a clear effect on the RI, RD or RLD; however, increasing topsoil N favored the proliferation of vetch roots in the intercropping at deep soil layers, with the barley: vetch root ratio ranging from 25 at N0 to 5 at N2.

The study was conducted in winter season in 2010-2011 and in 2011-2012 at Ludhiana, India. Pendimethalin at 0.56 kg and 0.75 kg ha(-1) was applied immediately after sowing of gobhi sarson, raya, peas, garlic, and 2 days before transplanting of cabbage seedlings. Oxyfluorfen at 0.17 kg and 0.23 kg ha(-1) was applied immediately after sowing of peas and garlic and 2 days before transplanting of cabbage seedlings intercropped in autumn sugarcane. Representative samples of these vegetables were collected at 75, 90, 100, and 165 days after application of herbicides and analyzed by highperformance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) with diode array detector for residues. The residue level of pendimethalin and oxyfluorfen in mature vegetables was found to be below the limit of quantification which is 0.05 mg kg(-1) for both the herbicides. The soil samples were collected at 0, 7, 15, 30, 45, and 60 days after the application of their herbicides. The residues of herbicides in soil samples were found to be below the detectability limit of 0.05 mg kg(-1) after 60 days in case of pendimethalin and after 45 days in case of oxyfluorfen.

The intercrop period is opportune for reducing the severity of soilborne diseases. Objectives. The aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of a biofumigant amendment according to its location in the soil. Method. An experiment combining different locations of wheat take-all inoculum and of ground brown mustard amendment was conducted under semi-controlled conditions. Results. At the early plant development stage (GS22), an inoculum localized in superficial soil horizons caused more disease than a deeper inoculum. However, it was possible to reduce significantly the level of infection through the addition of a brown mustard amendment, particularly when located in the top soil. At a later plant development stage (GS32), the location of the inoculum had no further visible effect on the severity of root infections but wheat growth increased when ground mustard was incorporated at the surface layer of the soil or at the same level as the inoculum. Conclusions. These results suggest firstly, that ground mustard amendment can reduce necrosis caused by wheat take-all and can allow increased plant growth, and secondly, that the effect depends on the relative locations of the amendment and of the inoculum.

Habitat manipulation involved four major agricultural plants used as hosts by this herbivore to compose intercropping landscapes. Available biological parameters for D. speciosa on bean, soybean, potato and corn obtained under laboratory conditions were used to group the homogeneous landscapes, composed by each host plant, by a similarity measure of host suitability either for larval survival and development, and adult survival and fecundity. The results pointed corn as the most dissimilar culture. Therefore, intercropping corn with any other crop system tested could reduce insect spread through landscape. This was proved using a cellular automata model which simulate the physiological and behavioural traits of this insect, and also different spatial configurations of the intercropping. Spatio-temporal patterns obtained by simulations demonstrated that the availability of corn bordering the field edge, which are areas more likely to invasion, is key for insect population control.

Dual Cropping Winter Camelina with Soybean in the Northern Corn Belt	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							"RELAY INTERCROPPING SOYBEANS; PLANTING PATTERNS; SMALL GRAINS; WHEAT; YIELD; MANAGEMENT; FEEDSTOCK; DIESEL; ENERGY; FUEL"	Sustainably balancing biofuel crop production with food, feed, and fiber on agricultural lands will require developing new cropping strategies. Double- and/or relay-cropping winter camelina (Camelina sativa L.) with soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] may be a means to produce an energy and food crop on the same land in a single year. A study was conducted between 2009 and 2011 in west central Minnesota to evaluate yields, seed quality, economics, and within-field energy balance of winter camelinasoybean double-and relay-cropping systems compared with a conventional monocropped full-season soybean. Systems included methods to hasten camelina harvest (e. g., swathing and desiccating) to promote early soybean growth. Camelina seed yields were unaffected by cropping system and ranged from 1.1 to 1.3 Mg ha(-1). Relay-cropped soybean yields were greater than double-cropped soybean and were 58 to 83% of that for the monocropped control. Seed oil and protein content of double-and relay-cropped soybean were comparable to their monocropped counterpart and combined seed oil yield for the dual crop systems was as much as 50% greater. Net economic returns for the relay-crop treatments were competitive with that of the full-season soybean. Moreover, net energy of the relay-crop treatments was generally as high as the sole soybean crop, but energy efficiency (outputs/inputs) was less due to greater inputs. Results indicate that dual cropping of winter camelina with soybean is agronomically viable for the upper Midwest and might be an attractive system to growers seeking a cash cover crop.	"[Gesch, R.

This work aimed to evaluate the influence of different densities and sowing periods of Brachiaria brizantha BRS Piata on the yield of the cultivar M-8527 RR sown in intercropping. The experimental design was a randomized block in a (2 x 5) factorial arrangement with four replicates, including two sowing periods of B. brizantha (20 and 30 days after emergence of soybean seeds) and five sowing densities of Brachiaria (0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 kg ha(-1) seed). The following parameters were evaluated for soybean: plant height, shoot dry matter and grain yield. The variables evaluated were influenced by the densities and sowing periods of B. brizantha. Regardless of the sowing period of B. brizantha, all densities up to 3 kg ha-1 led to a reduction in soybean yield. However, yield was higher than 5 % only at the density of 12 kg ha(-1) sown at 30 DAE, as well as at 9 and 12 kg ha-1 sown at 20 DAE. The competitive effect of soybean, cultivar RR M-8527 was higher when B. brizantha cv. Piata was sown 30 days after crop emergence.	"[Saraiva, A. S.; Dornelas, B. F.; Silva, J. I. C.; Erasmo, E. A.

The experiment was conducted in an Oxisol in Cerrado conditions under no-tillage eight years ago. After the corn harvest intercropped with grass and cutting of forage homogenization were applied N rates (0, 50, 100 and 200 kg ha(-1) of N - urea source) in coverage. The plots consisted of Urochloa brizantha, Urochloa ruziziensis and Panicum maximum Tanzania and Mombaca sown at the time of corn sowing and subplots composed by accumulated amounts of nitrogen applied in forage plants prior to the soybean cultivation (0, 250, 500 and 1000 kg ha(-1) of N, after five cuts). The experimental design was a randomized block with four replications in a split plot. Soon after the last cut of the forage, proportionate amount of fresh mass of the species of each subplot was wrapped in nylon bags called Litter Bags, these being deposited in direct contact with the soil, to determine the time of decomposition of the dry mass during a period of 150 days. The nitrogen doses, as well as, the corn intercropped with forages (except with Mombaca) interfere similarly in the straw decomposition of forage and in the soybean yield in succession. All the consortiums of corn and nitrogen fertilization predecessors determined that, at 60 days after desiccation and cutting, still remained between 50 and 60% of the initial straw for no-tillage system.

During the last 10 years, a long-term comparison of ecological methods to reduce losses of nitrogen and phosphorus has been carried out with five treatments: perennial alfalfa soil mulching (G1), ryegrass and grain amaranth (soybean) rotation (G2), peanut rotation with wheat and intercropping with contour Toona sinensis hedgerows (G3), peanut rotation with wheat and intercropping with contour alfalfa hedgerows (G4) and a wheat-peanut rotation with conventional management practices (G5). Rainfall (P), runoff, rainfall intensities (I-10, I-20, I-30, I-60), sediment yield, and nitrogen and phosphorus losses from slope plots were analyzed for each rainfall event. The results showed that compared with wheat-peanut rotation and conventional management, perennial soil mulching, wheat-peanut rotation with alfalfa contour hedgerows and wheat-peanut rotation with toon contour hedgerows could effectively reduce runoff, sediment yield and losses of nitrogen and phosphorus from arable slope land. The reductions of sediment yield and losses of nitrogen and phosphorus increased with the increase of rainfall intensities and rainfall integrated indexes (PI10, PI20, PI30, PI60). In 9 years, average runoff was each reduced by 42%, 34% and 26% respectively, and sediment yields were each reduced by 87%, 86% and 84% respectively. In 8 years, average nitrogen loss was each reduced by 71%, 50% and 42% respectively; and phosphorus losses of those were each reduced by 84%, 68% and 64% respectively. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The following crops that were planted as second crop after soybeans were evaluated: (1) corn (Zea mays) planted at spacing of 90 cm between rows, intercropped with Brachiaria ruziziensis in the inter-rows; (2) sunflower (Helianthus annuus); (3) crambe (Crambe abyssinica); (4) radish (Raphanus sativus); (5) rapeseed (Brassica napus); and (6) winter fallow - no plantation after soybeans. Phytosociological characterization of weed species was carried out at the pre-planting of soybeans in the following cropping season. Estimations of relative abundance, relative frequence, relative dominance and Importance Value Index were made for each species present. Areas were also intra-characterized by the diversity coefficients of Simpson and modified Shannon-Weiner, and areas were compared using the Jaccard similarity coefficient for presence-only, by multivariate cluster analysis. In the short-term (a single cropping season), cultivation of winter crops do contribute for lower occurrence of weed species at the pre-planting of soybeans on the subsequent cropping season. The suppressive effects depend both on the species grown in the winter and in the amount of straw left on the soil by these winter crops.

Improving or maintain fertility at existing level is possible through the changes in the existing cropping pattern as the farmers of dry land do not have the tradition and capacity to use costly fertilizers. A set of experiments were conducted at New Developmental Farm, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Agricultural University Peshawar, Pakistan during 2008-2010 to evaluate the effect of preceding cropping pattern and nitrogen application effect on rainfed wheat. Wheat variety Pirsabak-2005 was sown in a randomized complete block design with split plot arrangement, having three replications. Wheat was planted after the previous cropping patterns i.e., millet, sorghum, sesame, mungbean, guar and groundnut as sole and each in combination with groundnut were repeated for two consecutive years (2008-2010). Cropping pattern was allotted to main plot and current application of three levels of nitrogen (0,45 and 90 kg ha(-1)) to subplots. The results showed that cropping pattern of legumes (sole) as preceding crops has retained more soil N as compared with non-legumes(sole) followed by the groundnut+ sesame. Planned mean comparison exhibited that plots sown with legumes crops (groundnut, mungbean and guar) produced higher grain yields of wheat crop. Higher response of wheat to N application by the preceding cropping pattern of groundnut + sesame, groundnut + mungbean or sesame (sole) was observed. Significant increase in the grain yield and yield component were observed with application of N. As both soil N reserve and grain yield increased by preceding legumes (sole) or groundnut+ sesame, growing of legumes (sole) or intercropping of legumes+ sesame than cereal (sole) as preceding crop is suggested. N application of 45 kg ha-1 to rainfed wheat having legume as preceding crop is recommended.

ROOTS	ACTA SCIENTIARUM POLONORUM-HORTORUM CULTUS			English	Article						"salsify; soil mulching; pre-winter and spring ploughing; ridges"	"TILLAGE; SOIL"	Due to frequent cultivation procedures and the chemicalization of crops the cultivated layer of soil is often subject to detrimental changes in its physical, chemical and biological characteristics. The aggregate structure of the soil disappears, the content of organic substance is lowered and the biological activity diminished. In order to reproduce the organic substance of the soil and improve its characteristics ploughed intercrops are introduced in the horticulture. The biomass of common vetch, tansy phacelia and oats were used for soil cultivation for the crop cultures of salsify. It was then confirmed, that independently from the intercrop plant used, the ploughed biomass had a significantly positive influence on the yield of salsify roots. The positive influence of the organic substance added to the soil on the percentage of marketable yield of roots and the total amount of crops were both confirmed. Among the investigated intercrops the common vetch had the most beneficial influence on the crops of salsify. The most beneficial method of cultivation of salsify crops proved to be its cultivation on ridged soil, which resulted in the largest crop yield and the largest percentage of marketable yield. The roots from this type of culture were also longer and had higher phosphorus content. Due to the beneficial influence on the root crops and its structure, the best time for ploughing of the biomass of the intercrops was the spring term.

The purpose of the present studies was to determine the effect of oats, common vetch and tansy phacelia as intercrop cover plants on the formation of microorganisms communities in the soil under the cultivation of root chicory and salsify. Before winter, cover plants formed an abundant green mass, which constituted the natural mulch on the surface of the land managed in two ways: 1) pre-winter ploughing, or 2) spring ploughing. The control was the conventional cultivation of these vegetables, i.e. without any cover plants. The microbiological analysis of the soil showed that regardless of the species of the studied vegetable, the total population of bacteria and the population of bacteria Bacillus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. were the highest when the soil was mulched with oats. A little fewer of those microorganisms occurred after using the mulch of common vetch or phacelia. On the other hand, the fewest bacteria were obtained as a result of the traditional cultivation of those vegetables. The total population of fungi in the soil mulched with oats was the lowest, whereas the most of fungi occurred in the control. The cultivation system, i.e. performing the spring or pre-winter ploughing, rather had no significant effect on the population of the studied microorganisms in the soil. Among the studied vegetables, the following were most frequently isolated: Alternaria alternata, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium oxysporum, Pythium irregulare, Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Gliocladium spp., Penicillium spp. and Trichoderma spp. Laboratory tests showed that both the cultivation of root chicory and salsify which included cover crops promoted the development of antagonistic bacteria (Bacillus spp. and Pseudomonas spp.) and fungi (Gliocladium spp., Penicillium spp. and Trichoderma spp.) better than the traditional cultivation of those vegetables.

In all, nine treatments, eight comprising integrated nutrient-use practices, chemical fertilizer (CF), farmyard manure (FYM), and green leaf manure (GLM) to supply nitrogen (N) at 45 kg N ha(-1) and one farmer's practice equivalent to 25 kg N ha(-1) (FYM 5 t ha(-1)), were tested on a long-term basis. Results of the study revealed that 20 kg N ha(-1) (FYM) + 25 kg N (CF) gave maximum mean rice grain yield of 1.52 t ha(-1), followed by 20 kg N (GLM) + 25 kg N (urea) with grain yield of 1.51 t ha(-1). In the case of pigeon pea, 30 kg N (FYM) + 15 kg N (urea) gave maximum pigeon pea grain yield of 0.94 t ha(-1), which was 34% greater than the sole application of chemical fertilizer. Pigeon pea grain yield tended to increase with increasing proportion of organic N in FYM + CF or GLM + CF combinations. Application of 20 kg N (FYM) + 25 kg N (urea) recorded maximum mean rice equivalent yield of 3.59 t ha(-1) and sustainability yield index of 59%. While studying profitability, application of 20 kg N (FYM)+ 25 kg N (CF) gave maximum net returns of US$168.94 ha(-1). Impact of treatments on soil quality as assessed in terms of relative soil quality indices (RSQI) increased with increasing proportion of organic sources of N. Using an innovative and new approach, an index of integrated productivity-sustainability-profitability-soil quality performance index (I-P,I-S,I-Pr,I-SQ) was computed to make a precise evaluation of the treatments. Based on this index, the order of performance of the treatments was T-6 [20 N (FYM) + 25 N (CF)] (7.7) > T-7 [30 N (FYM) + 15 N (CF) (6.9)] > T-3 [20 N (GL) + 25 N (CF)] (6.8) > T-5 [10 N (FYM) + 35 N (CF) (6.6)] > T-9 [GL] (6.5) > T-8 [CF] (6.2) > T-4 [30 N (GL) + 15 N (CF)] (6.0) > T-2 [10 N (GL) + 35 N (CF)] (5.7) > T-1 [FYM at 5 t ha(-1)] (4.1). Thus, the results and the methodology adopted in this study using long-term data would be very useful to researchers, farmers, land managers, and other stakeholders not only in India but also across the world under similar climatic and edaphic situations.

The objective of this study was to evaluate alterations in the microbial biomass, due to different soil tillage systems and intercropped cover species between rows of orange trees. The soil of the experimental area previously used as pasture (Brachiaria humidicola) was an Ultisol (Typic Paleudult) originating from Caiua sandstone in the northwestern part of the State of Parana, Brazil. Two soil tillage systems were evaluated: conventional tillage (CT) in the entire area and strip tillage (ST) (strip width 2 m), in combination with different ground cover management systems. The citrus cultivar 'Pera' orange (Citrus sinensis) grafted onto 'Rangpur' lime rootstock was used. Soil samples were collected after five years of treatment from a depth of 0-15 cm, under the tree canopy and in the inter-row, in the following treatments: (1) CT and an annual cover crop with the leguminous species Calopogonium mucunoides; (2) CT and a perennial cover crop with the leguminous peanut Arachis pintoi; (3) CT and an evergreen cover crop with Bahiagrass Paspalum notatum; (4) CT and a cover crop with spontaneous Brachiaria humidicola grass vegetation; and (5) ST and maintenance of the remaining grass (pasture) of Brachiaria humidicola. Soil tillage and the different cover species influenced the microbial biomass, both under the tree canopy and in the inter-row. The cultivation of brachiaria increased C and N in the microbial biomass, while bahiagrass increased P in the microbial biomass. The soil microbial biomass was enriched in N and P by the presence of ground cover species and according to the soil P content. The grass species increased C, N and P in the soil microbial biomass from the inter-row more than leguminous species."

It was found that tifton 85 intercropped with white oat kept its higher nutritional value after storage, with 19.78% crude protein and 70.03% of in vitro dry matter digestibility. The participation of white oat in tifton 85 area was 57.04% and for ryegrass, it was 38.52%, but the dry matter yield of single tifton 85 was higher than other intercrops. Thus, it is recommended an oversowing of winter annual species on Tifton 85, without moisture restriction, because of the benefits obtained in the hay nutritional value.

Natural enemies were most abundant in the native weed complex and pigeon pea borders; however, the spill-over of natural enemies into the neighboring crop was only observed in 2008, when predatory Coleoptera were most abundant in both the sorghum-sudangrass treatment and adjacent squash. Border crops did not influence the movement of thrips and whiteflies; however, in situ aphid counts were lower on squash bordered by sorghum-sudangrass than in the control. Flea beetles (Altica spp.) were consistently most abundant in the bare ground border, but many arthropod groups were unaffected by the treatments.

J	"Celette, F; Ripoche, A; Gary, C"				"Celette, Florian; Ripoche, Aude; Gary, Christian"			WaLIS-A simple model to simulate water partitioning in a crop association: The example of an intercropped vineyard	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Article						"Water balance; Surface runoff; Cover crop; Modelling; FTSW; Vitis vinifera L."	"SOIL HYDRAULIC-PROPERTIES; FESTUCA-ARUNDINACEA; NITROGEN; RUNOFF; GROWTH; GRAPEVINE; PLANT; INFILTRATION; FESCUE; TRANSPIRATION"	The introduction of cover crops in vineyards is being tested as it mitigates some undesirable environmental impacts of these cropping systems, such as surface runoff and soil erosion. In some cases, it could even reduce an excessive vegetative vigour of grapevine. However, most of time, wine growers are worried that severe competition for soil resources between the intercrop and grapevines could impair grape yield and quality. WaLIS (Water baLance for Intercropped Systems), a simple model simulating the water resource partitioning in such an association was designed to evaluate and optimize the water regime in intercropped systems. The model is presented and evaluated in this paper in three situations: the same grapevine cultivar (cv. Aranel) with either bare soil, or a temporary intercrop (barley) or a permanent intercrop (tall fescue). All three situations are located in the south of France. It is based on an existing model, designed to simulate the water regime of a bare soil vineyard, which was adapted to take into account the specific features of intercropped systems. Hence it includes a two-compartment representation of the soil particularly adapted to row crops. The simulation of a grass cover growth and its transpiration were added. Finally, particular importance was dedicated to the simulation of surface runoff which was the main source of the original model deviation during the winter period and made difficult multi-year simulations. Now, the model appears to be able to evaluate perennial cropping systems and provide decision support. The WaLIS model simulated the water available for both grapevine and intercrop well, and it proved to be efficient in most of the tested situations and years. The modelling of the water stress experienced by both crops was also generally good and all water fluxes simulated by the model were realistic. The main observed deviation in the simulation of the water soil content occurred during winter, i.e. outside the grapevine growth period. It was very likely clue to the use of a constant parameter value for the surface runoff which did not take into account of changes in the soil surface and their effects on water infiltration. Finally, the analysis of sensitivity made on the WaLIS model showed that it is robust and sensitive to a few parameters, which drive the maximal grapevine transpiration and soil evaporation or are linked to the surface runoff simulation. The work also revealed how a good estimate of the total soil water available for each crop is crucial. This model, easy to use and parameterise, can provide sound management advice for designing valuable intercropped cropping systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The experiment was carried out from April 2006 to July 2007, in a 3 x 5 randomized block design with split plots. The plots consisted of three banana varieties (Pacovan Ken, Caipira and Thap Maeo) and subplots of four interim crops (common bean Pearl, okra Dart, watermelon Crimson Sweet and cowpea), with three replications and a control (banana without intercrop). Altogether 756 banana plants were considered, in 45 plots, using 6 central banana plants per plot, representing the main crop. The intercrops were planted in the banana inter rows, in those with and those without the irrigation pipeline. The banana and intercrops were planted in the same period. Banana plants were spaced 3.0 m between rows and 2.0 m between plants and irrigated by micro sprinklers spaced 6 m apart. Vegetative and reproductive characteristics of the banana varieties were evaluated in the 1(st) cycle. No significant effect of the crops on the banana varieties was observed, except for the traits number of days from planting to flowering and number of days from planting to harvest of the banana varieties. The cowpea use promoted delay at the crop cycle of three varieties of banana plants Pacovan Ken, Caipira e Thap Maeo.

This study was conducted to determine whether a kura clover (Trifolium ambiguum M. Bieb.) intercropped corn system could reduce corn N fertilization need and NO3-N in the soil profile, while maintaining corn productivity. Two systems were studied at six sites in Iowa, soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]-corn intercropped with established kura clover and soybean-corn without kura clover. Six N fertilizer rates were applied to corn in each system. Excessive kura clover competition caused reduced corn population, delayed development, and reduced grain yield in 2006. More vigorous kura clover growth suppression in 2007 resulted in similar yield between the kura clover and no-kura clover systems, with greater yield in the intercropped kura clover at a site with coarse-textured soil. The kura clover system did not reduce corn N fertilization requirement, as measured by response in plant N stress and grain yield. The kura clover also did not influence NO3-N in the soil profile before, during, or after the growing season. These results differ from other studies where kura clover intercropping has reduced corn N fertilization need and not reduced corn yield. Intercropping corn with kura clover posed the challenge of sufficiently suppressing the clover to allow successful corn establishment and production, and in addition did not provide potential benefits such as reduced N fertilization requirement or less NO3-N in the soil profile.

The model includes terms for primary infection, secondary infection, inoculum decay, and root growth. The average rates of root production did not vary with cropping history. The force of primary infection increased from a low level in 1st wheat crops, to a maximum in 2nd to 4th wheat crops, and then to intermediate levels thereafter. The force of secondary infection was low but increased steadily during the season in first wheat crops, was delayed but rose and fell sharply in 2nd to 4th wheat crops, and for 5th and 7th wheat crops returned to similar dynamics as that for 1st wheat crops. Chemical seed treatment with silthiofam had no consistent effect on the take-all decline process. We conjecture that these results are consistent with (i) low levels of particulate inoculum prior to the first wheat crop leading to low levels of primary infection, low levels of secondary infection, and little disease suppression; (ii) net amplification of inoculum during the first wheat crop and intercrop period; (iii) increased levels of primary and secondary infection in subsequent crops, but higher levels of disease suppression; and (iv) an equilibrium between the pathogen and antagonist populations by the 5th wheat, reflected by lower overall rates of primary infection, secondary infection, disease suppression and hence, disease severity."

Relative Competitiveness of Soybean against Red-Rice	PLANTA DANINHA			Portuguese	Article						"substitution series; competition; Oryza sativa; Glycine max"	"INTERFERENCE; CULTIVARS"	To reduce weed plant infestation, especially red-rice, areas traditionally cultivated with flooded rice in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, are being intercropped with soybean under a rotation system. The objective of this study was to quantify competitive abilities between soybean crop and red-rice biotype. Treatments were arranged in substitution series, with five proportions being used (0: 16, 4:12, 8:8. 12:4 and 16:0) of soybean and red-rice, in a randomized complete block design, with four replications. Air dry matter and leaf area of the plants Were evaluated. Competitiveness was analyzed through diagrams applied to substitution experiments and competitiveness indexes. Soybean presents higher competitive ability for environment resources than red-rice. Soybean crop production increases when close to a red-rice plant than to a soybean plant.	"[Moraes, P. V.

Intercrop effects on weed community structure have rarely been studied. A 6-yr study was initiated in 1999 and the response of aboveground weed flora (1999-2002 and 2005) and seed bank (2005) to the intercropping of saffron and black zira, two perennial crops was investigated. Mixtures consisted of 0/100, 25/75, 50/50, 75/25, and 100/0 saffron/black zira ratios, each planted at three densities: 30, 50, and 70 plant m(-2). The effect of planting density on weed populations was variable and in most cases not significant. However, mixture ratios caused drastic species compositional changes in the weed community for which univariate and multivariate analyses explored four major associations: (1) weeds that favored a higher ratio of saffron in mixtures (e.g., grasses, field bindweed, pigweeds), (2) weeds that preferred a higher ratio of black zira in mixtures (e.g., Persian speedwell, Brassicaceae complex, Polygoaceae complex, and carthsmoke), (3) weeds that were more abundant in 50/50 mixtures (e.g., Caryophyllaceae complex), and (4) weeds that showed no specific pattern (e.g., common lambsquarterss). Pigweeds, prostrate knotweed, and common lambsquarters dominated the viable seed bank with relative densities of 48, 28, and 8%, respectively. The seed bank of most weed species responded to mixture ratios in a similar manner to those of their corresponding aboveground flora. Seed density decreased as soil depth increased, leading to the accumulation of 66, 22, and 12% of viable seeds in soil layers of 0-5, 5-15 and 15-25 cm, respectively. Greater weed and seed densities were found in more pure stands of black zira. These findings contribute to improving current understanding of crop-weed community structures and may help in developing weed management practices.

The interaction of chemical controlintercropping had a significant effect on the most community structure parameters of insect pest and natural enemy communities, except for the diversity index of the predator community. The damage index for the insect pest community and control index of the natural enemy community were also affected significantly by the chemical controlintercropping interaction. Pearson correlation analyzes showed that community structure and productivity of insect pest and predator communities had a complex relationship with lower trophic productivity in these cotton agroecosystems. Few effects of chemical control on these correlations were found. Chemical methods influenced the correlations between insect pest community productivity and parasitoid community structure in most cotton agroecosystems. Our results suggest that the interaction of chemical controlintercropping significantly influenced the damage index, the control index, and the correlation between community structure and productivity of insect pest and natural enemy communities in cotton agroecosystems.

An agroecosystem modeled after nature should encompass greater stability and biodiversity at all levels of organization than an agroecosystem based on conventional agricultural practices. The main objective of this study was to determine whether agroecosystems modeled after nature exhibit advantages over conventional agroecosystems. Five treatments were examined: winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) monoculture, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) monoculture, strip-cropped alfalfa and wheat, and two alfalfa-wheat intercrops (one no-till and one conservation-till). Indicators of ecosystem function studied included primary productivity, soil fertility, plant nitrogen (N) concentration, and abundances of arthropod pests and predators. No fertilizers or pesticides were used prior to or during this investigation. Monoculture, strip-crop and conservation-till treatments produced significantly higher yields than no-till intercropped alfalfa and wheat. Although yields from the no-till intercrop were low, wheat protein values were comparable to other treatments. Soil N concentrations tended to be high in treatments containing alfalfa. Insect pests preferred alfalfa and were, therefore, often more abundant in treatments containing high percentages of alfalfa, as were predators such as spiders. Researching alternatives to monoculture agroecosystems, such as the intercrop systems in this study, may provide us insight into a true natural systems agriculture.

The drip system of irrigation had good effects on plant survival but overall plant vigour was not influenced much in juvenile peach plants, compared to rainfed controls in a humid subtropical climate. Besides 122.40 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) average leaf litter production, 346.80 k ha(-1) fuel wood could be obtained from annual pruning of peach plants (T-4). Highest fruit yield was obtained in T-4 (3761.84 kg ha(-1)) and lowest under rainfed control (1651.50 kg ha(-1)). Intercropping of urd (Phaseolus vulgaris, var. T-9) in the rainy season, i.e., June-September (Kharif) and toria (Brassica campestris, var. Pant-303) in winter season, i.e., October-January (Rabi) was a compatible combination with peach plantation, but growing of toria in Rabi season crop was uneconomical on highly gravely sites (T-1). The yield of the Rabi season crop (toria) was affected by the rainfall distribution pattern during the crop-growing period, but not Kharif season crop (urd). However, urd showed poor response under tree canopy relative to that away from the canopy cover of the overstorey component (peach). By adopting an urdtoria rotation coupled with drip irrigation for peach plants only, a net return of > U.S. $235.00 ha(-1) yr(-1) could be obtained even under rainfed cropping. The net return of U.S. $641.49 was obtained by this agric-hortic system on deeper soil profiles (T-4) compared to U.S. $251.44 on shallower soil profiles (T-1). The system responded fairly well under rainfed conditions (T-5), but a 66% higher net return could be obtained by adopting better management practices (T-4). From this study, it is concluded that a peach-based agric-hortic system is an economically viable and sustainable land use system with multiple outputs for the degraded foothills of the Himalayan subtropics.

Data on nitrogen fixation, production, crop nitrogen off-take and competition effects came from two seasons of fieldwork. Supplementary data were taken from secondary sources. The model was used as a tool to attempt to identify grain legume management options with the potential to make significant contributions to soil fertility. The crop parameters pearl millet grain yield, nitrogen fixation rates, nitrogen harvest index and biomass production were found to be critical in determining system nitrogen inputs and outputs as was the form of residue management. The model indicated that it is extremely difficult to manage grain legumes in dryland environments in ways that lead to consistent increases in pearl millet grain yields, measurable against season-to-season variation due to other factors. Several of the options for improved legume management conflict strongly with farmers' risk-avoidance strategies and their tendency to invest preferentially in off farm activities in an environment where livelihoods have diversified considerably away from agriculture. Potential routes for increasing grain legume contributions to soil fertility in dryland areas are discussed.

J	Mogahed, MI				Mogahed, MI			Influence of intercropoing on population dynamics of major insect-pests of potato (Solanum tuberosum) in North Sinai Governorate, Egypt	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						"intdrcropping; pests; population dynamics; potato pests; sticky trap"		A field experiment was conducted during the winter season (from December to April) of 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 at Oam Shyhan area, and a field belonging to private sector, Al-Arish area, Sinai Governorate, Egypt. Tubers of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) varieties ('Nkola' and 'Sponta') were planted in alternate rows of each associated crops, viz onion (Allium cepa L.) and garlic (Allium sativum L.). The sticky paper traps were erected in experimental field to catch the cotton white-fly (Bemisia tabaci Gennandius), cotton or onion thrips (Thrips tabaci Lind.), green peach potato leaf aphid (Myzus persicae Sulzer) and potato leaf hopper (Empoasca discipiens Paoli). The potato varieties ('Nkola' and 'Sponta') when raised as an intercrop had lesser infestation of cotton white-fly, cotton thrips, potato leaf aphids, and potato leaf hoppers than the same varieties of potato grown alone. When both the varieties raised alone had higher infestation of the tested insects than intercropped potato. Intercropping potato plants ('Nkola' and 'Sponta') with onion or garlic plants consistently produced the lowest infestation levels. Based on the yield data, the impact of intercropping of potato varieties was in descending order of 'Sponta' + onion (6857.1 kg/ha), 'Sponta' + garlic (5142.9 kg/ha-6571.4 kg/ha), followed by 'Nkola' + onion (3142.9 kg/ha). The average yield of potato tubers in the plots of potato grown alone was 628.6 kg/ha for 'Nkola' and 2409.5 kg/ha for 'Sponta'. Thus average yield of potato was significantly higher in intercropped plots compared to those which contained sole crop of potato.

J	"Schmidt, O; Clements, RO; Donaldson, G"				"Schmidt, O; Clements, RO; Donaldson, G"			Why do cereal-legume intercrops support large earthworm populations?	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY			English	Article						"cover crop; direct drilling; food rcsources; Lumbricidae; living mulch; slurry fertilizer; tillage"	"NITROGENOUS FERTILIZERS; OCTET-METHOD; ARABLE LAND; PIG SLURRY; CULTIVATION; LUMBRICIDAE; OLIGOCHAETA; GRASSLAND; ABUNDANCE; CATTLE"	The relative importance of reduced soil disturbance and increased food supply in supporting large earthworm populations in cereal-legume intercropping systems was investigated in two replicated field experiments over a 3-year period. In the first experiment, the effects of the absence of tillage and the presence of a permanent white clover understorey on earthworm populations were assessed in three winter wheat cropping systems. The mean earthworm abundance as assessed by electrical extraction in conventional wheat, direct drilled wheat and direct-drilled wheat-clover intercrops was 211, 280 and 572 individuals m(-2) and the corresponding earthworm biomass was 62, 92 and 203 g m(-2). In the second experiment, the effects of dairy cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer applications on earthworm populations in wheat-clover intercropping systems were assessed. Neither the input of additional organic matter (as slurry) nor mineral N fertilization increased earthworm population levels which were already remarkably high, averaging 1097 individuals m(-2) and 266 g biomass m(-2) in the third year of the experiment. These results suggest that while the absence of ploughing alone had only a modest effect, the combination of absence of ploughing and presence of a clover understorey increased earthworm populations greatly. It is concluded that cereal-legume intercrops support large earthworm populations primarily because the organic matter input from such systems is favourable for earthworms in terms of quantity, quality and continuity of food supply throughout the year.

Treatments were compared with 'Garry' oats (Avena sativa) or continuous 'Honeoye' strawberries at two sites in Connecticut. Lesion nematode (Pratylenchus penetrans) recovery was greater from Garry oats than for strawberry, Saia oats or sorgho-sudangrass. Bait root infection by Rhizoctonia fragariae was highest for strawberry. Weed density was inversely related to rotation crop density. White grub larvae were most common in strawberry. Rotation crop did not affect isolation of Rhizoctonia or Pythium in 1996 or 1997. Weed growth in plots in 1996 was suppressed after sorgho-sudangrass in 1995, but not in 1997. Intercropping was similar to herbicide application, but only when the intercrop was present. Rotation crop did not affect pathogen recovery from roots of 2-year old strawberry crowns. Numbers of European chafer larvae were greatest in Saia oats, which may have been attractive to gravid females. Japanese and Asiatic garden beetle populations were positively correlated with soil organic matter. Rhizosphere populations of fluorescent pseudomonads were unaffected by treatment. Fruit yield (1997) was greatest in plots previously planted to Garry or Saia oats and least after sorgho-sudangrass, possibly due to phytotoxic properties of residues. Production of rotation crops such as sorgho-sudangrass or Saia oats may suppress. pathogen densities, weeds, and white grub densities prior to planting strawberries but may also adversely affect strawberry growth and yield.

R.BR.), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.), and groundnut (Arachis hypogea L.). Four N levels and rotation treatments including continuous fallow were investigated. Soil samples taken from the top 20 cm depth at the end of the experiment from treatments without nitrogen application which included continuous fallow, fallow-millet rotation, groundnut-millet rotation, cowpea-millet rotation, and continuous millet were analysed for soil pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen and exchangeable bases. Fertilizer N significantly increased yield of pearl millet, cowpea and groundnut. Continuous monocropping of pearl millet resulted in lower yields across N levels compared to legume-millet rotations. Legume yields were also consistently lower in monoculture than when rotated with millet. There was a decline in organic matter under continuous millet, cowpea-millet rotation and groundnut-millet rotation. The fallow-millet rotation supplied more mineral N than the legume-millet rotations. Nitrogen availability was greater in cowpea-millet rotation than continuous millet. Crop rotation was more productive than the continuous monoculture but did not differ in maintaining soil organic matter. The legume-millet rotation at 30 kg/ha N appears to be the most viable for millet production. Research should focus on understanding the effect of legume/cereal intercrops and rotations on soil productivity.

There were 48 treatments, altogether, 24 with chlorsulfuron and 24 with glyphosate. Each set of 24 was designed as 2 x 3 x 4 factorial with 1) plus or minus Glomus mosseae, 2) soybean alone, weed alone or soybean plus weed combination, 3) herbicide applied at the rates 0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1 x the field recommendation dose. The shoot dry mass of AM soybean treated with low doses of herbicides, when grown together with B. campestris or S. halepensis, but not when grown alone, was increased. This fact together with the absence of an increase in plant dry mass in intercropped non-AM soybean plants, suggest that the AM fungus mediates nutrient transfer from weeds to soybean. Neither herbicide affected AM colonization of plants except when glyphosate was applied at field recommendation dose to the weed S. halepensis grown as an intercrop. The most beneficial effect of G. mosseae on soybean was found when chlorsulfuron and glyphosate were applied at low doses, but this beneficial effect disappeared when the herbicides were applied at high doses.

The objective of this study was to determine if the VAM fungus Glomus deserticola Trappe, Bless and Menge enhanced such a transfer in a crop-weed association when one associated plant was selectively weakened by an herbicide. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) or perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) plants were grown with or without VAM fungi either in monocultures, or together as an intercrop for 7 weeks, when the herbicide diclofop was applied as a soil drench at dose rates of 0%, 10%, 50%, 100% and 1000% of the field recommendation (0.9 kg ha(-1)). Seed yield at harvest (13 weeks) was significantly greater for the +VAM than for the -VAM intercropped wheat plants at all dose rates. When grown in monoculture, wheat yield was greater in the -VAM plants. Shoot growth of intercropped +VAM wheat was enhanced, while that of ryegrass was inhibited. In monoculture, the plant dry masses of both -VAM wheat and ryegrass were greater than those of the +VAM plants, while in intercrop the +VAM wheat plants fared better. The data showed that (1) the herbicide inhibited root colonization by C. deserticola in wheat but not in ryegrass, and (2) when grown together, wheat growth and yield were enhanced and ryegrass growth was inhibited in +VAM herbicide-treated associations. We interpret the findings as a change in interplant source-sink relations upon treatment with diclofop: ryegrass roots became sources of nutrients to the tolerant wheat roots (stronger sinks), and the transfer process was enhanced by the VAM mycelium common to both.

At the same site, however, a preplanting soil amendment consisting of urea (200 kg ha(-1) N) and CaO (5000 kg ha(-1)) significantly reduced the pathogen population and tomato bacterial wilt (P < 0.001). The effect of the soil amendment was not consistent when applied to soil from three other sites in Taiwan; in soil from two sites no reduction of the pathogen population occurred. At these sites, tomato bacterial wilt in the field was not reduced significantly after amending. In comparison with a non-amended control, the addition of only CaO reduced the P. solanacearum population in AVRDC soil significantly (P < 0.05), but the reduction was significantly greater when the complete soil amendment was added. In contrast, urea alone did not affect the survival of P. solanacearum in the soil. In a greenhouse experiment with AVRDC soil, P. solanacearum was undetectable 2 weeks after soil amendment, but in the same treatment tomato yield was significantly reduced by 48% (P < 0.05) compared with non-amended treatments. The suppressive effect of the soil amendment on the P. solanacearum population was probably due to the generation of one or several toxic substances during the transformation of urea in the presence of CaO."

Assuming different probabilities of crop failure for one or both of the crops, the model provided a comparison of long-term intercrop and sole crop yields from intercropping systems of oat-mustard, mustard-bean and oat-bean. It showed that if failure was restricted to only one of the crop species, intercropping suffered less yield decline with increasing probability of failure than did sole cropping only if there was a sufficiently high yield of the surviving crop. However, in the more realistic situation where each crop was subjected to the possibility of failure, this decline in yield was less in intercropping than sole cropping for all three combinations because poor yields when one species was the surviving crop were offset by good yields when the other species was the survivor. Mustard-oat and mustard-bean gave no yield advantage in the absence of failure (Land Equivalent Ratios less than 1) but they outyielded sole cropping for failure probabilities above about 5% and 15%, respectively. All combinations gave large intercropping advantages at high probabilities of failure. Oat-bean always had a strong yield advantage, even with no failure. The model is very simplistic but it illustrates the potential for modelling long-term effects from field data. Limitations of the model are discussed and it is emphasized that these can be overcome if information to make the underlying assumptions more realistic is available.

The normal-sewn rice (Oryza sativa (L.) intercropped with sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) was more compatible and advantageous than other combinations. The highest yield recovery of rice (94.8% and sesame (83.3%) was recorded from this system. Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and blackgram or urdbean (Phaseolus mungo L.) were equally competitive with normal or paired-row-sown rice, but reduced the yield of rice by 7.8 and 11% in normal sown and 10.9 and 10.5% in paired-row-sown rice respectively. All the growth parameters and yield attributes of rice were favourably more under sole cropping, followed by normal rice intercropped with sesame. This combination recorded the highest rice-equivalent yield (48.09 q/ha) and yield advantage (78%), followed by paired rice + sesame intercropping system.

J	"Fortin, MC; Pierce, FJ"				"Fortin, MC; Pierce, FJ"			Leaf azimuth in strip-intercropped corn	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article								In strip-intercropping conditions where rows of corn (Zea mays L.) are subjected to widely different levels of radiation interception and of water and nutrient competition, leaf azimuthal direction may be an important determinant of yield. Observations of ear leaf direction were made on two outside rows and one middle row of a corn strip grown with small-grain cereal and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] strip-intercrops in four trials with north-south rows in Ontario and Michigan. The objectives were to assess if row position within the strip and seed orientation at planting affect leaf azimuth and to find out if ear leaf azimuth and yield are related, In only one of the four trials was there a correlation between yield and the frequency of ears from ear leaves pointing in a specific direction (west). In both locations, row position affected the proportion of ear leaves in a direction perpendicular to the row and toward the inside of the strip rather than toward the outside in the case of border rows, When seed orientation at planting was controlled, 60 to 74% of ear leaves (leaves 11 or 12) developed in the same direction as the embryo orientation or opposite this orientation, Random orientation of the seed resulted in random ear leaf azimuths, except in a very dry growing season, when leaf azimuthal directions were mostly parallel to row direction, minimizing interception of radiation. This suggests that leaf azimuth could be an indicator of water deficit.

'T 9' blackgram (Phaseolus mungo L.) increased seed-cotton yield significantly during 1988-89 in paired-row planting compared with sole American cotton. The significant decrease in seed-cotton yield owing to intercrop of 'JS 71-05' soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] was observed in all the planting systems during both the years. The reduction in seed-cotton yield was identical in 'SS 2' soybean and greengram (P. radiatus L.) but less than 'JS 71-05' soybean. Higher monetary gain was found in intercropping systems than in sole cropping of American cotton. The intercropping of blackgram between a pair of American cotton was more remunerative without affecting the yield of main crop. The maximum net returns (Rs 9,207/ha) as well as benefit: cost ratio (3.48) were achieved in this system. Blackgram in 2:2 row ratio had maximum average bolls (10.30) and seed-cotton yield (29.66 g/plant), whereas sowing of greengram between a pair of American cotton and American cotton + 'JS 71-05' soybean in 2:1 row systems were found at par in average boll size (3.33 g).

Rice, soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], blackgram (Phaseolous mungo L), greengram (P. radialus L) and pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] were sown in sole and 2: 1 intercrop combination. Rice + pigeonpea was the best system, followed by rice + soybean with rice-equivalent yield of 2.665 and 2.478 tonnes/ha compared with 2.254 tonnes/ha from rice alone. Pigeonpea and soybean were better-suited crops than rice for this type of soil. Competition ratio indicated rice as the dominated component in combination with pigeonpea, but with blackgram and greengram both the components were nearly equally competitive. Soil-nitrogen enrichment through legume cultivation contributed to higher yield of the succceding indian mustard [Brassica juncea (L.) Czernj. & Cosson] crop.

West Bengal, to investigate the effect of pigeonpea cultivars and their planting pattern on the performance of a groundnut-pigeonpea intercrop. In intercropping the crops were also sown at 100% population of their sole crops. Groundnut plant growth and development was affected by intercropping with pigeonpea and the decline in pod yield ranged from 7 to 50 % of the sole crop yield. The compact, short-statured and short duration pigeonpea cultivar, ICPL87, intercepted only 50 % of the incoming solar radiation as against the 70 % intercepted by LRG30 at the peak vegetative stage. The significantly higher groundnut yield (48 %) obtained from the intercrop with the former pigeonpea cultivar as compared to the latter justifies the belief that the performance of the groundnut was light-related. This was further confirmed when the light interception by pigeonpea was reduced by increasing the row spacing from 90 to 150 cm and there was a consequent increase in groundnut yield. The cultivar and row arrangement of pigeonpea that allowed equal utilization of light by both crops gave increased productivity.

The 332-day, four-component intercropping systems, modeled after the traditional planting scheme of the local farmers, and five sole-crops systems of near-equal duration were studied under four N regimes (0, 80, 160 and 240 kg ha-1 on nonlegumes) on a Typic Paleudult in the upper Amazon basin (Yurimaguas, Peru) to test the above hypothesis. Test species were com (Zea mays L.), upland rice (Oryza sativa L.), peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) and cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz). Each intercropped system included one production cycle of the four test species. One sole-cropped system was cassava; the others were three production cycles of sequentially-planted, short-cycle food crops (corn, rice or peanut). Production rates by the seven cropping systems were evaluated on the basis of gross product yield, total biomass and revenue generation. No intercropping system was more productive than sole crops of its intercrop components. As generators of disposable income, furthermore, each four-component intercropping system was substantially less productive than any sole-cropped system except cassava. When the intercrop data were evaluated as two-component systems, it was determined that the low productivity of the two four-crop systems tested was due to cassava-rice (LER = 0.82) or cassava-peanut (LER = 0.90) portion. The cassava intercrops did not provide any direct benefit for the com-peanut portion (LER = 1.25). This suggested that a two-crop system consisting of a legume-nonlegume intercrop of short-cycle food crops, would be worthy of commercial exploitation in a humid tropical environment. However, to ensure the sustainability of the system, it would be necessary to prevent disease build up. Response to N by com was maximal between 80 and 160 kg ha-1 in all systems. The N response pattern for sole-cropped cassava was positive and linear, but it was virtually flat in the intercrops. The effect of N on rice grain yields was either nil or negative in both sole crop and intercrop. There was no measurable effect of N regime on intercrop efficiency."

These results are attributed to the long period, after the harvest of the intercropped pearl millet, over which long-duration pigeonpea can compensate for any differential competitive effects at early growth stages. The major factor determining yield appeared to be length of growing period, which was in tum determined by genotype and the environmental conditions following pearl millet harvest.

Field studies were conducted at three Michigan locations to quantify N accumulation by alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) frost-seeded into winter wheat or interseeded with oat (A vena sativa L.), and to evaluate the response of a subsequent corn (Zea mays L.) crop to legume and fertilizer N. Cropping sequences included corn following either wheat, wheat frost-seeded with a legume, oat, or oat interseeded with a legume. Corn was planted either no-till following wheat or conventionally (moldboard plow) following oat. Frost-seeding and interseeding alfalfa and red clover had no effect on small grain yield, and stands of alfalfa and red clover were adequate (> 13 plants/sq ft) even though N fertilizer had been applied to the small grains. Nitrogen accumulation did not differ among alfalfa or red clover cultivars, and averaged 80, 50, and 116 lb N/acre for alfalfa; and 96, 99, and 176 lb N/acre for red clover frost-seeded into winter wheat at the three locations. When interseeded with oat, alfalfa contained an average of 44 lb N/acre and red clover contained an average of 33 lb N/acre prior to fall plowing. Corn response to the frost-seeded legumes differed among locations due primarily to differences in precipitation during the weeks just prior to and following corn planting. When soil water was adequate, corn grain yields following the small grain seeded with a legume were 4 to 62% greater than following the small grain without the legume. With below-normal precipitation following corn planting, corn grain yields in the legume systems were reduced by 3 to 27%, primarily due to delayed and reduced emergence. Fertilizer replacement values based on grain yield ranged from 0 to 49 lb N/acre for alfalfa and from 0 to 113 lb N/acre for red clover.

COMPETITION BETWEEN COMPONENT CROPS UNDER 3 INTERCROPPING CONDITIONS	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article							"SORGHUM; YIELD"	Seven contrasting cassava cultivars were grown in sole-cropping and in intercropping with soybean and with pigeonpea to examine how associated crop species affect the performance of intercropping. In cassava/pigeonpea intercropping, time of pigeonpea sowing and plant density were altered in two experiments. In Experiment 1, four rows of pigeonpea were sown between cassava rows at cassava planting. In Experiment 2, two rows of pigeonpea or soybean were sown at 35 days after cassava planting. In Experiment 1, cassava emerged later than pigeonpea. Canopy width of cassava did not increase once the cassava interrow was occupied by pigeonpea. Total dry-matter production of all cassava cultivars was severely affected in intercropping by the time of pigeonpea harvest. Subsequent recovery was slow and final tuber yield in all cultivars was less than 25% of the corresponding yield in solecrop. When the competitive ability of pigeonpea was reduced in Experiment 2, only a short cassava cultivar was affected severely by pigeonpea, and its recovery was poor after pigeonpea harvest. Tall cultivars gradually became much taller than pigeonpea, and in most cultivars tuber yields were reduced by only up to 30%. However, the pigeonpea was almost completely suppressed by these cassava cultivars, and its seed yield was very poor. Total solar radiation intercepted by the two species combined in intercropping was similar to that of sole cassava, but combined biomass production of the two species was lower. Harvest index of cassava cultivars was also reduced slightly by intercropped pigeonpea. It was concluded that the two species competed with each other for too long, and there was yield loss of cassava/pigeonpea intercropping over sole-cropping with any cassava cultivars, except one (MCol 1468) which was strongly competitive and produced a full cassava yield in intercropping. The soybean cultivar used in Experiment 2 was short-statured and quick maturing, and had little adverse effect on growth and tuber yield of any cassava cultivar. Radiation available to the soybean, and hence soybean growth and seed yield, was greatly reduced by tall cassava cultivars. Short or compact cassava cultivars, on the other hand, affected growth of soybean less severely, and in some cases their tuber yield was increased by the associated soybean.

SELECTION CRITERIA FOR CASSAVA GENOTYPES IN INTERCROPPING WITH 2 CONTRASTING LEGUME CROPS	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article							"CROPPING SYSTEM; YIELD; COWPEA; GROWTH; PLANT"	"An experiment was conducted to determine selection criteria for cassava genotypes for intercropping with legumes using 18 cassava cultivars which are contrasting in canopy size. Two legume crops were used; one a short-statured, quick-maturing soybean, and the other, a tall, late-maturing pigeonpea. They were sown at 37 days after cassava planting in double rows between cassava rows. Intercropped soybean had little adverse effect on crop growth and tuber yield of cassava, and in some cases it enhanced tuber yield of cassava cultivars with small compact canopies. The effect of cassava on soybean yield was least with short-statured, small cassava cultivars as solar radiation available to the soybean was highest. As the canopy development of cassava was hardly affected by soybean in any cultivars, the selection of cassava genotypes can be made in sole-cropping with selection criteria of high tuber yield and narrow canopy width measured at about 90 days after cassava planting. Intercropped pigeonpea had an adverse effect on canopy development and tuber yield of cassava, particularly of short-statured cultivars. Whilst tall cultivars with spreading canopy were least affected by pigeonpea, they reduced seed yield of pigeonpea to a very low level. It was therefore difficult to determine cassava types suitable for this intercropping. When strongly competitive species, such as pigeonpea, are to be intercropped with cassava, selection can be made initially in sole-cropping with selection criteria of high tuber yield and height which is at least similar to that of the associated crop. The results show that ideal cassava cultivars for intercropping depend on competitive ability of associated species. It is suggested that competitiveness of component crops should be identified using a few cassava cultivars under typical growing conditions before selection is carried out."

CONTRASTING LEAF WATER RELATIONS	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							"AMERICANUM L LEEKE; PENNISETUM-AMERICANUM; YIELD; COMPETITION; ADAPTATION; PRESSURE; DROUGHT; SORGHUM; STRESS; PLANTS"	Cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] can survive soil water deficits more effectively than pearl millet [Pennisetum americanum (L.) Leeke]. Cowpea and millet were grown in a glasshouse in different rooting media and different sizes of container, under wet and dry treatments, and as sole crops and intercrops to evaluate any differences in leaf water potential. Millet developed significantly lower predawn leaf water potentials (PSI(L)) than cowpea under the dry treatment of all of the rooting media and container sizes used, but both millet and cowpea maintained higH predawn PSI(L) in the well-watered treatment. With the dry treatment, the same difference in predawn PSI(L) between cowpea and milLet developed in plants grown either as sole crops or as intercrops in the same pot. These results suggest that plants grown as intercrops were somehow isolated from each other, even though their root systems may have overlapped, and that competition for water was probably not occurring. Differences in predawn PSI(L) between cowpea and millet were detected with either a pressure chamber or psychrometers, but values of PSI(L) varied with measurement method. Compared with psychrometer values, pressure chamber values became significantly lower in millet late in the dry treatment but were higher in cowpea. Agreement between the methods for measuring PSI(L) improved in cowpea when predawn xylem osmotic potential was added to the pressure chamber value. At the end of the experiments, leaf surface conductance to water vapour and leaf area were lower in millet than cowpea. Consequently, it is possible that the significantly lower predawn PSI(L) in millet was not due to greater water use by millet compared with cowpea.

EXTENT OF PREDAWN EQUILIBRIUM IN LEAF WATER POTENTIAL	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article								Pearl millet [Pennisetum americanum (L.) Leeke] consistently develops lower predawn leaf water potentials than cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] when plants are subjected to progressive soil drying, even when they are grown as intercrops in the same pot. Lack of equilibrium in water potential during the predawn, within the plants and between plants and soil, was studied as a possible explanation for this difference. Experiments were conducted in a glasshouse in pots containing an artificial rooting medium which had a high water-holding capacity and was easy to separate from roots. Leaf and root predawn xylem water potentials were measured with a pressure chamber. In cowpea, leaf water potential (PSI(L)) values during the dry treatment were similar to values of root water potential (PSI(R)), indicating an approximate equilibrium within the plants. In millet, measurements were made on plants grown in both large and small pots. With large pots, PSI(L) and PSI(R) values in millet were similar, but with small pots, predawn PSI(L) was lower than PSI(R). When the surfaces of these small pots were covered with evaporation barriers, however, no significant differences developed between PSI(L) and PSI(R) at predawn during soil drying, indicating an approximate equilibrium within millet. During the early stages of the dry treatment, leaf surface conductances measured at predawn indicated that significant water flux occurred at night from the leaves of both cowpea and millet. Leaf surface conductances declined to negligible levels as the dry treatment progressed, however, and night-time fluxes of water from leaves cannot explain the significant difference in predawn PSI(L) that developed between cowpea and millet. In order to determine whether the lower predawn PSI(L) in millet was due to a resistance to water uptake at the root surface, an osmoticum (-0.5 MPa mannitol solution) was applied to pots of cowpea and millet intercrops after substantial differences in predawn PSI(L) had developed, and PSI(L) was measured. Measurements taken 9 h later indicated that predawn PSI(L) had recovered in millet, and the values of PSI(L) in millet and cowpea after mannitol treatment were similar to the osmotic potential of the mannitol solution. These results suggest that the lower predawn PSI(L) in millet than in cowpea under drought is due to the development of a substantial soil resistance to water movement to the root surfaces of millet.

Such intraspecific specialization can be caused either by genetic differences or by the effects of experience (conditioning) on a given host plant. Separating the causes of intraspecific variation in host use is an important issue in understanding the potential for host shifts in herbivorous species. In the pea aphid, a polyphagous pest of forage crops, various clones collected from a local area have been shown to be specialized such that they have higher fitness on either alfalfa or red clover. The experiment reported here was designed to test whether this observed specialization could be significantly altered by prolonged experience on the alternate plant species. In a factorial design, replicate lineages of two specialized clones were maintained on both alfalfa and red clover for three generations; each line was then tested on both crops. Experience on the alternate crop had no significant effect on the relative performance of these two specialized clones. These results support the suggestion that differences in host plant performance among pea aphid clones are genetically based. They also suggest that individuals that move between crops are likely to be selected against, since they appear to be unable to significantly improve in performance through time as a result of experience. Such selective elimination of intercrop migrants will promote genetic divergence of nearby subpopulations on different crops."

J	"MOOMAW, RS; POWELL, TA"				"MOOMAW, RS; POWELL, TA"			MULTIPLE CROPPING SYSTEMS IN SMALL GRAINS IN NORTHEAST NEBRASKA	JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE			English	Article								Relay intercropping soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] into small grain has been suggested as a way to move multiple cropping further north, or as an alternative to conventional doublecropping in the lower Midwest. Our objective was to compare conventional monocrop soybean, grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], and forage sorghum with relay intercropping and doublecropping in oat (Avena sativa L.) or winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Field experiments were conducted from 1982 through 1986 in northeast Nebraska at 42.2-degrees latitude, 97-degrees longitude, further north and west than the usual multiple cropping regions. Skip-row spacings every fourth drill row were left in the small grain where relay intercrops were later planted in 28- or 30-in. spacings. All doublecropping followed removal of oat or winter wheat for forage, while with relay intercropping, cereals were harvested for grain. Weed control in a relay intercropping system also was investigated. Averaged over the eight location-years, small grain yields with relay intercropping were reduced 34% compared to solid-seeded monoculture yield because of wheel traffic damage and the skip-row spacing effect. Average soybean yield with relay intercropping and doublecropping was 28% of conventional monoculture yield and relay intercropping was never superior to sequential doublecropping. Similar results were found with grain sorghum as relay intercropping and doublecrop yields averaged 15% of conventional grain sorghum. Relay intercrop and doublecrop forage sorghum yielded 37% and 54% of monoculture forage sorghum. Relay intercropping may make it possible at more northern latitudes to harvest cereal crops for grain rather than for forage as is usually done in a double-crop system, which would be advantageous for cash grain producers. Satisfactory weed control was achieved in the relay intercrop system by applying herbicide on the green wheat or oats plus row banding herbicide at crop planting. Economic analyses indicated that monocrop systems generally provided greater returns than relay intercrop or doublecrop systems. Returns in the doublecrop system were more favorable than with relay intercropping, particularly with the wheat-forage sorghum crops. Relay intercropping requires that many cultural practices be meshed for successful results.

Mixtures are grown and persist because they prolong harvest and income flow and provide diversity of diet. From our review of research on agronomic and disease aspects of mixtures in modern agriculture, it is also clear that improved stability and decreased disease severity are common features of mixtures relative to their components in monoculture. Such advantages are of value to both modern and subsistence agriculture. However, in the majority of cases, the yield advantage of mixtures is small. Overall, we conclude that varietal mixtures are presently a viable strategy for sustainable productivity in subsistence agriculture, have potential for improvement without sacrifice of diversity, are an important resource for future global food production and may have an expanding role in modern agriculture in situations where qualitative uniformity is not the guiding priority.

We used nationally representative household panel survey data from Zambia to estimate the differential effects on cereal-growing households of incorporating grain legumes into their farms via cereal-legume intercropping, cereal-legume rotation, and other means (such as legume monocropping). Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that with all else equal, cereal-growing small-scale farm households that integrate grain legumes into their production systems have: (1) more availability of food as measured by total production of calories and protein; (2) more income from crop production or sales; and (3) increased food access. Results suggest that cereal-legume rotation was associated with statistically significant increases in production of calories and protein by a household as well as their gross value of crop sales; it may also improve their food access. In contrast, we found little evidence of statistically significant effects of cereal-legume intercropping and other forms of legume production on household food availability and access in Zambia."

Grown with Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L.) under Raised and Sunken Bed Systems	AGRONOMY-BASEL			English	Article						"raised-sunken bed; irrigation; yield; water productivity"	"YIELD; CONFIGURATION"	"The underground water and water storage reservoirs are rapidly depleting due to nominal recharging by the rainfalls making water a scarce resource for irrigation resulting in poor crop growth and production. Irrigation water application should focus on the proficient use of each drop of water. Water productivity (WP) in agriculture can be improved through crop diversification, proper land and water management techniques. Considering this, a field investigation was carried out during 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 to study the crop response of rice (Oryza sativa L.) + okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L.) system to land configurations and irrigation regimes. Three raised-sunken beds (RSB) having width (m) ratios of 1:3, 2:3, 3:3 and two irrigation schedules viz. continuous standing water (CSW) of 5 & PLUSMN; 2 cm depth and alternate wetting and drying (AWD) at 3 & PLUSMN; 1 days interval for rice in sunken bed were tested. Rice yield was more (4.36 and 4.89 Mg ha(-1)) under CSW irrigation than AWD irrespective of raised bed width. The highest okra yield was noted by 14.09 and 15.43 Mg ha(-1) with AWD in 1:3 RSB systems, whereas the lowest yield was recorded in CSW 1:3 RSB systems. Rice equivalent yield (REY) was found as the maximum in AWD than CSW irrespective of raised and sunken bed configurations. The AWD in 3:3 RSB systems exhibited the highest WP of 1.02 and 1.01 kg m(-3) during the first and second year of study, respectively. Wider RSB system of land configuration ratio of 3:3 saved about 40-45% of irrigation water. Such information will help in the planning of an innovative intercropping system of summer rice + okra in the field by changing the land configuration to the raised bed and sunken bed with the AWD irrigation system."

This research from 2005 to 2014 aimed at analysing the effects of CA on longer-term productivity and profitability compared with conventional systems as practiced in two communities of Central Malawi. CA treatments outyielded conventional ridge tilled control plots in Mwansambo and Zidyana on average by between 22 and 31%, respectively. An economic analysis from 2011 to 2014 found that, on average, income was 50 and 83% greater in CA systems than in conventional systems. The crops were produced with 28 -39 less labour days ha(-1) compared with the conventional practice, leading to greater net benefits. Despite the higher returns with CA, there are still challenges with residue retention, weed control, adequate rotations, management of pests and diseases as well as other socio-economic constraints. At the same time, there are opportunities to address these challenges through site-specific and adaptive research using innovation systems approaches.

A review	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Review						"Mechanical weed control; Chemical weed control; Herbicides; Cultural weed control; Semi-arid agriculture; No-tillage"	"SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; ZEA-MAYS L.; AUSTRALIAN CROPPING REGIONS; REDUCED-TILLAGE SYSTEMS; LONG-TERM TILLAGE; COVER CROP; HERBICIDE-RESISTANCE; MANAGEMENT-SYSTEMS; SEMIARID ZIMBABWE; SOIL SOLARIZATION"	"Human-induced soil degradation has led to declining yields and soil fertility in many parts of the world. Conservation agriculture has been proposed as a strategy to ensure more sustainable land use. While conservation agriculture, based on minimum soil disturbance, crop residue retention, and diversification may improve a range of soil characteristics and can be a potential cropping system for improving farmer resilience to climate change, increased weed pressure is often an impediment to its widespread adoption in southern Africa. Weed control under conservation agriculture in other countries has been linked to increased herbicide use, but concerns about herbicide resistance, access to chemicals, and environmental impacts highlight the need for alternative weed control strategies accessible for smallholders. Farmers in semi-arid regions contend with the additional challenge of low biomass production, which may limit the weed-suppressing benefits of permanent soil cover. This paper reviews the regional applicability of various mechanical (manual weeding, weeding using animal traction, weed seed harvest), thermal (soil solarization, weed steaming, flaming), chemical (herbicides, seed coating), and cultural (crop competition, crop residue retention, intercropping, crop rotation) weed control strategies. For each strategy, benefits and challenges were assessed and contextualized with the circum stances of rainfed smallholder farmers in southern Africa. We found that (1) no single solution can solve all weed control challenges under current conservation agriculture systems; (2) success of weed control strategies is largely contingent upon site- specific conditions, including soil type, dominant weed species, and socioeconomic factors; and (3) practices new to southern Africa, such as weed steaming, merit localized research. Previous reviews have addressed various weed control strategies, but a comprehensive review of strategies available to smallholder farmers in semi- arid southern Africa is lacking. Finding a suitable combination of weed control strategies is critical for encouraging smallholder farmers to adopt and maintain conservation agriculture practices."

"SOYBEAN INTERCROPPING SYSTEMS; COWPEA INTERCROPS; YIELD; QUALITY; L.; GROWTH; MAIZE; CORN; PRODUCTIVITY; ARRANGEMENTS"	Harvesting time and type of accession of Forage legumes are important factors to determine their performance as companion crops for cereals. The objective of this multi-year field trial was to evaluate different harvesting times of forage cluster bean accessions sown as companion crops with forage sorghum under irrigated conditions. Treatments included two accessions (BR-90 and BR-99) and four harvesting times (pre-flowering, complete flowering, 50 and 100% pod formation). The BR-99 accession harvested at 100% pod formation had greater performance with respect to green forage yield (20.42 t.ha(-1)) and dry matter biomass (5.80 t.ha(-1)) and it was statistically at par within the same accession harvested at 50% pod formation. The highest quality forage with the maximum crude protein and ether extractable fat and lowest crude fiber was recorded by BR-99 harvested at 50% pod Formation, while BR-90 did not perform at par at all harvesting times. Harvesting of BR-99 at 100% pod formation also resulted in the highest net income along with the benefit-cost ratio. The harvesting of BR-99 at 50 and 100% pod formation resulted in non-significant differences of forage yields and economic returns, however, the quality of cluster bean Forage deteriorated at 100% pod formation thus harvesting at 50% pod formation would be preferred.

Particular attention was given to the phenological development of the plant and the plasticity of fruit growth in response to temperature, radiation, daylength, variety traits, and management. The model is characterized by a comparatively simple code and transparent algorithms, The model was parameterized for Chinese cotton varieties and validated with extensive independent datasets on cotton growth and production from the Yellow River region and Xinjiang Province, The model validation showed that the phenology, growth and yield were simulated satisfactorily. The root mean square error (RMSE) for date of emergence, date of flowering, date of open boll stage and duration from sowing to boll opening was less than four calendar days, both for cotton grown in monoculture and cotton grown in a relay intercropping system with wheat. The RMSE of predicted total dry matter compared with observations was at most 6.6%, of lint yield 6.6%, and for number of harvestable bolls 10.0%. SUCROS-Cotton provides a tool to (I) assess production opportunities of cotton in various ecological zones in response to temperature, incoming radiation and management, (2) identify optimal cotton ideotypes for different agro-ecological conditions and for guiding breeding efforts, and (3) explore resource-use-efficient cropping systems, including intercropping options, and crop management practices such as plastic film mulching and sowing date.

Crop residues (fodder/stover) are important feed resources for ruminants. This review was undertaken with the objective of improving understanding of the role of various crop management factors in affecting the productivity and quality of crop residues. Variability in productivity and quality of residues can be of both genetic and non-genetic origin. Recommended agronomic practices vary according to crop and cultivar and can release the maximum genetic potential determining quantity and quality of residues. Planting method and planting rate recommendations should be followed to maximise productivity. Although low density planting improved fodder quality, fodder yield declined. Time of sowing affected fodder yield in most of the crops, but fodder quality was not generally affected. It was common to observe that application of nitrogen (up to 120 kg ha(-1)) in cereals and application of phosphorus (up to 60 kg ha-1) in legumes improved the green and dry fodder yields, as well as crude protein (CP), crude fibre (CF) and other quality parameters. Inoculation of cereal seed with nitrogen fixing bacteria such as Azotobacter and seed of pulses with phosphate solubilising bacteria has been reported to decrease fertiliser needs and improve the CP and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) of fodder. Irrigating at more frequent intervals by splitting the same quantity of irrigation water into smaller irrigations and at critical stages improved dry matter and CP yields. Hand weeding resulted in better weed control efficiency and stover yield than application of herbicides. However, application of herbicides resulted in the greatest benefit:cost ratio. Manual harvesting resulted in lower losses than mechanical harvesting, and may affect quality depending on the extent of loss of different fodder components. Drought stress yielded more digestible organic matter due to increases in the proportion of leaves compared to stems. Saline conditions affected seed germination and crop yields. Several methods are suggested to counteract the effects of salinity. Intercropping of cereals with legumes improved fodder nutritional quality (mostly protein content). In almost all crops, a positive association was found between fodder and grain yield indicating simultaneous improvement in both characters. In most cases, fodder yield and digestibility were positively correlated and showed positive association with plant height, leaf number and the number of tillers per plant, but there were limits and variation among crops. The ICRISAT-ILRI partnership experiments were conducted with a diverse set of sorghum and pearl millet cultivars at ICRISAT, India. Planting density levels in both crops did not influence forage quality although some fodder yield traits were affected. A significant interaction of genotype with planting density was observed for grain and fodder yield in sorghumand grain yield and harvest index in pearl millet. Adherence to recommended crop management practices can potentially facilitate the release of the maximum genetic potential determining quality and yield parameters for improved animal production.

This study analyzed the efficiency of nitrogen fertilization ((NH4NO3)-N-15) applied after corn grain harvest to palisadegrass (Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu) in intercrops sown at two times, as well as the N residual effect on the subsequent corn crop. The field experiment was performed in Botucatu, Sao Paulo State, in southeastern Brazil, on a structured Alfisol- under no-tillage. The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design in a split plot scheme with four replications. The main plots consisted of two intercropping systems (corn and palisadegrass sown together and palisadegrass sown later, at corn top-dressing fertilization). The subplots consisted of four N rates (0, 30, 60, and 120 kg ha(-1) N). The subplots contained microplots, in which enriched ammonium nitrate ((NH4NO3)-N-15) was applied at the same rates. The time of intercrop sowing affected forage dry matter production, the amount of fertilizer-derived N in and the N use efficiency by the forage plants. Nitrogen applied in autumn to palisadegrass intercropped with corn, planted either at corn sowing or at N top-dressing fertilization, increased the forage yield up to a rate of 60 kg ha(-1). The amount of fertilizer-derived N by the forage plants and the fertilizer use efficiency by palisadegrass were highest 160 days after fertilization for both intercrop sowing times, regardless of N rates. Residual N did not affect the N nutrition of corn plants grown in succession to palisadegrass, but increased grain yield at rates of 60 and 120 kg ha(-1) N, when corn was grown on palisadegrass straw from the intercrop installed at corn fertilization (top-dressing). Our results indicated that the earlier intercropping allowed higher forage dry matter production. On the other hand, the later intercrop allowed a higher corn grain yield in succession to N-fertilized palisadegrass.

However, it still remains unclear about how the interspecific interactions of legume-cereal intercrops affect the BNF and N transfer to cereals as well as the crop yields when more plant species involved in intercropping system. To examine this issue we have established monocropping and intercropping systems with three legumes (Glycine max, Medicago sativa and Vigna radiata) and two cereals (Zea mays and Sorghum bicolor). An in situ N-15 labelling experiment was conducted to quantify the amount of N fixation by legumes and its N transfer to the intercropped neighbouring cereals. The biomass of legume-cereal intercrops varied with the specific coexisting plants. The biomass of Z. mays increased and S. bicolor decreased when intercropped with legumes, and the biomass of intercropped legumes decreased relative to monocropped ones. Interestingly, the percentage of fixed N transfer to cereals from legumes was negatively correlated with biomass of legumes (y =-2.539x+179.22, R-2 = 0.323, p = 0.017) and positively correlated with that of cereals (y = 3.532e(0.08)x, R-2 = 0.598, p < 0.001). Additionally, the fixed N by legumes was positively correlated with competitive response index of legumes (y = 0.899e(2.233x), R-2 = 0.533, p < 0.001), this confirmed that the facilitation of plant interactions significantly promoted the BNF of legumes. All these findings approved that the inclusion of legumes into cropping systems is a sustainable and intensive method to improve the biomass production of cereals and soil sustainability. Due to the specificity of species combinations in agriculture, intercropping G. max with Z. mays appears to be a promising cropping regime because G. max fixed more atmospheric N2 than the other two legumes, and Z. mays obtained more N when interplanted with G. max.

An investigation was carried Out on a sandy loam soil at Nsukka to determine the effects of no-till (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) each with bare fallow (B) and mulch cover (M) on soil physical properties under three cropping systems [sole sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L Moench), sole soybean (Glycine max L Merrill), and sorghum-soybean intercrop]. The layout was a split-plot in randomized complete block design, with the tillage systems as the main plots and the mulch practices as the sub-plots. The treatments [no-till and bare (NTB), no-till with mulch (NTM), conventional tillage and bare (CTB) and conventional tillage with mulch (CM)] were replicated four times. The selected key parameters evaluated after two years were density of earthworm casts, soil organic matter (SOM), bulk density (BD), total porosity (TP), pore size distribution (PSD), mean weight diameter (MWD), and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat). Earthworm activity was significantly (P <= 0.001) higher with NT under the intercrop system. Values were generally very low for SUM (1.06-1.48%), moderate for BD (1.34-1.51 Mg m(-3)) and TP (46-52%), and low to moderate for MWD (1.1-2.9 mm). The K-sat was within the slow to rapid range (8.1-57.0 cm h(-1)). Neither the tillage nor the mulch factors influenced SUM, BD, PSD, and MWD in the cropping systems. The TP was significantly (P <= 0.05) higher in the CT compared to the NT under the sole sorghum, where interaction showed higher value in the CTM compared to the rest. There was significant (P <= 0.05) enhancement of K-sat in the CT under the sole sorghum and the intercrop systems; whereas the value was significantly (P <= 0.01) higher in the bare fallow under the sole soybean. The cropping systems had more pronounced effect on the physical properties than the tillage-mulch management practices. All the measured parameters indicated significant (P <= 0.05) improvements under the sole soybean, except BD and MWD which were significantly (P <= 0.05) improved under the intercrop. Intercropping cereals and legumes on NT may be ideal for alleviating the soil's structural constraints. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."	"[Obalum, S. E.; Obi, M.

Diversity can be easily achieved by growing mixtures of cultivars with different resistance genes and homogeneous agronomic traits. The mechanisms by which disease is reduced in cultivar mixtures include the loss of inoculum due to the presence of resistant plants between susceptible ones and resistance induced by avirulent pathogens. The complementary effects of individual mixture components reacting to disease pressure and to abiotic stresses result in greater yield stability compared with pure stands. The quality of products from mixtures is at least equal to that obtained with pure stands. This type of resistance management is applicable to both annual and perennial crops.

The spatial spread of disease was simulated using a half-Cauchy distribution. The effects of five simulation variables on the effectiveness of cultivar mixtures in reducing disease development were investigated. These simulation variables were the sporulation rate, the median spore dispersal distance, the probabilities of cross-infection among hosts and pathogen races, the proportion of host plants that were completely susceptible (or, in the case of race-specific pathogens, the numbers of mixture components) and the spatial arrangement of the mixture components. Disease dynamics were summarized by the rate parameters of logistic equations and by the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) of incidence and severity. The potential reduction in disease development in cultivar mixtures, compared with pure cultures, was considerable. Mixtures were more effective in reducing race-specific pathogens than race-nonspecific pathogens. For both types of pathogen, most variation in logit-transformed mixture efficacy was due to the main effects of the simulation variables. For race-nonspecific pathogens, the performance of mixtures was influenced mainly by the proportion of plants that were susceptible and by the spatial arrangement of the two mixture components. For race-specific pathogens, the performance of mixtures was determined mainly by the number and the spatial arrangement of mixture components. The smaller the homogeneous genotype area, the greater the mixture efficacy. Higher sporulation rate decreased mixture efficacy. Planting the mixture components in square blocks was more effective in reducing disease than planting in strips. For race-nonspecific pathogens, increasing the proportion of susceptible plants decreased the mixture efficacy. For race-specific pathogens, disease in mixtures decreased with increasing numbers of mixture components. The effect on the mixture efficacy of increasing cross-infection probability from 0 to 0.25 was generally small. For the AUDPC-based efficacy of disease severity, the effects of median spore dispersal distance were also very large: the shorter the median spore dispersal distance, the less effective the mixture.

Nutritive value of corn silage in mixture with climbing beans	ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						"Crude protein; Neutral detergent fiber; In vitro true digestible dry matter; Neutral detergent fiber digestibility; Lactic acid"	"MAIZE; YIELD; PROTEOLYSIS; QUALITY; LEGUMES; CLOVER"	Corn (Zea mays L.) for silage is a major forage source for dairy cows in the northern USA. It has high-energy density, but crude protein concentration is low. This study was conducted to determine the silage fiber characteristics and fermentation profile of monoculture corn or in mixture with one of three climbing beans. The experiment was conducted in two locations in 2004 and 2005. Three climbing beans, velvet bean [Mucuna pruriens (L) D.C.], 'Rongai' lablab bean [Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet], and 'Scarlet Emperor' scarlet runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus L.) were intercropped with corn at two corn densities (82.5 and 55 thousand plants/ha). All three beans were sown at the same density (82.5 thousand plants/ha). Corn in monoculture or in mixture with bean was harvested between 1/2 and 3/4 milk line. Two 1-L glass jar mini-silos per treatment per replicate plot were filled at a density of 500 g/L, eight jars per treatment, and stored for a minimum of 45 days at room temperature (similar to 22 degrees C). At the time of ensiling a 500-g fresh sub-sample was also taken for dry matter and initial characterization of the corn and corn-bean mixtures. Each silo was analyzed for fiber characteristics, pH, and fermentation products. Silage crude protein (CP) concentration on average increased 12.6% in the mixture with the addition of any of the beans. but neutral detergent fiber (aNDF) concentration also increased 8.8%. The pH was 0.06 units greater in corn-bean mixtures than monoculture corn, and lactic acid concentration was on average 6.2% greater in the corn-bean mixtures than monoculture corn. The addition of climbing bean to corn increased CP but also had an effect on fiber concentration and fermentation profile. However, the nutritive value of corn-bean silage was similar to corn silage, indicating that corn-bean silage mixtures could be used in dairy cow rations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Productivity and Soil Water Availability in the Short Term	AGRICULTURE-BASEL			English	Article						"dryland cropping; mulching; finger millet; dry spells; yield; water use efficiency"	"DRY SPELLS; MAIZE; SYSTEMS; SORGHUM; YIELD"	Increasing within-season dry spells in Southern Africa in recent years have generated growing interest in conservation agriculture (CA) to secure crop yields, especially under rainfed systems. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of CA on finger millet's (Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn) growth, yield and water use efficiency on nutrient-depleted sandy soils. Five treatments, namely (conventional tillage (control), conventional tillage + mulch (partial CA1), reduced tillage only (partial CA2), reduced tillage + mulching (partial CA3) and reduced tillage + mulching + intercropping (full CA)) were evaluated over two consecutive cropping seasons (2015/16 and 2016/17) on-farm in the village of Chidora in Hwedza District, southeast Zimbabwe. All mulched treatments had 15-32% more soil water content over the two growing seasons compared to the control. The higher soil water content under the mulched treatments significantly improved finger millet growth and development during both seasons as evidenced by the lower number of days to emergence (3 days less), greater shoot biomass, higher number of productive tillers and higher number of fingers produced. The full CA treatment achieved the best finger millet grain yield of 1.07 and 1.29 t ha(-1) during the 2015/16 and 2016/17 seasons, respectively. Full CA, partial CA3 and partial CA1 increased finger millet grain yield by 70%, 14% and 17% during the 2015/16 cropping season compared to the control. During the 2016/17 cropping season, a similar trend in finger millet grain yield was observed. Full CA was also among the most efficient methods in terms of water utilization (WUE), especially during the 2015/16 season. We concluded that CA, particularly when practiced in full, was more effective at offsetting the water limitations imposed by intra-seasonal dry spells on finger millet and significantly improved productivity.

However, its production is constrained by some insect pests and diseases. As a prerequisite for the development of a more sustainable integrated insect pest and disease management strategy for cashew, information on the biology and ecology of the key insect pests and diseases in a changing environment, and on influencing biotic and abiotic factors, is needed. Surveys were conducted in the major cashew nut-producing areas of Tanzania for two seasons: August to December, 2009, and August to December, 2010. Data on number of infested and infected shoots by key insect pests and diseases, natural enemies and associated farmer practices, namely synthetic pesticide use and intercropping systems, were collected from different subzones within agroecological zones. Our data showed that abundance and diversity of key cashew insect pests and diseases were influenced by agroecological zones and subzones. Intercropping was more commonly practised in the northern than in the southern zone. Agrochemicals were most frequently used in the southern agroecological zone and affected the occurrence of natural enemies, notably the weaver ant that was more abundant in the northern zone. Furthermore, our findings revealed that Helopeltis sp. and the powdery mildew remained the major constraints to cashew nut production in Tanzania.	"[Agboton, B.

Although the beneficial effect of nitrogen (N) release from above-ground residues on banana nutrition is well known, little information is available on the N transfer from jackbean roots before and after the above-ground harvest. The aim of this study was to assess the relative contribution of exudates and root turnover in the N transfer from jackbean to banana in a greenhouse experiment. Nitrogen transfer was studied in a 6-month trial using the N-15 leaf feeding method, and estimated with a box model of N-15 dilution based on the observed data of N-15 content in exudates and decomposing roots. For the sowing-harvest period, the amount of N transferred from jackbean exudates represented 16% of banana N uptake and 0.7% of jackbean N uptake. Therefore, the N transfer flux via exudates was 23 times higher in terms of N input for the recipient plant than in terms of N output for the donor plant. This value, which is an index of the effectiveness of N transfer, was lower than those reported previously for other soil-plant systems in greenhouse conditions. This would be due to differences in root traits of the recipient plants. The amount of transferred N from root turnover after jackbean harvest represented 52% of banana N uptake in that period. The box model described N transfer from both legume N sources adequately (r(2) = 0.92). For the whole experiment, 38% of banana N uptake was derived from jackbean (6% from exudates and 32% from root turnover), and 62% from soil N. The results indicated that N transfer from root exudates of jackbean would be a useful but minor process compared with N release from root turnover in soil. The experimental and theoretical approach proposed in this study may be useful in screening studies to assess the capability of herbaceous legumes to transfer N.

However, crop function with respect to the stability of yield and quality in particular tends to be lost in this process. Diversity can be reintroduced into cropping systems as a trait not only to confer stability but also to exploit synergies between component genotypes, compensating for potential performance losses against the best performing genotype in any given season or location. Quality need not be compromised, and research has demonstrated practical development and deployment approaches, which challenge the assumed benefits of current approaches to agronomy and achieve enhanced crop function.

J	Gibson, AK				Gibson, Amanda Kyle			Genetic diversity and disease: The past, present, and future of an old idea	EVOLUTION			English	Article						"Crop disease; genetic diversity; genetic erosion; host heterogeneity; host-parasite interactions; infectious disease; intraspecific variation; monoculture effect; Red Queen; varietal mixtures"	"WHEAT CULTIVAR MIXTURES; F-SP HORDEI; MULTILINE CULTIVARS; ERYSIPHE-GRAMINIS; RESISTANCE GENE; WILD RELATIVES; MHC DIVERSITY; MIXED STANDS; EVOLUTIONARY SIGNIFICANCE; POPULATION-STRUCTURE"	Why do infectious diseases erupt in some host populations and not others? This question has spawned independent fields of research in evolution, ecology, public health, agriculture, and conservation. In the search for environmental and genetic factors that predict variation in parasitism, one hypothesis stands out for its generality and longevity: genetically homogeneous host populations are more likely to experience severe parasitism than genetically diverse populations. In this perspective piece, I draw on overlapping ideas from evolutionary biology, agriculture, and conservation to capture the far-reaching implications of the link between genetic diversity and disease. I first summarize the development of this hypothesis and the results of experimental tests. Given the convincing support for the protective effect of genetic diversity, I then address the following questions: (1) Where has this idea been put to use, in a basic and applied sense, and how can we better use genetic diversity to limit disease spread? (2) What new hypotheses does the established disease-diversity relationship compel us to test? I conclude that monitoring, preserving, and augmenting genetic diversity is one of our most promising evolutionarily informed strategies for buffering wild, domesticated, and human populations against future outbreaks.

We conducted this study to investigate the possibility of reducing fertilizer use by applying cereal-legume mixture planting in forage crops cultivation. A field experiment was conducted in 2017 and 2018 at Jintai farm in the northeast of the Tibetan plateau. The experiment was a randomized complete block design with four treatments: sole oat with nitrogen application rate of 120 kg ha(-1), sole oat with a lower nitrogen rate of 60 kg ha(-1), and oat and common vetch mixtures applied with those two nitrogen levels. Results showed that forage biomass production of oat-common vetch mixture was comparable or higher than that of corresponding sole oat under different nitrogen levels. Nitrogen uptake of the mixture was 19.6-81.7% higher than that of sole oat under high nitrogen fertilization and was 107.3-144.6% higher under low nitrogen. Biological nitrogen fixation of common vetch in mixture stands ranged from 11.1 to 59.1 kg ha(-1). Nitrogen use efficiency in the mixture was lower than that in sole oat under both nitrogen levels. However, the partial factor productivity of applied nitrogen (PFPN) in the mixture was higher than that in sole oat. Mixture with low nitrogen application attained the highest PFPN of 102.8 and 150.6 kg kg(-1) in 2017 and 2018 respectively. The mixture system depleted much more soil water storage than sole oat in both years. Water use efficiency based on biomass production in the sole and mixture systems were comparable. However, that based on crude protein production was far greater in the mixture system, and the advantage of the mixture under low nitrogen level was more significant compared to that under high nitrogen level. Therefore, we conclude that practicing cereal-legume mixture planting in forage production could improve nitrogen and water use efficiencies, maintain forage production and improve forage quality. We suggest applying the mixture planting system and reducing the amount of nitrogen application in forage production in the semi-arid farming area on the Tibetan Plateau and similar alpine regions worldwide.

However, little is known about the response of flavonoid production and release to co-cultivation with other crop species. This study investigated alterations in the concentration of flavonoids in plant tissues and root exudates in four legumes [alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), black medic (Medicago polymorpha L.), crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.), and subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.)] co-cultivated with durum wheat [ Triticum turgidum subsp. durum (Desf.) Husn.]. For this purpose, we carried out two experiments in a greenhouse, one with glass beads as growth media for root exudate extraction and one with soil as growth media for flavonoid detection in shoot and root biomass, using LC-MS/MS analysis. This study revealed that interspecific competition with wheat negatively affected legume growth and led to a significant reduction in shoot and root biomass compared with the same legume species grown in monoculture. In contrast, the concentration of flavonoids significantly increased both in legume biomass and in root exudates. Changes in flavonoid concentration involved daidzein, genistein, medicarpin, and formononetin, which have been found to be involved in legume nodulation and regulation of plant-plant interaction. We hypothesize that legumes responded to the co-cultivation with wheat by promoting nodulation and increasing exudation of allelopathic compounds, respectively, to compensate for the lack of nutrients caused by the presence of wheat in the cultivation system and to reduce the competitiveness of neighboring plants. Future studies should elucidate the bioactivity of flavonoid compounds in cereal-legume co-cultivation systems and their specific role in the nodulation process and inter-specific plant interactions such as potential effects on weeds.

There is a need to bridge the gap between the supply and demand of fodder through the adoption of specific sustainable fodder production strategies. The field experiments were conducted during kharif (rainy, June-October), rabi (post-rainy, October-February), and summer (March-May) seasons of 2018-19 and 2019-20 to identify a sustainable fodder cropping system module in randomized complete block design with fifteen fodder cropping systems in three replications. The main objective of this research was to identify the most productive cereal-legume cropping system, both in terms of quantity and quality of biomass, to reduce the gap between supply and demand of quality livestock feed around the year. Among cropping systems, Bajra-Napier hybrid intercropped with lucerne, cowpea, and sesbania recorded significantly higher green fodder (163.6, 155.2, and 144.0 t/ha/year, respectively) and dry matter yields (32.1, 30.8, and 31.3 t/ha/year, respectively). Similarly, the same perennial systems also recorded higher quality yield and ash content. However, higher crude protein content was noticed in monocrop legumes, with the highest in sesbania (22.32%), while higher ether extractable fat was found in monocrop sesbania (3.78%). The monocrop oats recorded higher non-fiber carbohydrates (36.90%) while a monocrop of pearl millet recorded higher total carbohydrates (80.75%), however they were on par with other monocrop cereal cropping systems. Cultivation of legumes as a monocrop, and their inclusion as an intercrop with cereals resulted in lower fiber fractions and improved crude protein in intercropping systems. Furthermore, this improved the dry matter intake and digestibility of fodder. With higher sustainable yield index values and land-use efficiency, perennial intercropping systems were also found to be sustainable. Thus, cultivation of the Bajra-Napier hybrid with either lucerne, cowpea, or sesbania as an intercrop will help livestock farmers to achieve higher productivity in terms of quantity and quality, and forms a viable option for overcoming livestock feed scarcity.

A 2-yr field experiment was conducted to compare genotypic differences in yield and quality of forage and grain for both SU and DU production. Barley genotypes differed significantly in forage yield for both SU and DU, among which six-row genotypes were superior to two-row genotypes especially in SU production. Wansipi 14008 had the greatest forage yield with the averaged fresh weights of 3.3 and 1.01 kg m(-2) for SU and DU, respectively, across 2 yr. Greater differences for forage crude protein (CP) content were found among genotypes for SU than those for DU, suggesting a more effective selection of barley varieties to improve CP content for SU production. The contents of crude fiber (CF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) differed among genotypes for both SU and DU, which were affected by the environmental conditions as well. Grain yield from DU treatment showed less variation than grain quality and agronomic traits. The high forage yield variety Wansipi 14008 could be recommended to farmers as a desired barley variety for both SU and DU production in south-central China.

Treatments consisted of eight cropping systems: S75C25 (75% sorghum + 25% clover), S50C50 and S25C75, as replacement series; S100C50, S50C100, and S100C100 as additive series; and sole cultures of sorghum and clover. The highest and lowest dry matter (DM) yield (29.17 and 10.71 Mg.ha(-1)) were found in the S100C100 and clover monoculture systems, respectively. Although the highest content of crude protein (CP) and digestible dry matter (DDM) were recorded from clover monoculture, the maximum yield of CP and DDM were obtained from the S100C100. Increasing the proportion of clover in intercropping decreased the acid detergent fiber and neutral detergent fiber, increased the relative feed value, net energy for lactation and dry matter intake. Increasing the proportion of sorghum in intercropping improved the yield of DM, CP and DDM. The land equivalent ratio for DM yield was higher than one in all intercropping treatments but were significantly higher in the additive intercropping systems. Overall, it could be concluded that sorghum and clover additive intercropping systems increased forage yield and quality, however if simultaneous increase of the quantity and quality of forage is the interest of this study then the S100C100 system had a significant advantage over other treatments and can be a suitable alternative for sorghum and clover monoculture systems in semi-arid regions."

Interest in intercropping for sustainable agriculture is on the rise and the number of scientific studies on intercropping is strongly increasing. Here we assess the current status of knowledge on factors that determine yield, yield stability and resource use efficiency of intercropping as compared to sole cropping. Distinguishing resource use into acquisition and conversion shows that intercrops are mainly improving acquisition rather than conversion efficiency. We also make an attempt to quantify the importance of reduced biotic stresses through pests, diseases, and weeds. We particularly focus on blank spots in the knowledge and possible bias in existing literature and ask which research approaches are needed to advance the field and pave the way for a wider usage of intercropping in modern sustainable agriculture.

Rhizobacteria that has ability to inhibit growth of weed called as deleterious rhizobacteria (DRB). The study aimed to get indigenous rhizobacterial isolates from weed rhizosphere of soybean that has potential as bioherbicide and can control the weed growth. The research was conducted in Agronomy Laboratory, Faculty of Agriculture, Halu Oleo University. The research consisted of four steps as follows: (1) Isolation of rhizobacterial from weed rhizosphere of soybean, (2) Evaluation of rhizobacterial ability as bioherbicide, (3) Rhizobacterial treatment on weed seed and (4) Observation of weed seed germination. Data were analyzed using two-ways analysis of variances (ANOVA) and Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS). The research found 45 indigenous rhizobacterial isolates, based on the differential morphological character from nine kinds of dominant weeds in soybean cropland. The results showed that some indigenous rhizobacterial isolates has potential as bioherbicide and suppress the viability and seed vigor of Paspalumconjugatum and Ageratum conyzoides. The most effective indigenous rhizobacterial isolate to a control of weed is Pk02 isolated from the rhizosphere of P. conjugatum and A08 isolated from the rhizosphere of A. conyzoides.

The experiment was designed based on split plots in a randomized block design with four replicates. Three different cutting times of pure sowing and mixtures were determined as booting, flowering and milk dough stages. Vetches were at 10% flowering when cereals were in booting stage, the vetches were in full flowering while the cereals were in flowering stage, while the lower pod-setting of vetches, the cereals were in milking dough stage. The pure sowing vetch was also harvested during these periods. The highest wet and dry hay yields, considering the mixture and cutting time separately, were obtained at the milk dough stage from the mixture of 25% HV + 75% T. The crude protein ratio increased with the increase in HV ratio of mixtures while the ratios of ADF and NDF decreased. The extend of cutting time from booting to milk dough stage increased the hay yield while quality traits were decreased. The superior yield and quality traits of annual legume + cereal mixtures, when evaluated along with cutting time, suggested that harvesting of 50% HV+50% T mixture can be recommended during flowering period.

A pot experiment completed in 2010-2012 analysed the relationship between spring wheat and the undersown Persian clover in the competition for nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and magnesium depending on the plant density during the spring wheat growth stages of inflorescence emergence (BBCH 54-56) and ripening (BBCH 87-89). A mixture was composed according to the additive pattern. The analyses covered the aerial parts and roots of both species. The species were cultivated in a mixture and pure sowing at higher density (consistent with agricultural technology recommendations) and a density 20% lower than recommended. Based on the measurements of dry mass of the aerial organs and roots, as well as the content of N, P, K and Mg in the plant parts, the uptake of these elements by both species was calculated. The above data were the basis for computing the relative yield (uptake) - RY, relative yield total (uptake) RYT, index of competitive balance (Cb) and relative efficiency index (REI). It has been shown that spring wheat and Persian clover competed for the whole pool of nitrogen and potassium and almost the entire content of phosphorus and magnesium. Wheat was a stronger competitor in obtaining the nutrients than clover. It showed the strongest competition against undersown clover for magnesium and the weakest one for nitrogen. Wheat competed more intensively with Persian clover for phosphorus and potassium in the treatment where the density was lower than recommended during the inflorescence emergence stage and for nitrogen and magnesium during the ripening stage.

The experiment was planned in a randomized complete block design, where a split-plot arrangement of mixture ratios was considered as the main plot with the row spacings considered as subplots. According to the mean of 2 years, the different mixture ratios and row spacings had a statistically significant effect on all of the properties. At the end of the research, among the different mixture ratios and row spacing interactions, the highest green herbage yield (33.4 t ha(-1)), hay yield (7.5 t ha(-1)), lowest neutral detergent fiber (52.2%), and crude ash (7.8%) rates were obtained from the 60%HV+40%AR mixture and 30-cm row spacing interaction. The highest crude protein (CP) rate (17%), CP yield (1156 kg ha(-1)) and ADF (39.5%) ratios were obtained from the 80%HV+20%AR mixture and 30-cm row spacing interaction. The highest RFV value (107) was obtained from the 80%HV+20%AR mixture and 20-cm row spacing interaction. These results show that increasing the HV ratio in the mixture has positive effects on the yield and quality, whereas raising the row spacing has adverse effects on the forage values. Therefore, 80%HV+20%AR or 60%HV+40%AR with a 30-cm row spacing interaction can be suggested for forage production in an HV and AR intercropping system."

(spring vetch) and Linum usitatisimum L. (linseed) are studied by means of a mathematical model describing the plant interactions. The model introduces parameters enabling to distinguish competition and cooperation between the species in the crop. The model parameters are established on the basis of the entire vegetation period of plants, so they provide exhaustive characteristics of the plant interactions in the mixtures. The model factors allow the estimation of the mixtures with respect to the final biomass yield as well. The experimental data verify possible economic benefits from the proposed plant mixtures and allow to critically check the beliefs that legumes improve the field productivity. Additionally, for comparison with the biomass yield, the seed yield is analyzed in the respective crops. Especially, it is indicated that the increased biomass yield for linseed in the mixture with a leguminous plant is accompanied with a decrease of the seed yield for this species. As concerns pea in the mixture with linseed, a decrease in the pea biomass was registered when compared to the sole crop but at the same time an increase in the seed yield was achieved in the mixture. No influence on the biomass of the spring vetch was noticed when it was cultivated with linseed but its seed yield appeared to be diminished with respect to the sole crop. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, the underlying mechanism is unknown. In this study, we used aqueous leachates and volatiles from Chinese chive to evaluate their antimicrobial activity on Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense race 4 (FOC), the causal agent of Panama disease in banana, and identified the antifungal compounds. Both leaf and root leachates of Chinese chive displayed strong inhibition against FOC, but the concentrated leachates showed lower inhibition than the original leachates. In a sealed system volatiles emitted from the leaves and roots of Chinese chive inhibited mycelial growth of FOC. Volatile compounds emitted from the intact growing roots mimicking natural environment inhibited spore germination of FOC. We identified five volatiles including 2-methyl-2-pentenal and four organosulfur compounds (dimethyl trisulfide, dimethyl disulfide, dipropyl disulfide, and dipropyl trisulfide) from the leaves and roots of Chinese chive. All these compounds exhibited inhibitory effects on FOC, but 2-methyl-2-pentenal and dimethyl trisulfide showed stronger inhibition than the other three compounds. 2-Methyl-2-pentenal at 50-100 mu l/l completely inhibited the mycelial growth of FOC. Our results demonstrate that antifungal volatiles released from Chinese chive help control Panama disease in banana. We conclude that intercropping and rotating banana with Chinese chive can control Panama disease and increase cropland biodiversity.

However, in African and Asian countries, where intercropping is widespread, the system can be looked on at a much larger scale: small fields alternate as strips with different crops grown on them, turning the collection of fields into a kind of unplanned intercropping. The more fragmented the agricultural landscape, the more relevant the borders can become. Traditionally, statistical analysis of intercropping experiments has been done by a simple analysis of variance without taking spatial models into account. But especially strip intercropping experimental arrangements lack in randomization as the cropping system imposes alternating strips. Thus, spatial variability and its effect on yield have to be regarded differently. Two different features of intercropping experiments were studied in the present paper: statistical peculiarities of intercropping designs and the border effect which is a key component of intercropping performance. Field trial results from Germany and China indicated that intercropping showed significant border row effects within the first four rows. For statistical analysis, different spatial models were added to the baseline model to account for the spatial trend and to check whether or not standard models are suitable for analyzing intercropping experiments. The results showed that for the German experiment the baseline model fitted well in the year 2008 and a common analysis of variance seemed to be well suited. However, for the Chinese experiments and the German experiment in the year 2009 the spatial models improved the model fit.

Although considered highly productive by Tibetans, farm incomes in the region are low, leading to a range of government initiatives to boost grain and fodder production. However, there is limited information available on current farming practices, yields, and likely yield constraints. The present paper uses available data and farmer interviews to describe the agro-climate and current systems of crop and livestock production, and considers possible strategies to boost production. Although winters in Tibet are cold and dry, summer and autumn provide ideal conditions for crop growth. Cropping systems are characterised by heavy tillage, frequent irrigation, high seeding rates and fertiliser applications, some use of herbicides, and little stubble retention or mechanisation. Spring barley and winter wheat are the predominant crops, followed by rapeseed, winter barley, and minor fodder and vegetable crops. Average yields for the main grain crops are around 4.0 t/ha for spring barley and 4.5 t/ha for winter wheat, significantly lower than should be possible in the environment. Farmers typically keep five or six cattle tethered near the household. Cattle are fed diets based on crop residues but are generally malnourished and rarely produce beyond the needs of the family. It is suggested that research and extension in the areas of crop nutrition, weed control, irrigation, seeding technology, and crop varieties should enable significant increases in grain yield. Increases in cattle production will require increases in the supply of good quality fodder. Cereal/fodder intercrops or double crops sown using no-till seed drills might enable the production of useful amounts of fodder in many areas without jeopardising food grain supply, and allow more crop residues to be retained in fields for improved soil health.

GRASS AND FORAGE SCIENCE			English	Review							"CENTRAL ALBERTA; ANNUAL RYEGRASS; SEEDING RATES; NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION; CROPPING SYSTEMS; RESOURCE USE; BARLEY-PEA; YIELD; MIXTURES; CORN"	Cereals grown for forage are increasing in importance in the rations of ruminants in the UK and have the potential to supply high proportions of energy-rich forage in their diets. However, such diets usually require some degree of protein supplementation. Crop mixtures, generally referred to as intercrops, have the potential to boost the forage protein content of diets as well as having a number of agronomic benefits. In this paper, the growth and utilization of annual intercrops is reviewed with particular reference, where feasible, to temperate regions. General agronomic and feeding issues associated with cereal intercrops are outlined together with the practicalities of field-scale management of intercrops in highly mechanized systems. A number of cereal-based intercrop combinations are also considered, concentrating specifically on their value for forage production. The future potential for different combinations is discussed and research recommendations made.

Treatments at each site consisted of (i) two 4-yr rotations, each with the same crop sequence but different tillage methods, and (ii) four continuous barley treatments in 2 x 2 factorial combination of tillage and fertilizer N, The crop sequence was barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)-barley and field pea (Pisum sativum L.) intercrop-barley-fababean (Vicia faba L.). At Ellerslie, tillage for weed control and seedbed preparation was either CT-LI or ZT. At Breton, one rotation used the LI approach; the second used deep tillage (DT). Weeds on CT and ZT were controlled with either pre- or postemergence herbicides. No herbicides were applied to LI treatments at either site or to the DT treatment at Breton, Yields of barley following legumes under ZT were similar to those of fertilized continuous barley. With nonchemical weed-control methods, weed competition reduced yields of barley following legumes by 24% compared with fertilized continuous barley, The increased fababean yield measured under DT was associated with improved rooting conditions and water extraction. The equivalent N-fertilizer value of legume residues with similar weed-control levels averaged 19 kg ha(-1), Except for the LI system, legume-based rotations produced, over the 4-yr cycle, amounts of N equivalent to continuous cereal systems. Resource use efficiency of legume-based rotations, as measured by net-N yields, was equivalent to continuous systems at Breton, but somewhat reduced at Ellerslie."

We used quantile regression to estimate the effect of temporal niche differentiation and its interaction with other key characteristics of intercropping, i.e., crop type combination, N fertilizer, relative density, and intercropping pattern, using data from the intercropping literature. Quantile regression characterizes the entire distribution of the response metric by estimating quantiles of this distribution. This method gives a comprehensive characterization of the diversity of the response in the population. In this study, the effect of temporal niche differentiation on the LER was positive and significant across all quantiles (10, 15, ..., 85, 90%). The response of the LER to temporal niche differentiation was similar in C-3-C-3 and C-3-C-4 intercrops except at low quantiles (below 20%), where a stronger response was found in C-3-C-4 than in C-3-C-3 intercrops. There was a negative effect of N fertilizer on the LER in the absence of temporal niche differentiation at all tested quantiles. At low LER (quantiles <20%), this negative effect was alleviated by increasing temporal niche differentiation due to a positive interaction between N fertilizer and temporal niche differentiation. The results indicate that temporal niche differentiation has a robust positive effect on the LER across a wide range of LERs, but the strength of this effect is influenced by intercrop characteristics, especially at low to median LER values. Case-specific experiments are therefore indispensable for identifying advantageous species mixtures and optimal management adapted to local conditions.

Therefore, this study aimed to identify determinants of farmer adaptation strategies with their costs and benefits of each adaptation strategy. The data were collected from 155 farm households using a random sampling method through semistructured questionnaires. The result of the multivariate probit model revealed that the likelihood of farmers to adopt adjustment of planting date, changing crop varieties, intercropping, crop rotation, irrigation, and minimum tillage were 51.6%, 61.9%, 56.1%, 38.1%, 10.3%, and 27.1%, respectively. The joint likelihood of using all adaptation strategies was 4.2%, while their failure to adopt all the adaptation strategies was 9.8%. Among the given adaptation options, intercropping, adjusting planting dates, crop rotation, and changing crop varieties are economically viable climate adaptation strategies. Regarding the intensity of adaptation, 78% of sampled respondents were used more than one adaptation option, and their NPV and BCR were higher when they used at least one adaptation option. Farmers who did not adopt any adaptation options were able to receive the lowest income per unit production. The study recommends that households should use multiple combinations of adaptation practices rather than the use of a single adaptation option. Thus, the government and stakeholders must provide educational and extension service, training, and updated climate information to smallholder crop producers to use and select the best and combination of adaptation strategies.

From genes to individuals to communities, compensatory processes ensure functionality, stability and resilience. While there is a rich literature on compensation in natural and semi-natural communities, as well as for crop monocultures, quantification of compensation in the context of diversified agro-ecosystems, such as binary crop mixtures, has remained underdeveloped. We elaborate a method of quantifying compensation which is consistent across systems of only one component (monocultures) and two component-systems (mixtures). Using plant communities and their response to loss of plant density as an example, we apply this concept to a published data set on experimentally grown monocultures and mixtures of beans and oats. Against loss of plant density, oat and bean monocultures compensated 46 % and 33 % of grain yield, respectively. Compensation in the mixture was small (9%) when compensating loss of bean density, but larger (42 %) when bean density was fixed, compensating against loss of oat density. Remarkably, in the case of fixed bean density, the mixtures did not show a higher degree of compensation than the oats monoculture (i.e. where bean density is fixed at zero seeds). Further, we generalize this approach by characterizing four variables, the Contributor (which suffers the loss that needs to be compensated; e.g. plant density), the Reductor (which leads to a reduction in the Contributor; e.g. a mortality factor reducing plant density), the Outcome (which is the variable of interest that directly depends on the Contributor; e.g. grain mass per unit area), and the Compensator (which represents the variable responsible for the compensation, e.g. the grain mass per remaining plant) and summarize this as the 'CROC' model of compensation. We provide a framework for quantitative research on compensation in intercropping and other contexts, and its relationship to resilience and stability. The analysis of compensation in mixtures can help to develop the potential of diversification for improving multifunctional performance of agro-ecosystems, especially in response to biotic and abiotic stresses."

(oilseed rape) was grown with daikon and white lupin in a polyvinyl chloride split pot experiment (with no barrier between the compartments or by a nylon mesh barrier (37 mu m) to license partial root interaction, or a solid barrier to stop any root interactions) to examine the effect of rhizosphere interaction on the cadmium uptake. The results showed that shoot and root biomasses of oilseed rape were 40.66% and 26.94% less than that of the monocropped treatment (solid barrier) when intercropping with daikon under the rhizosphere complete interaction. However, the intermingling of roots between oilseed rape and white lupin notably enhanced the dry biomass of oilseed rape by 40.23% and decreased with the reduction of root contact. Oilseed rape intercropping with daikon enhanced the shoot Cd concentration of oilseed rape. The shoot Cd concentration (44.8 mg/kg) of oilseed rape when intercropped white lupin under complete rhizosphere interaction were greater than those of other treatments. Additionally, the intermingling of mots played a positive role in the content of citric and malic acids when intercmpping with white lupin. In all systems, the BCF values of oilseed rape >5. Therefore, intercropping with white lupin may contribute to higher biomass and increased uptake Cd by oilseed rape. We can toward sustainable positive effects on phytoremediation that based on a better understanding of rhizosphere processes.

However, both phosphate fertilization and the solubility of phosphorus (P) sources may affect this contribution. This study aimed to evaluate the response of Guinea grass (Panicum maximum) intercropped with legumes and fertilized with phosphate fertilizers of different solubility. Guinea grass was grown as a single crop, fertilized or not with mineral N, and intercropped with Java (Macrotyloma axillare), or dwarf pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan); phosphorus was applied as triple superphosphate (P-TSP) or Bayovar (P-Bay), plus a control without phosphorus. The highest forage yield and N accumulation was observed in Guinea grass fertilized with N and P, with 70,364 and 60,036 kg ha(-1)of dry matter, resulting in 977 and 1004 kg ha(-1)of N accumulated by the plants for P-TSP and P-Bay, respectively. The introduction of legumes increased the N accumulation but decreased yield of Guinea grass. The highest nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) was found with P fertilization, i.e., 56% and 54% for P-TSP and P-Bay, respectively. The use of legumes intercropped with Guinea does not improve the effectiveness of the reactive rock phosphate. Therefore, the introduction of legumes intercropping with Guinea grass may be an alternative to N fertilization only when P is not applied to low fertile soils. Broadcast and incorporated P fertilization by the time of Guinea grass sowing, not only increases forage yields but also results in higher NUE regardless of P fertilizer solubility."

Impact of Diverse Annual Forage Mixtures on Weed Control in a Semiarid Environment	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Article						"weed suppression; multi-species forage mixtures; polyculture; row spacing; intercropping"	"SUPPRESSION; PEA; PRODUCTIVITY; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; GROWTH; YIELD"	Intercropping with different crop species and different spatial patterns is suggested to lead to increased competition with weeds and reduced weed abundance and biomass. In this study, our objective was to explore the ability of multi-species annual forage crop mixtures to control weeds while providing productive forage. We utilized field and greenhouse trials to evaluate the impact of different crop mixtures and row spacing on weed control in the semi-arid Brown soil region of southwestern Saskatchewan, Canada. Seven different mixtures of up to eight annual forage crops were grown with row spacing of 15 or 30 cm in a replicated field trial. Weed abundance and biomass were significantly affected by crop species mixtures. Crop mixtures that contained radish and barley generally had higher weed suppression. Row spacing did not significantly impact weed abundance or biomass across the treatments. Results were similar over both years in spite of drastically different precipitation conditions. Forage production was significantly different between cropping mixtures in July in both years. The barley-radish mixture had the highest crop biomass in July, and this early crop production was linked to weed suppression because crop biomass had a significant effect on weed abundance and biomass in July, but not August. A greenhouse experiment was used to further evaluate the crops (i.e., barley and radish) that demonstrated the highest weed suppressive activity in the field trial. Crop identity and row spacing were both significant factors affecting weed and crop biomass production. Radish exhibited stronger control of common lamb's quarters (Chenopodium album) compared to barley, but the binary mixture of the two species produced the highest crop biomass and equivalent weed control compared to the radish monoculture. This research suggests that cropping with multiple species (particularly forage radish) may be an effective way to control weeds in semiarid environments.

This study evaluated weed infestation and seed yield of the lentil varieties 'Tina' and 'Anita', as well as of a mixture of these two varieties, sole cropped and row intercropped with naked oats as a supporting crop. Additionally, lentil was sown at a different row spacing of 20 and 25 cm. The lentil variety 'Anita' produced 25.3% higher yields than var. 'Tina'. Weight of 1000 seed, number of pods per plant, and first pod height did not differ significantly in the treatments with the lentil varieties. The lentil seed yield obtained in the treatments with a supporting crop was lower by 9.4% compared with the sole cropped plots. In turn, the 1000 seed weight was 3.9% higher in the treatment where a supporting crop was used. The presence of oats as a supporting crop in lentil crop allowed crop competitiveness against weeds to be increased significantly, thus reducing their total number and dry weight by 5.3% and 30.5%, respectively. Sowing lentil at different row spacings did not have a significant effect on seed yield and weed infestation in crop. The greatest diversity of weed species was found in the treatments where the mixture of the lentil varieties was sown and in the treatment with the smaller row spacing. Intercropping of lentil with oats resulted in reduced occurrence of monocotyledonous weeds such as Echinochloa crus-galli and Elymus repens. The presence of oat as a supporting crop can effectively reduce the pressure from weeds without significantly reducing lentil cultivar yield in organic farming.

Genotypic differences in red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) response under severe water deficit	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						"Cover crop; Drought; Inter-seeding; Red clover; Trifolium pratense; Winter wheat"	"SOIL STRUCTURAL STABILITY; WINTER HARDINESS; HORDEUM-VULGARE; DROUGHT STRESS; FALL DORMANCY; COVER CROPS; CORN GROWTH; ALFALFA; YIELD; WHEAT"	Aims In Ontario, Canada, acreage of red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) intercropped with winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em. Thell) has declined, despite well-documented soil and yield benefits. The decline has resulted from increasing prevalence of stand non-uniformity, which has been attributed in part to soil moisture deficits. We examined whether there are genotypic differences in drought response between red clover varieties. Methods A double-cut (Belle) and a single-cut variety (Altaswede) were grown under four different durations of drought (4, 8, 12 and 16 days below 15% relative soil water content, RSWC). Shoot dry weight, shoot relative water content (RWC), leaf area and crown water content were measured in control, drought and drought + recovery treatments. Results Belle used significantly more water during soil moisture deficit and had greater leaf area, shoot dry weight and RWC compared to Altaswede. In contrast, Altaswede had significantly higher survival rates than Belle, attributed to maintenance of meristematic tissue viability in the crown where re-growth, after shoot tissue desiccation, can occur. Conclusions By demonstrating genotypic variation in survival strategies of red clover, traits can be identified for the development of improved varieties. Varieties with higher survival rates during drought will result in more uniform stands and increased utilization of red clover for environmental and yield benefits.	"[Loucks, Cora E.

The growth regulator mepiquat chloride (MC) is used worldwide to restrict vegetative growth and promote boll formation and yield. The effects of MC are modulated by complex interactions with growing conditions (nutrients, weather) and plant population density, and as a result the effects on plant form are not fully understood and are difficult to predict. The use of MC is thus hard to optimize. Methods To explore crop responses to plant density and MC, a functional-structural plant model (FSPM) for cotton (named CottonXL) was designed. The model was calibrated using 1 year's field data, and validated by using two additional years of detailed experimental data on the effects of MC and plant density in stands of pure cotton and in intercrops of cotton with wheat. CottonXL simulates development of leaf and fruits (square, flower and boll), plant height and branching. Crop development is driven by thermal time, population density, MC application, and topping of the main stem and branches. Key Results Validation of the model showed good correspondence between simulated and observed values for leaf area index with an overall root-mean-square error of 0.50 m(2) m(-2), and with an overall prediction error of less than 10% for number of bolls, plant height, number of fruit branches and number of phytomers. Canopy structure became more compact with the decrease of leaf area index and internode length due to the application of MC. Moreover, MC did not have a substantial effect on boll density but increased lint yield at higher densities.

Treatments were composed of two types of legumes (mung bean, soybean), two planting patterns (alternate single rows, alternate double rows), and two times of seeding (simultaneous, staggered) together with three monocrop treatments of sweet sorghum, mung bean, and soybean in randomized complete block design. Key observations indicated that the average yields of soluble sugars and starch were significantly reduced in intercropping systems in both seasons, due to partial or interactive influence of treatments considered. Yields of soluble sugars and starch were increased by 6 and 11% in the dry season and by 5 and 19% in the wet season in sweet sorghum-soybean and sweet sorghum-mung bean associations, respectively, when established with staggered seeding compared to those in simultaneously seeded combination or in monocropping of sweet sorghum.

Effect of a Living Mulch on Weed Seed Banks in Tomato	WEED TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						"Alternative weed management; critical period; intercrop; mowing"	"SUMMER ANNUAL WEEDS; COVER CROPS; CIRSIUM-ARVENSE; MANAGEMENT; BUCKWHEAT; INTERFERENCE; SUPPRESSION; STRATEGIES; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS"	Weeds that emerge between rows in fresh market tomatoes after the critical period of competition are not suppressed by the crop and can produce large quantities of seed. A living mulch planted between rows might limit weed seed production. Buckwheat was seeded between tomato rows after the critical period in 2007 and 2008 in field studies near Lafayette, IN. Weeds were allowed to emerge after the critical period (CP), controlled throughout the growing season (no seed threshold [NST]), or mowed to limit seed production (MOW). Buckwheat and MOW plots were mowed twice after the critical period in 2007 and once in 2008. Seed banks were sampled after the critical period and in the following spring. Tomato yields were not reduced by growing buckwheat between rows. Seed bank densities for common purslane and carpetweed, which escaped mowing due to their prostrate habits, increased in all treatments. Germinable seed bank densities were 306 seeds m(-2) or less in the NST and buckwheat treatments but 755 seeds m(-2) or more in the CP treatments for species with erect habits in both years. Seed bank densities were lower in the MOW treatment than in the CP treatments in 2007 but not in 2008. In a parallel experiment conducted in adjacent plots, buckwheat was seeded at five rates (0, 56, 112, 168, and 224 kg seed ha(-1)). Plots were mowed and emergent weeds sampled as described for the intercrop experiment. Weed densities before mowing decreased linearly with buckwheat seed rate. After mowing, no relationship was detected between seed rate and weed densities. This study supports the hypothesis that a living mulch planted after the critical period can be used to limit seed bank growth without reducing tomato yields, but additional research is needed to better understand the effect of mowing on living mulch growth and weed suppression.

EFFECT OF CROPPING SYSTEM COMPLEXITY ON PLANT-PARASITIC NEMATODES ASSOCIATED WITH ORGANICALLY GROWN VEGETABLES IN FLORIDA	NEMATROPICA			English	Article						"Broccoli; bell pepper; cover crops; crop rotation; Helicotylenchus; intercropping; living mulches; Meloidogyne; Mesocriconema; Paratrichodorus; Pratylenchus; sweet corn; yellow squash"	"TROPICAL ROTATION CROPS; ROOT-LESION NEMATODES; PEARL-MILLET; POPULATION-DENSITIES; PRATYLENCHUS-PENETRANS; MELOIDOGYNE-INCOGNITA; COVER CROPS; YIELDS; MANAGEMENT; ARENARIA"	Two field experiments were initiated in summer 2006 in north-central Florida to compare the effects of integrating cover crops, living mulches, and intercropping on plant-parasitic nematode populations, as well as the effect of fall and spring vegetables on the multiplication rate of root-knot nematodes. Treatments consisted of seven organic cropping systems that included a summer cover crop followed by fall and spring vegetables. The summer cover crop included: pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), sorghum sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor x S. bicolor var. sudanense), sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea), velvetbean (Mucuna pruriens var. pruriens), weedy fallow, mixture of pearl millet-sunn hemp, and mixture of sorghum sudangrass-velvet bean. One experiment utilized fall yellow squash (Cucurbita pepo) and spring bell pepper (Capsicum annuum) as vegetable crops, and fall broccoli (Brassica oleracea) and spring sweet corn (Zea mays) were used in the other experiment. Nematode populations were monitored at the end of the cover crop and vegetable seasons. Summer cover crops of sorghum-sudangrass or pearl millet increased root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) population levels in some instances while sunn hemp suppressed it in the broccoli-sweet corn experiment. The multiplication rate of root-knot nematodes was lowest when broccoli was planted in the cropping system. Systems with sorghum-sudangrass (alone or in mixture) increased population densities of ring (Mesocriconema spp.) and lesion (Pratylenchus spp.) nematodes, and occasionally increased stubby-root nematodes (Paratrichodorus spp.). Cover crops that increased nematode numbers when planted alone usually gave the same result when planted in mixtures with another cover crop. Other cropping systems failed to suppress plant-parasitic nematodes but maintained low densities similar to weedy fallow.	"[Bhan, M.; Chase, C.

However, the successful use of interseeded cover crops has been limited by their tendency to either inadequately suppress weeds or suppress both weeds and the crop. We hypothesized that in irrigated broccoli production, winter rye could suppress annual weeds through rapid emergence and shading, without adversely affecting the taller transplanted broccoli crop. In field experiments conducted in New York from 1999-2001, broccoli was cultivated at 0, 10, or 10 and 20 d after broccoli transplanting (DAT), with or without rye at the final cultivation. Rye interseeded at 0 DAT suppressed weeds and improved yields relative to unweeded controls but resulted in broccoli yield losses relative to weed-free controls in 2 of 3 years. Rye seeded at either 10 or 20 DAT did not reduce broccoli yields but had little effect on weeds for a given level of cultivation and resulted in Powell amaranth seed production of up to 28,000 seeds m(-2). Rye interseeded at 0 DAT reduced light availability to weeds in 2000 but not in 2001 when Powell amaranth avoided shading from rye through rapid emergence and vertical growth. In greenhouse pot experiments, low temperatures for 7 d after seeding delayed the emergence of Powell amaranth by 3 d relative to rye and increased the suppression of Powell amaranth by rye from 61 to 85%. Our results suggest that winter rye may be more successfully integrated into broccoli production (1) when sown at higher densities, (2) in locations or seasons (e.g., spring) with lower initial temperatures, and (3) in combination with other weed management tools.

On-station trials were conducted at Minjibir near Kano during the 1994 and 1995 rainy seasons to determine the components of the water balance and compare water use (WU) and water productivity of millet planted sole (SM) at the recommended optimum densities and intercropped at farmers' planting densities under two levels of soil fertility. Infiltration rates were generally high, with an overall mean in the porous sandy soil of 17 cm h(-1). Deep drainage losses accounted for 15% of annual rainfall in a low rainfall season (1995) and an estimated more than 20% in the wet 1994 season. Additional top dress NPK fertilizers (OM + IF) to cereals prior to the commencement of reproductive stages, increased soil water extraction in the intercrops in the drier year, for which soil water status was, therefore, higher in plots where only organic manure (OM) was applied. The relatively higher annual rainfall in 1994 generally increased soil water use. Later maturity of sorghum in the M-S-C intercrop increased WU of this cropping system, particularly in 1995. SM produced significantly (P < 0.01 in 1994 and P < 0.05 in 1995) higher total dry matter (TDM) than the intercrops, a trend shown over the complete growing season most of the time, with the exception of OM SM in 1995. The total grain yield was significantly (P < 0.01) higher in SM in the wet 1994 season. Millet, particularly when intercropped, used water more efficiently for grain production in 1995 along with other limiting resources. It showed better adaptation to moisture stress by producing similar (P = 0.79) harvest indices (HIs) in sole and intercropped millet. HIs of the sole cereals and the OM M-C were relatively higher in the 1995 than in the wet 1994 season. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Crop residues and green manures require proper management in order to maximize their contribution to nutrient supply and SOM maintenance. The objectives of this study were to quantify the rates of C and N mineralization from cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Waip.) green manure, cowpea residue, and millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R.Br.) residue under field conditions in Niger and to determine the effect of these organic amendments on pearl miller yield. Miller was grown (1) as sole crop, (2) as intercrop with cowpea, (3) as intercrop with cowpea that was incorporated as green manure during the second half of the growing season, (4) with incorporated cowpea residue (2000 kg ha(-1)), (5) with millet residue mulch (3000 kg ha(-1)), and (6) with N fertilizer. Carbon loss as CO2 from soil with and without organic amendment was measured three times per week during the growing season. Nitrogen fertilizer increased miller yield only in a year with a favorable rainfall distribution. Cowpea grown in intercrop with miller during the first part of the sowing season and subsequently incorporated as green manure between miller rows increased miller grain yield in a year with sufficient early rainfall, which could be attributed to the rapid rate of decomposition and nutrient release during the first 3 weeks after incorporation. In a year with limited early rainfall, however, densely planted green manure cowpeas competed for water and nutrients with the growing miller crop. Incorporated cowpea residue and miller residue mulch increased miller yield. Surface applied miller residue had high rates of decomposition only during the first 3 days after a rainfall event, with 34% of the miller residue C lost as CO2 in one rainy season. Recovery of undecomposed millet residue at the end of the rainy season was related to presence or absence of termites, but not to seasonal C loss. Miller residue mulch increased soil organic C content of this sandy Alfisol in Niger. Cowpea and millet residues had a greater effect on SOM and miller yield than cowpea green manure due to their greater rate of application and slower rate of decomposition.

Traditional nematode management is based on the use of crop rotations, resistant cultivars, nematicides, or combinations of these methods. For a crop like peanut (Arachis hypogaea), cultivars resistant to root-knot nematodes are not available. There are soybean (Glycine max) cultivars resistant to some of the species of root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.); however, most fields have nematode infestations composed of mixtures of species. Research at Auburn has shown that tropical crops can be used effectively in rotation to manage nematode problems. Rotations with American jointvetch (Aeschynomene americana), castor (Ricinus communis), hairy indigo (Indigofera hirsuta), partridge pea (Cassia fasciculata), sesame (Sesamum indicum), and velvetbean (Mucuna deeringiana) have resulted in good nematode control and increased yields of peanut and soybean. Some crops (castor, sesame) are considered 'active' in that they produce compounds that are nematicidal, whereas others (e.g. corn, sorghum) are simply non-host, that is, 'passive'."

These bacteria can act to promote plant growth in various plant species, including corn (Zea mays L.). However, there is a need to understand the behavior of these bacteria in different agricultural systems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect on the growth and yield of corn inoculated with A. brasilense, and to identify the type of farming system which benefited most from the use of A. brasilense-based inoculants. The experiment conducted over two corn crop seasons was arranged in a 6 x 2 factorial scheme, consisting of six farming systems and the presence or absence of inoculation with the bacteria A. brasilense. The farming systems were derived from a long-term experiment with different fertilization systems that has been conducted since 1984. Among these systems, there were three conventional systems (CNT1: conventional no-till without fertilizer; CNT2: amventional no-till with 150 kg ha(-1) of mineral fertilizer + 50 kg ha(-1) of urea; CNT3: conventional no-till with 300 kg ha -1 of mineral fertilizer + 100 kg ha(-1) of urea), and three organic systems (ONT1: organic no-till with 40 m(3) ha(-1) of organic compost; ONT2: organic no-till with 20 m 3 ha(-1) of organic compost; ONT3: organic no-till with 40 m 3 ha(-1) of organic compost and intercropped with Canavalia ensiformis). Although the Azospirillum population in the soil before planting was the same for all six systems, the count in the rhizospheric soil was higher in the organic systems, and there was no increase in that count due to inoculation. In this study, the only difference observed was within the CNT1 system, between the inoculated (CNT1-I) and uninoculated (CNT1-NI) treatments. In this system., inoculation resulted in an increase in plant height, in addition to higher concentrations of foliar N and P, and a higher plant survival rate, which culminated in higher yield. Corn inoculated with A. brasilense in the CNT1-1 treatment showed a significant increase in yield-2839 kg ha(-1) higher than that recorded for CNT1-NI. This study shows that, in the conventional low input treatment CNT1-I, inoculation with A. brasilense resulted in an increase in corn growth and yield."

Each trial involved three woody hedgerow legumes with cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) as the sole intercrop. The hedgerow trees at the base of the slope showed greater survival and higher leaf dry weights than those at the top of the slope, although these parameters were not affected by VAM inoculation, either at the top or the base of the slope. In contrast to survival, the uptake of nutrients, particularly P and N, was higher for inoculated than uninoculated hedgerow trees, both at the top and at the base of slope. Increases in stem and leaf biomass and the uptake of nutrients by the trees were strongly correlated with increases in P uptake, indicating that the improvements were attributable to VAM inoculation. Cassava tuber yields at the base of the slope, from inoculated or uninoculated plants, were significantly greater than the corresponding cassava yields at the top of the slope. These increases at the base of the slope compared to the top of the slope were not attributed to available soil nutrients but to greater VAM spore density. Higher available soil moisture may have been another factor. Increasing the VAM spore density of effective mycorrhiza through proper agronomic practices at the top of a slope may bring about comparable yields on different parts of the slope.

The experiment was conducted in two environments in 2005. 'Rongai' lablab bean and corn were intercropped at eight different planting densities; 20180, 40/0, 40/40, 40/80, 60/0, 60/40, 60/80, and 80/80 thousand corn/lablab bean plants/ha. Corn in monoculture or in mixture with bean was harvested between 1/2 and 3/4 milk line. Two I-L glass jar mini-silos per treatment per replicate plot were filled at a density of 500g/L, eight jars per treatment per location, and stored for 40 days at room temperature (similar to 22 degrees C). At the time of ensiling a 500-g fresh sub-sample was also taken for dry matter (DM) and initial characterization of the corn and corn-bean mixtures. Each silo was analyzed for fiber characteristics, pH, and fermentation products. Silage crude protein (CP) concentration was on average 17.5% (86.4 g/kg DM) greater in the mixture than monoculture corn(73.5 g/kg DM). The in vitro true digestible DM (IVTDDM) concentrations in the mixtures were on average 4.6% less (796 g/kg DM) than that of monoculture corn (834 g/kg DM), but neutral detergent fiber digestibility was not different between monoculture corn and corn-lablab mixtures (P>0.05). Lactate concentration was 21.2% higher in the corn-lablab bean mixtures (60.5 g/kg DM) than monoculture corn (49.9 g/kg DM). The contribution of the lablab bean to the mixture increased as corn planting density decreased. Thus the maximum benefits to increased CP occurred in the mixtures with the lowest corn planting densities, but those mixtures also had the greatest reductions in IVTDDM. However all treatments fermented well in spite of significant (P<0.05) differences in pH and fermentation products. Published by Elsevier B.V."

A meta-analysis across natural and agricultural systems	EVOLUTION LETTERS			English	Letter						"Crop disease; genetic diversity; host heterogeneity; host mixtures; host-parasite interactions; infectious disease; meta-analysis; monoculture effect"	"WHEAT CULTIVAR MIXTURES; FRESH-WATER SNAIL; FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT SELECTION; SPECIALIZED FUNGAL PATHOGENS; INTRASPECIFIC MIXED STANDS; STRIPE RUST; DISEASE RESISTANCE; PLANT COMPETITION; LATE BLIGHT; VARIETY MIXTURES"	If parasites transmit more readily between closely related hosts, then parasite burdens should decrease with increased genetic diversity of host populations. This important hypothesis is often accepted at face value-notorious epidemics of crop monocultures testify to the vulnerability of host populations that have been purged of diversity. Yet the relationship between genetic diversity and parasitism likely varies across contexts, differing between crop and noncrop hosts and between experimental and natural host populations. Here, we used a meta-analytic approach to ask if host diversity confers protection against parasites over the range of contexts in which it has been tested. We synthesized the results of 102 studies, comprising 2004 effect sizes representing a diversity of approaches and host-parasite systems. Our results validate a protective effect of genetic diversity, while revealing significant variation in its strength across biological and empirical contexts. In experimental host populations, genetic diversity reduces parasitism by similar to 20% for noncrop hosts and by similar to 50% for crop hosts. In contrast, observational studies of natural host populations show no consistent relationship between genetic diversity and parasitism, with both strong negative and positive correlations reported. This result supports the idea that, if parasites preferentially attack close relatives, the correlation of genetic diversity with parasitism could be positive or negative depending upon the potential for host populations to evolve in response to parasite selection. Taken together, these results reinforce genetic diversity as a priority for both conservation and agriculture and emphasize the challenges inherent to drawing comparisons between controlled experimental populations and dynamic natural populations.

Moench] with tropical perennial grasses and using the appropriate rate of sidedress N application can maximize grain yield (GY) and revenue and can improve land-use efficiency (LUE). The effects of monocropped sorghum (MS) or sorghum intercropped with palisadegrass (Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu; SPG) or guineagrass (Panicum maximum cv. Mombasa; SGG) and sidedress N application rates of 0, 50, 100, and 200 kg ha(-1) on leaf nutrient concentration, sorghum GY, revenue, and LUE were investigated during three growing seasons at Botucatu, SP, Brazil, on a clay, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Haplorthox. The SGG treatment had lower leaf N, P, and K concentrations and lower 1000-grain weight, shoot dry matter, and GY than MS and SPG at all sidedress N rates; MS and SPG at 200 kg ha-1 of sidedress N resulted in greater sorghum GYs (3.80 and 3.81 Mg ha-1, respectively). The forage dry matter production (FDMP) and crude protein of tropical perennial grasses were higher as a function of the sidedress N rate. The SGG treatment resulted in negative net profits for all sidedress N rates. The MS and SPG treatments (independent of sidedress N rates) resulted in similar net profits (approximately US$85 and 560 ha(-1), respectively). The SPG treatment using 200 kg ha-1 of sidedress N resulted in a higher land equivalent ratio and relative N yield (1.27 and 123%, respectively) than SGG (0.96 and 107%, respectively). The SPG treatment with 200 kg ha(-1) of sidedress N is the best option for increasing sorghum GY, revenue, and FDMP from autumn to part of the spring and for improving LUE."	"[Mateus, G.

Fungal plant pathogens observed on perennial cereal crops in New York during 2017-2018	RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS			English	"Article; Early Access"						"ACE-1; fungal pathogens; Kernza; perennial grains; plant disease; Secale cereale; Thinopyrum intermedium"	"FUSARIUM HEAD BLIGHT; COMMUNITY DATA; GRAIN; WHEAT; RESISTANCE; DISEASES; DISSIMILARITY; PERSPECTIVES; MANAGEMENT; TILLAGE"	"Perennial grain crops are emerging as a promising addition to sustainable agricultural systems because of their low-input requirements and delivery of ecosystem services. However, adoption of these crops is expected to bring novel management challenges, including those related to plant diseases. In New York, fungal pathogens of annual grains have a significant impact on crop yield and value and are generally controlled through a combination of host resistances, cultural practices and chemical fungicides. Without the availability of crop rotation and soil tillage practices, disease control in perennial grain systems may be problematic, and little is known about perennial grain crop susceptibility to local plant pathogen populations. During 2017 and 2018, ongoing field trials of two perennial grain crops recently introduced in New York, intermediate wheatgrass (IWG; Thinopyrum intermedium) and perennial cereal rye (PCR; Secale cereale), were assessed for the presence of putative fungal pathogens on actively growing plants, overwintered crop residue and harvested grain. A total of nine potential host-pathogen combinations were recorded based on symptomology, pathogen morphology and DNA sequences. Common annual crop pathogens were recovered most frequently, but, at one site, Phyllachora graminis, causal fungus of tar spot and a pathogen not previously reported on crops in New York, was found on IWG. Residue colonization by an important toxigenic pathogen (Fusarium graminearum) was high in both crops, though mycotoxin levels in associated grain were low, indicating either the hosts or environment were unsuitable for disease development. Seed-borne fungal communities differed across crops and locations, and black point, a condition caused by Alternaria and Bipolaris fungi and indicative of compromised grain quality, was prevalent in PCR under some conditions. Growing PCR with intercropped red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) resulted in less Stagonospora colonization of stem residue, and PCR grown with an oat (Avena sativa L.) nurse crop had a reduced incidence of black point. These alternative cultural practices may prove useful for managing disease in perennial grains. Our results suggest that the incorporation of perennial crops into the agricultural landscape will lead to familiar plant disease problems requiring new solutions as well as new problems that may require significant research investments."

A deficiency of P causes a severe impact on plant development and productivity. Several P-based fertilizers are being used in agriculture but limited uptake of P by the plant is still a challenge to be solved. Titanium (Ti) application increases the nutrient uptake by affecting the root growth; however, the role of Ti in plant biology, specifically its application under low light and phosphorus stress, has never been reported. Therefore, a pot study was planned with foliar application of Ti (in a different concentration ranging from 0 to 1,000 mg L-1) under different light and P concentrations. The result indicated that under shade and low P conditions the foliar application of Ti in different concentrations significantly improves the plant growth parameters such as root length, root surface area, root dry matter, and shoot dry matters. The increase was observed to be more than 100% in shade and low P stressed soybean root parameter with 500 mg L-1 of Ti treatment. Ti was observed to improve the plant growth both in high P and low P exposed plants, but the improvement was more obvious in Low P exposed plants. Auxin concentration in stressed and healthy plant roots was observed to be slightly increased with Ti application. Ti application was also observed to decrease rhizosphere soil pH and boosted the antioxidant enzymatic activities with an enhancement in photosynthetic efficiency of soybean plants under shade and P stress. With 500 mg L-1 of Ti treatment, the photosynthetic rate was observed to improve by 45% under shade and P stressed soybean plants. Thus, this work for the first time indicates a good potential of Ti application in the low light and P deficient agricultural fields for the purpose to improve plant growth and development parameters."

The extent of glycosylation was negatively related to the molecular weight of dextran. Thus, the SPI-dextran4 conjugate exhibited a darker color and a biggest decrease in whiteness from 70.49 to 45.51. SPI-dextran70 conjugate exhibited an increased surface hydrophobicity and free sulfhydryl content. Volume-average diameter of SPI-dextran70 conjugate-added soymilk and gel strength of the corresponding tofu ranged from 10.34 to 11.24 mu m and 0.068 to 0.083 N, respectively, which were lesser than those of the control (11.12 um and 0.133 N). However, SPI-dextran10 conjugate incubated for 6 days and SPI-dextran4 conjugate incubated for 2 days increased the gel strength of tofu to 0.146 and 0.143 N, respectively. Conjugates-added tofu exhibited an increased water holding capacity and a discontinuous and loose microstructure, but a lowered whiteness and a color change to yellow. Results demonstrated that the selection of dextran with an appropriate molecular weight and controlling the glycosylation degree were capable of improving the quality of SPI-dextran conjugate-added GDL-induced tofu.

However, including root characteristics as a criterion for cover crop selection requires more knowledge on their root growth dynamics. Seven cover crop species (crimson clover, winter rye, bristle oats, blue lupin, oil radish, winter turnip rape and phacelia) were grown in a two-year organically managed field experiment in Germany to screen them for root intensity and vertical root distribution. Root length density (RLD) and proportion of root length in large-sized biopores were determined before and after winter with the profile wall method. RLD and cumulative root length were analysed using a three-parameter logistic function, and a logistic dose-response function, respectively. Fibrous rooted winter rye and crimson clover showed high RLD in topsoil and had a shallow cumulative root distribution. Their RLD increased further during winter in topsoil and subsoil. The crops with the highest RLD in the subsoil were taprooted oil radish, winter turnip rape and phacelia. Bristle oat had intermediate features. Blue lupin had low RLD in topsoil and subsoil. Phacelia, oil radish, winter turnip rape and bristle oat showed the highest share of root length in biopores. These complementary root characteristics suggest that combining cover crops of different root types in intercropping may be used to enhance overall RLD for maximizing cover crop benefits.

Phytoremediation coupled with agro-production is considered a sustainable strategy for remediation of trace element contaminated fields without interrupting crop production. In this study hyperaccumulator Sedum alfredii was intercropped with a leguminous plant fava bean (Vicia fava) in cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) co contaminated field to evaluate the effects of intercropping on growth performance and accumulations of trace elements in plants with plant growth promoting endophyte (PGPE) consortium application. The results showed, compared with monoculture, intercropping coupled with inoculation application promoted biomass as well as Cd and Pb concentrations in individual parts of both plants, thus increasing the removal efficiencies of trace elements (4.49-folds for Cd and 5.41-folds for Pb). Meanwhile, this superposition biofortification measure maintained normal yield and nutrient content, and limited the concentration of Cd and Pb within the permissible limit (<0.2 mg kg(-1) FW) in fava bean during the grain production. These results demonstrated a feasible technical system for phytoremediation coupled with agro-production in slightly or moderately Cd and Pb co-contaminated field, and also provided useful information for further investigation of interaction mechanisms between intercropping and PGPEs inoculation.

However, two examples of environmental stresses that drastically regulate soybean growth are low light and high-temperature. Emerging evidence suggests a possible interconnection between these two environmental stimuli. Low light and high-temperature as individual factors have been reported to regulate plant hypocotyl elongation. However, their interactive signal effect on soybean growth and development remains largely unclear. Here, we report that gibberellins (GAs) and auxin are required for soybean hypocotyl elongation under low light and high-temperature interaction. Our analysis indicated that low light and high-temperature interaction enhanced the regulation of soybean hypocotyl elongation and that the endogenous GA(3), GA(7), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and indole-3-pyruvate (IPA) contents significantly increased. Again, analysis of the effect of exogenous phytohormones and biosynthesis inhibitors treatments showed that exogenous GA, IAA, and paclobutrazol (PAC), 2, 3, 5,-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) treatments significantly regulated soybean seedlings growth under low light and high-temperature interaction. Further qRT-PCR analysis showed that the expression level of GA biosynthesis pathway genes (GmGA3ox1, GmGA3ox2andGmGA3) and auxin biosynthesis pathway genes (GmYUCCA3,GmYUCCA5andGmYUCCA7) significantly increased under (i) low light and high-temperature interaction and (ii) exogenous GA and IAA treatments. Altogether, these observations support the hypothesis that gibberellins and auxin regulate soybean hypocotyl elongation under low light and high-temperature stress interaction.

In a two-year experiment, seven fertilization treatments were compared: green manuring of pure barley (B100) and pure vetch (V100) sown at 100% of their ordinary seeding rates, green manuring of a barley-vetch mixture at a ratio of 75:25 of their own seed rates (B75V25), fertigation with drip irrigation at a rate of 200 kg ha(-1)of nitrogen (N) (Fert_N200), fertigation combined with B100 and B75V25 at a N rate complementary to 200 kg N ha(-1)(B100 + Fert and B75V25 + Fert, respectively), and an unfertilized control (N0) with no cover crops for green manuring prior to tomato transplanting or fertigation. The Fert_N200 treatment resulted in maximum tomato N uptake, growth and yield, but caused high N leaching, especially during the no-cover fall-winter period, as was also the case for N0. The V100 treatment promoted quite good tomato N status and yield, but did not reduce N leaching. The B100 and B75V25 treatments reduced N leaching but decreased tomato N uptake, growth and yield. The B100 + Fert and B75V25 + Fert treatments reduced N leaching, likely increased soil N stock, and facilitated optimal tomato N nutrition and maximum yields. Combining fertigation with green manuring of cover crops composed of pure grass or grass-legume mixtures appears to be a very effective and environmentally sound practice for fertilizing high N-demanding spring-summer crops like processing tomato.

Intercropping systems with halophyte plants not only improve production efficiency but also reduce soil salinity. In this study, the effects of different levels of irrigation water salinity and intercropping system on physiological indices and biological yield of Kochia, Guar and Sesbania were investigated during the growing seasons of 2016 and 2017. A split plot experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The main factor was salinity of irrigation water (4, 9 and 14 dS m(-1)) and the sub-factor was different cropping systems that consisted of mono cropping of Guar, Sesbania or Kochia, intercropping of two species and intercropping of three species. Results showed that salt stress increased sodium in the leaves of Kochia, Guar and Sesbania. Compared to mono cropping of Guar, in intercropping of three species and in intercropping with Kochia, Guar leaf potassium content was increased by 33.3% and 19.9% respectively. Salinity levels of 9 and 14 dS m(-1)compared to salinity level of 4 dS m(-1)increased the soluble sugar content of Kochia plant by 65.7% and 52.7%, respectively. However, in similar salinity levels, the trend for soluble sugar changes in Guar was vice versa. Salinity treatment of 14 dS m(-1)decreased the relative water content of Sasbania and Guar leaves, but had a reverse effect on Kochia. Intercropping of two and three species also increased the relative water content of Sasbania and Guar leaves. Enhancement in salinity stress increased ionic leakage and malondialdehyde content of Guar leaf. On the other hand, at salinity level of 14 dS m(-1), intercropping of three species increased the carotenoid content and decreased the amount of Guar leaf malondialdehyde compared to the Guar mono cropping system. The results of this study showed that salinity stress had negative effect on Guar yield but intercropping with Kochia could partly improve the yield of both Guar and Sesbania. In addition Kochia showed relatively good yield potential under salinity stress. Therefore, to improve the production of Sesbian and Guar, and also physiological performance of Kochia, intercropping system of these plants is recommended under salinity stress conditions.

Here, we set up a field experiment to evaluate the advantages of cultivating Z anthoxylum bungeanum with Capsicum annum, and Z. bungeanum with Glycine max as intercrops, compared with cultivating Z. bungeanum in monoculture. Effects of extreme drought stress conditions on morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits of the three crop species cultivated in the three contrasting planting systems were compared. Results showed that extreme drought conditions induced negative impacts on Z. bungeanum grown in monoculture, due to reduced growth and metabolic impairment. However, limited stomatal conductance, reduced transpiration rate (T-r), and increased water use efficiency, carotenoid content, catalase activity, and accumulation of soluble sugars in Z. bungeanum indicated its adaptive strategies for tolerance of extreme drought stress conditions. Compared with cultivation in monoculture, intercropping with C. annum had positive effects on Z. bungeanum under extreme drought stress conditions, as a result of improved crown diameter, leaf relative water content (LRWC), net photosynthetic rate, and proline content, while intercropping with G. max under extreme drought stress conditions increased net CO2 assimilation rates, LRWC, T-r, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. In conclusion, Z. bungeanum has an effective defense mechanism for extreme drought stress tolerance. Intercropping with G. max enhanced this tolerance potential primarily through its physio-biochemical adjustments, rather than as a result of nitrogen fixation by G. max.

The first factor consisted of six cropping patterns including sole cropping of fennel, sole cropping of common bean, and different intercropping ratios of fennel to common bean (1:1, 2:2, 3:2, 4:2), whereas the second factor included the application and non-application of PGPR. The results showed that the highest seed yields of common bean (2474.83 kg ha(-1)) and fennel (2730.08 kg ha(-1)) were produced with sole cropping combined under PGPR application. The fennel essential oil (EO) and seed oil (fixed oil) content in all intercropping patterns were higher than those in sole cropping. Furthermore, under PGPR application, the seed yield, EO content, EO yield, fixed oil content and oil yield of fennel increased by 20.9, 16.4, 39.3, 10.3 and 33.3 %, respectively, compared with control. Based on the chemical analysis of fennel EO, the main constituents were (E)-anethole (73.71-81.10%), fenchone (3.44-6.18%), limonene (3.49-5.82%) and methyl chavicol (4.06-7.22%). The major fatty acids in fennel fixed oil were oleic (77.17-82.90%), linoleic (6.50-8.97%) and palmitic acids (3.25-6.80%). The highest content of unsaturated fatty acids (oleic and linoleic acids) and (E)anethole were obtained with intercropping ratios (fennel to common bean) of 2:2 and 3:2 under PGPR application, respectively. Furthermore, the highest land equivalent ratio (1.32) was obtained with intercropping ratio of 3:2 under PGPR application. Our findings showed that the intercropping ratio of 2:2 and 3:2 upon PGPR biofertilization may be suggested to farmers instead of sole cropping for enhancing the fennel EO and fixed oil quali-quantitative composition.

A 3-year study in the Central Anatolian Region of Turkey compared the persistence, productivity and nutritive value of sainfoin planted with nurse crops, namely Hungarian vetch (Vicia pannonica Crantz.) or triticale (x Triticosecale Wittm, ex A. Camus), at three seeding rates. Sainfoin and nurse crop emergence were significantly affected by the companion nurse crop, sowing rate and establishment year. The number of sainfoin plants at emergence was lower during a drier bad year (110 plant/m(2)) than in a good precipitation year (236 plant/m(2)). Triticale had a more negative impact on sainfoin growth than vetch. Planting nurse crops at high seeding rates (90 kg/ha) reduced the number of sainfoin seedlings as compared to the control, while the low seeding rate had little impact on sainfoin emergence. Planting sainfoin with triticale resulted in much greater yield exceeding 10 t/ha, but reduced the forage nutritive value compared to sainfoin monocultures and sainfoin-vetch mixtures. The seeding rate of the nurse crops during a dry year did not affect DM yield in the year of establishment nor in the following year. The findings of this study indicate that planting sainfoin with a nurse crop can substantially increase the DM yield in the year of establishment without yield penalties in the subsequent years, despite fewer established plants, as compared to sainfoin monocultures.

Little is known about the impact of growing winter rapeseed on ecological cropping systems and the associated economic benefits in the wind erosion area. To explore the winter rapeseed cover effect, we conducted a field experiment in which we covered the soil with winter rapeseed, winter wheat and wheat stubble at different plant density levels and used the spring bare ground as the control (CK). The effects of wind erosion, the winter rapeseed + multiple cropping system, and the economic benefits were compared. There was a large difference in the dry matter, the maximum water absorption, the maximum water storage, the soil evaporation and total wind erosion, the amount of sediment transported in the stratum and the wind erosion modulus. Among them, the mean wind erosion modulus of spring sowing bare land was as high as 490.9 kg.hm(-2).h(-1), which was 7 and 13 times that of winter wheat and winter rapeseed, respectively. As the wind speed increased from 14 to 22 m.s(-1), from a small density to a large density, the mean wind erosion modulus decreased from 68 to 17 kg.hm(-2).h(-1) for winter rapeseed, and 150 to 31 kg.hm(-2).h(-1) for winter wheat. Total wind-erosion of sediment transport of CK was 18.6 g.m(-2) min(-1), which was 16 and 31 times the mean value of winter wheat and winter rapeseed, respectively. Winter rapeseed + replanting peanuts, potatoes, rice, seed melons and other crops generally increased the production value by 5-74% compared with wheat and corn intercropping, which was 98-255% higher than the traditional wheat single crop. Our results suggested that the suitable area for planting winter rapeseed in northern China was approximately 3.3 x 10(6) hm(2), and in terms of the best economic and ecological effects, the appropriate density was 5 x 10(5) plants.hm(-2) in northern China. Our results indicated that Chinese winter rapeseed was the best choice for preventing wind erosion and improving ecological and economic benefits in winter and spring in northern China; additionally, winter rapeseed has important impacts on agricultural sustainability in semi-arid and arid climates."

An integrated arable management system was designed to maintain yields, whilst enhancing biodiversity and minimising environmental impact. Management interventions included conservation tillage and organic matter incorporation for soil biophysical health, reduced crop protection inputs and integrated pest management strategies for enhanced biodiversity and ecosystem functions, and intercropping, cover cropping and under-sowing to achieve more sustainable nutrient management. This system was compared directly with standard commercial practice in a split-field experimental design over a six-year crop rotation. The effect of the cropping treatment was assessed according to the responses of a suite of indicators, which were used to parameterise a qualitative multi-attribute model. Scenarios were run to test whether the integrated cropping system achieved greater levels of overall sustainability relative to standard commercial practice. Overall sustainability was rated high for both integrated and conventional management of bean, barley and wheat crops. Winter oilseed crops scored medium for both cropping systems and potatoes scored very low under standard management but achieved a medium level of sustainability with integrated management. In general, high scores for environmental sustainability in integrated cropping systems were offset by low scores for economic sustainability relative to standard commercial practice. This case study demonstrates the value of a 'whole cropping systems' approach using qualitative multi-attribute modelling for the assessment of existing cropping systems and for predicting the likely impact of new management interventions on arable sustainability.

Then, we investigated the morphological characteristics and stem carbohydrate accumulation of different soybean (Glycine max L.) genotypes under different light environments (normal light, low light and shading stress). Based upon metabolic accumulation of carbohydrates in the stem, we explored the reasons for the differences in stem strength of different soybean genotypes and expounded the relationship between accumulation and distribution of carbohydrates. Results of the present study showed that with the advancement of soybean growth period, the cellulose and lignin contents in soybean stem increased while the hemicellulose, sucrose and soluble sugars contents decreased. Compared with normal light conditions, the lignin, cellulose, soluble sugar and sucrose contents in the soybean plants under shading stress were reduced to different levels. Moreover, low light significantly reduced non-structural carbohydrate content in soybean stem while the lignin and cellulose contents were not significantly changed. The correlation analysis showed that there was a significant positive correlation among the stem snapping resistance, cellulose and lignin contents. The results showed that the stem strength was mainly determined by lignin and cellulose contents. The lignin content in the stem had a greater effect on the stem strength compared to cellulose. The xylose in soybean stem was also significantly reduced under the shading stress, which reduced lignin synthesis substrates. Under low light and shading stress, the minimum decrease in sucrose and structural carbohydrates content of a genotype (B23) was noticed indicating that B23 had high stem strength and increased decomposition of sucrose into cellulose synthesis. This trait of increased decomposition reduces the plant's inefficient decomposition of sucrose thus most of the sucrose is used to synthesize cellulose. Conclusively, these results suggested that deposition of a relatively large amount of structural carbohydrates (e.g. lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose and monosaccharides) leads to thicker stem tissues which could be helpful to reduce lodging due to shading stress under multiple cropping systems.

AND CLITORIA (CLITORIA TERNATE) GROWN IN AN ARID SALINE ENVIRONMENT	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES-JAPS			English	Article						"Arid saline soils; Forage productivity; Grass-legume mixture; Organic manures"	"STRESS; WHEAT"	A field experiment was conducted at Hada Al-Sham Research Station of King Abdulaziz University over two successive seasons (2015/17) to evaluate the effect of a cereal (Sudan grass) intercropped with a leguminous (Clitoria) forage under saline arid environment. The treatments, besides intercropping, included fermented poultry and cow manures applied separately and in combination. A split plot design with three replicates was used. Intercropping treatments were randomly assigned to main plots whereas the manure treatments were assigned to sub- plots. Results showed significant differences for both fermented poultry and cow manures when combined together compared to other treatments for both growth and yield parameters. Moreover, intercropping of Clitoria with Sudan grass significantly increased both fresh and dry forage yields compared to sole crop during both seasons. The increments in dry forage resulting from combined poultry and cow manures ranged from 53.7 to 118% in the first season and from 146 to 514% in the second season. On the other hand, the increments in dry forage resulting from intercropping ranged from 82.4 to 203% in the first season and from 58.7 to 237% in the second season. It can be concluded that fermented organic poultry and cow manures with intercropping of grasses and legumes can boost forage productivity under arid saline environment.

It utilized as food cook and processed into various foods. The soybean demanding continues to increase but the production capacity still low. One of limiting factors to increase soybean production is weed competition. The effective method to weed control usually is using chemical herbicide but had adversely effect on the environment and food health. The development new method in control weed was very interesting. The research was conducted in Agronomy Laboratory, Faculty of Agriculture Halu Oleo University, using randomized block design (RBD), consisting of 4 treatments. The treatments were P-0 = control, P-1 = Isolate Pseudomonas aeruginosa A08 + water, P-2 = Isolate Pseudomonas aeruginosa A08 + talc powder and P-3 = Isolate Pseudomonas aeruginosa A08 + chaff charcoal husk powder. Each treatment was repeated three times, and each experimental unit consisted of three plants so that there were 36 plants. The result showed that the P. aeruginosa could suppress weed growth but does not had adversely affect on the soybean growth. The best carrier material for bioherbicide formulation suitable for P. aeruginosa is the talc powder that can improve the ability of P. aeruginosa A08 as bioherbicide.

From 2014 to 2016, a large-scale study was conducted in Aksu, an important agricultural area in southern Xinjiang, to compare the abundance and species composition of spider mites in cotton fields under jujube-cotton, apple-cotton, and cotton monocrop systems. The abundance of spider mites in cotton fields under both intercropping systems was generally higher than in the cotton monocrop. The species composition of spider mites also differed greatly between cotton intercropped with apple or jujube compared to the cotton monocrop.The relative proportion of Tetranychus truncates Ehara (Acari:Tetranydiidae) in the species complex generally increased while that of another spider mite, Tetranychus dunhuangensis Wang (Acari:Tetranychidae), decreased under fruit tree-cotton systems. More attention should be paid to the monitoring and management of spider mites, especially T. truncates in this important region of China.

To explore this question, we created an investigation in which we collected data on the leaf area, leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf anatomy, cell size, cell number, gas exchange and soluble sugar content of leaves from three soybean varieties grown under full sunlight (NS), shaded mature leaves (MS) or whole plants grown in shade (WS). Our results show that MS or WS cause a marked decline both in leaf area and LMA in newly developing leaves. Leaf anatomy also showed characteristics of shade leaves with decreased leaf thickness, palisade tissue thickness, sponge tissue thickness, cell size and cell numbers. In addition, in the MS and WS treatments, newly developed leaves exhibited lower net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs) and transpiration rate (E), but higher carbon dioxide (CO (2) ) concentration in the intercellular space (Ci) than plants grown in full sunlight. Moreover, soluble sugar content was significantly decreased in newly developed leaves in MS and WS treatments. These results clearly indicate that (1) leaf area, leaf anatomical structure, and photosynthetic function of newly developing leaves are regulated by a systemic irradiance signal from mature leaves; (2) decreased cell size and cell number are the major cause of smaller and thinner leaves in shade; and (3) sugars could possibly act as candidate signal substances to regulate leaf area systemically."

However, there are at least two agronomic cases when it would be advantageous to distribute N fertiliser to legume crops: at sowing, before the onset of nodule functioning, and when a legume is intercropped with a cereal. We highlight the impact of various levels of fertiliser nitrogen on grain yield, nodulation capacity and biological nitrogen fixation in the four most common grain legume crops grown in central Italy. Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), field bean (Vicia faba L. var. minor), pea (Pisum sativum L.) and white lupin (Lupinus albus L.) were grown in soil inside growth boxes for two cropping seasons with five nitrogen fertilisation rates: 0, 40, 80, 120 and 160 kg ha(-1). In both years, experimental treatments (five crops and five levels of N) were arranged in a randomised block design. We found that unfertilised plants overall yielded grain, total biomass and nitrogen at a similar level to plants supplied with 80-120 kg ha(-1) of mineral nitrogen. However, above those N rates, the production of chickpea, pea and white lupin decreased, thus indicating that the high supply of N fertiliser decreased the level of N-2 fixed to such an extent that the full N-2-fixing potential might not be achieved. In all four grain legumes, the amount of N-2 fixed was positively related to nodule biomass, which was inversely related to the rate of the N fertiliser applied. The four grain legumes studied responded differently to N fertilisation: in white lupin and chickpea, the amount of nitrogen derived from N-2 fixation linearly decreased with increasing N supply as a result of a reduction in nodulation and N-2 fixed per unit mass of nodules. Conversely, in field bean and pea, the decrease in N-2 fixation was only due to a reduction in nodule biomass since nodule fixation activity increased with N supply. Our results suggest that the legume species and the N rate are critical factors in determining symbiotic N-2-fixation responses to N fertilisation.

Merr.] is a widely cultivated crop, whose growth and development are usually influenced by fluctuating light environment in fields. In the present study, two soybean cultivars (Nandou12 and Nan 032-4) were selected to study the regulatory mechanisms of capability to do photosynthetic work under different light intensities. Results showed that the net photosynthetic rate (P-n) of Nandou 12, which has a higher yield in field condition, was significantly higher than that of Nan 032-4 under all the light intensities studied. Measurements on stomatal conductance (G(s)) and intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i) suggested that the difference of P-n between these two cultivars was mainly caused by non-stomatal factors. Transcript detection found that the expression of genes encoding plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) and alternative oxidase (AOX), which represent the terminal oxidases of chlororespiration in chloroplasts and alternative respiration in mitochondria, respectively, was up-regulated in both cultivars when light intensity increased, implying potential roles of these two terminal oxidases in photosynthetic regulation. Further analysis showed that the expression level of PTOX increased more obviously in Nandou 12, together with higher non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and higher activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) than that in Nan 032-4, when light intensity increased. However, Nan 032-4 performed a more obvious up-regulation of AOX genes, as well as higher activities of NAD-malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and NADP-MDH than Nandou 12, when light intensity increased. These distinctions were consequently suggested to be potential reasons for the difference of photosynthetic performance between two soybean cultivars.

Nineteen trials were conducted during 2014 and 2015 in Mali and Niger for determination of: response functions for sorghum sole crop (SSC) and intercrop to N, P, and K; effects of the PxN interaction and of a nutrient package for diagnosis of other deficiencies; and a procedure for estimation of intercrop functions from SSC response functions. Six Niger on-station trials included treatments for determination of intercrop effects on sorghum yield and response. Mean grain and fodder yield increases for SSC were, respectively, 18.8 and 17.6% with 10 kg ha(-1) P, 30.7 and 18.8% with 30 kg ha(-1) N, and 0 and 6.8% with 10 kg ha(-1) K applied. The diagnostic treatment increased grain yield for only 1 of 19 site-years (SYs). Sorghum grain yield was 30% less with intercropping compared with SSC for 2 of 6 SY but 11% less overall. Overall, sorghum fodder yield was 23% more with intercropping. Sorghum response to P was 86% greater for SSC compared with intercrop. With intercropping, groundnut pod yield exceeded sorghum grain yield. The value of intercrop production was higher than for SSC. Fodder added 23 and 30% to the value of SSC and intercrop harvests, respectively. Equations were developed for determining optimal nutrient rates and intercrop response functions from SSC functions. Fertilizer applied to the intercrop compared with SSC has much more profit potential for this part of West Africa."	"[Maman, N.; Gonda, A.] INRAN, BP 240, Maradi, Niger; [Dicko, M.

Published research has demonstrated that auxin induces seed dormancy. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the effect of auxin on seed germination need further investigation, especially the relationship between auxins and both abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellins (GAs), the latter two phytohormones being the key regulators of seed germination. Here we report that exogenous auxin treatment represses soybean seed germination by enhancing ABA biosynthesis, while impairing GA biogenesis, and finally decreasing GA1/ABA and GA4/ABA ratios. Microscope observation showed that auxin treatment delayed rupture of the soybean seed coat and radicle protrusion. qPCR assay revealed that transcription of the genes involved in ABA biosynthetic pathway was up-regulated by application of auxin, while expression of genes involved in GA biosynthetic pathway was downregulated. Accordingly, further phytohormone quantification shows that auxin significantly increased ABA content, whereas the active GA1 and GA4 levels were decreased, resulting insignificant decreases in the ratiosGA1/ABA and GA4/ABA. Consistent with this, ABA biosynthesis inhibitor fluridone reversed the delayed-germination phenotype associated with auxin treatment, while paclobutrazol, a GA biosynthesis inhibitor, inhibited soybean seed germination. Altogether, exogenous auxin represses soybean seed germination by mediating ABA and GA biosynthesis.

Considering canopy architecture when planning cover crop mixtures	RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Article						"canopy architecture; fall growth; interspecies competition"	"PERFORMANCE; INTERCROPS"	Producers may be able to improve growth of cover crop mixtures by selecting species to occupy different levels (zones) in the cover crop canopy. This suggestion is based on a study where we compared four cover crop treatments, comprised of one, three, six and nine species, for biomass production. Oat, dry pea and oilseed radish were present in all multi-species mixtures. Treatments were established in August, following spring wheat harvest. Biomass was harvested 9 weeks later. The most productive treatment was the oat-dry pea-oilseed radish mixture. Species of this mixture occupied different zones in the canopy and minimized interspecies competition to improve production. Cover crop mixtures of six and nine species produced 24% less biomass, which we partially attribute to unequal distribution of species in zones of the canopy. This suggestion with canopy architecture could be tested further with other cover crop species to quantify its impact.

Additional correlation analysis and laboratory shading stress experiments with soybean seedlings also confirmed the function of these selected isoflavones, especially GE, in the discrimination of soybean seedlings with different levels of shade tolerance. Furthermore, the structure-antioxidant activity relationships between a range of isoflavones and the plant shade-tolerance mechanism are discussed. Targeted metabolomic analyses of isoflavones could reveal the diversity of shade tolerance in soybean seedlings, thus contributing to the breeding of excellent soybean varieties.

A more rapid and convenient method was established to identify and quantify twelve isoflavones and eight anthocyanins in BSSs by HPLC-MS analyses. The results indicated that beta-glucoside (G-type) and malonylglucoside (M-type) derivatives, cyanidin-3-glucoside (CYL) and peonidin-3-glucoside (PEO) are the major compounds found predominantly in the isoflavones and anthocyanins of BSSs. Combined with geographical data and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), it was demonstrated that higher isoflavone contents were found in the samples grown in the high-longitude areas of Guizhou and Chongqing, while higher anthocyanin contents were found in the samples grown in the high-latitude areas of Chongqing and Sichuan. Geographical location affected the accumulation of secondary metabolites involved in the phenylpropane pathway, especially in the trade-off/balance between isoflavone and anthocyanin biosynthesis in BSSs. Overall, a high-latitude environment has beneficial effects on the metabolism of the phenylpropane pathway, and a high-longitude environment can promote isoflavone biosynthesis, while a low-longitude environment is favorable for anthocyanin biosynthesis in BSSs.

The effects of intercropmulch (IM) of crown vetch (Coronilla varia L.) combined with different fertilizer treatments on WUE of apple trees and soil fertility of apple orchards were assessed over three years (2011, 2013 and 2014). A split-plot design was adopted, in which the main treatments were IM and no intercrop-mulch (NIM). Five sub-treatments were established: no fertilization (CK); nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer (NP); manure (M); N, P and potassium fertilizer (NPK); and NPK fertilizer combined with manure (NPKM). Due to mowing and mulching each month during July-September, the evapotranspiration for IM was 17.3% lower than that of NIM in the dry year of 2013. Additionally, the soil water storage of NPKM treatment was higher than that of CK during the experimental period. Thus, single fruit weight and fruit number per tree increased with IM and NPKM application. Moreover, applying NPKM with IM resulted in the highest yield (on average of three years), which was 73.25% and 130.51% greater than that of CK in IM and NIM, respectively. The WUE of NPKM combined with IM was also the highest in 2013 and 2014 (47.69 and 56.95% greater than applying IM alone). In addition, due to application of IM combined with NPKM, soil organic matter was increased by 25.8% compared with that of CK (in NIM). Additionally, application of IM combined with NPKM obtained more economic net return, compared to other combinations. Therefore, applying NPKM with IM is recommended for improving apple production in this rain-fed agricultural area."

Currently, numerous studies have focused on the model plant Arabidopsis in the KAR research field, rather than on crops. Thus the regulatory mechanisms underlying KAR regulation of crop seed germination are largely unknown. Here, we report that KAR delayed soybean seed germination through enhancing abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis, while impairing gibberellin (GA) biogenesis. Interestingly, KAR only retarded soybean seed germination under shaded conditions, rather than under dark and white light conditions, which differs from in Arabidopsis. Phytohormone quantification showed that KAR enhanced ABA biogenesis while impairing GA biosynthesis during the seed imbibition process, and subsequently, the ratio of active GA4 to ABA was significantly reduced. Further qRT-PCR analysis showed that the transcription pattern of genes involved in ABA and GA metabolic pathways are consistent with the hormonal measurements. Finally, fluridone, an ABA biogenesis inhibitor, remarkably rescued the delayed-germination phenotype of KAR-treatment; and paclobutrazol, a GA biosynthesis inhibitor, inhibited soybean seed germination. Taken together, these evidences suggest that KAR inhibit soybean seed germination by mediating the ratio between GA and ABA biogenesis."

Thus, two experiments were carried out with factorial arrangement based on randomized complete block design with three replications, to investigate the influence of AM fungi on common bean yield and essential oil (EO) quantity and quality of dill seed at different cropping systems in 2013 and 2014. The factors were cropping systems including (a) common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L) sole cropping (40 plants m(-2)), (b) dill (Anethum graveolens L) sole cropping at different densities (25,50 and 75 plants m(-2)) and (c) the additive intercropping of common bean + dill (25 + 40, 50 + 40 and 75+40 plants m(-2)). All these treatments were applied with or without AM colonization. In both cropping systems, the AM colonization significantly increased the seed and EO yields as compared with non-inoculated plants. The land equivalent ratio (LER), time equivalent ratio (ATER), land utilization efficiency (LUE) and relative value total (RVT) were higher at intercropping compared with sole cropping. The aggressivity (A) and relative crowding coefficient (K) values were greater for common bean than for dill, whereas the corresponding values for dill were lower in intercropping with common bean. In both years, the Funneliformis mosseae colonization improved yield and intercropping indices, compared with non-inoculated plants. The content of alpha-phellandrene, limonene, beta-phellandrene, dill-ether and carvone were enhanced in seed EO obtained from AM-inoculated and intercropped dill plants, while AM colonization resulted in a lesser content of alpha-phellandrene, limonene, beta-phellandrene, iso-dihydrocarveol and thymol in sole cropped dill plants.

Intercropping has the potential to improve rural livelihoods through better resource utilization and improved resilience to current and future challenges. This paper reviewed the concepts in intercropping and outlined how resources are captured and utilized within the system. Crop simulation models (CSMs) as decision support tools for intercrop/multicrop systems and future directions for modelling multicrop systems are the focus of the review. Through increased crop biodiversity, intercropping improves resilience, food security and nutrition. This is achieved through improved resource capture and utilization due to differences in spatial and temporal distribution of component crops. For farmers to maximize on these advantages, they need to have a thorough knowledge of species combination, arrangements and proportions. A major drawback to intercrop systems is that most of the existing agronomic recommendations are tailored on monoculture practices. This is also evident in the structure of most CSMs that cannot account for heterogeneous crop stands. In conclusion, there is a need to enhance agricultural research on intercrop systems, combining conventional and modern research approaches. Moreover, CSMs should be multidimensional in order to simulate system diversity accurately.

The objective of this research was to select herbicides applied postemergence to control white clover in soybean and know the effects of this control on soybean yield. Seven herbicides were assessed, applied postemergence, with or without sequential application of glyphosate, and two control treatments (no control and total control of white clover). Glyphosate (with two sequential applications), fomesafen (with a sequential application of glyphosate), chlorimuron-ethyl and lactofen have shown a satisfactory control of white clover (above 80%). The lower control efficiency has resulted in lower production of soybeans.	"[Schuster, M. Z.; Pelissari, A.; Szymczak, L.

However, developing effective programs to control weeds with herbicides that are safe to both crops can be challenging. Research was conducted to (1) identify herbicide systems to manage Palmer amaranth in cantaloupe-cotton intercropping production while minimizing crop injury, and (2) determine the profitability of cantaloupe-cotton intercropping. Ethalfluralin applied preplant did not injure cantaloupe or cotton, but Palmer amaranth was not controlled. The addition of fomesafen preplant improved Palmer amaranth control to at least 92% without injuring cotton, but cantaloupe necrosis and chlorosis of up to 20% was recorded. Halosulfuron-methyl was safely applied over cantaloupe, but its residual activity reduced cotton growth by 12% at 4 wk after planting; halosulfuron-methyl did not improve Palmer amaranth control beyond that noted with ethalfluralin plus fomesafen preplant. Intercropping systems that controlled Palmer amaranth at least 92% produced cantaloupe yields (25,760 to 25,890 fruit ha(-1)) similar to the weed-free monoculture system (24,120 fruit ha(-1)) but produced lint cotton yields that were 170 to 275 kg ha(-1) less than the weed-free monoculture cotton system. Although cotton production was less in the intercropping system, the returns over variable costs with intercropping systems ($ 21,670 to 21,920 ha(-1)) exceeded those of cantaloupe monoculture ($ 18,070 ha(-1)) or cotton monoculture ($ 1,890 to $ 1,955 ha(-1)), as long as Palmer amaranth was controlled. Intercropping cantaloupe and cotton is an effective approach to share land resources and production inputs as well as to improve grower profitability and is being rapidly adopted by Georgia growers."

Intercropping is an agricultural practice that aims to accrue the benefits of species diversity by growing two or more species simultaneously in the same space. Functional group diversity is considered important for enhancing the beneficial effects of species diversity, but most previous intercropping studies used combinations of only two functional groups. Thus, we used three green manure species from different functional groups: sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.), a C4 grass; crotalaria (Crotalaria juncea L.), a legume; and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), a forb. We examined the effects of intercropping on biomass, nutrient uptake, and their stability using a proportional replacement series in a field experiment for three years with four trials. The aboveground biomass was higher with dual and triple-component intercrops compared with sole crops; however, there were no superior effects of triple-component intercropping over dual-component intercropping.

The experiment was established in 2001, in the Planalto Medio region, RS, Brazil, in a Rhodic Hapludox (Oxisol), with annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) intercropped with black oat (Avena strigosa), under continuous grazing, during the winter, and single cropped soybean (Glycine max) during the summer. The treatments consisted of different grazing intensities, determined by sward height (10, 20, 30, and 40 cm), and a no-grazing area was used as a control. Soil bulk density and soil porosity were evaluated at the end of the grazing and soybean cycles, as well as soil resistance to mechanic penetration and aggregate stability in the seventh year of the experiment. No significant differences were found on soil bulk density and soil porosity after seven years under crop-livestock integration. Soil resistance to penetration is higher on the superficial layer after the grazing cycle. Soil aggregation increases in grazing areas, regardless of grazing intensities.

Winter Cereal Canopy Effect on Cereal and Interseeded Legume Productivity	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							"WHEAT TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; RED-CLOVER; COVER CROPS; NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION; YIELD COMPONENTS; GRAIN-YIELD; GROWTH; CORN; SOIL; ESTABLISHMENT"	Interseeding red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) or alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) into winter cereals in the North Central United States can provide forage and a green manure crop. We hypothesized that winter cereal canopy traits such as leaf area index (LAI) and whole plant dry matter (DM) would influence interseeded legume establishment and productivity, yet the effect of canopy traits on resource competition in intercropping systems is not well understood. This study was conducted from 2005 to 2007 to evaluate the impact of diverse cereal canopy traits on the establishment of frost-seeded legume intercrops. In March, red clover and alfalfa were frost-seeded into three winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and three triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack) varieties selected for differences in maximum LAI, plant height, and DM. Across three growing seasons, the cereals produced a range of LAI from 2.1 to 6.2 and whole plant harvest DM of 817 to 2029 g m(-2). In the 2 yr with legume data, densities were influenced by cereal 1 yr and DM was affected by cereal both years. Alfalfa and red clover densities were similar, yet DM production was 42% higher in red clover 40 d after grain harvest. The presence of a legume intercrop did not affect grain yield, but reduced weed densities and weed DM 40 d aft er harvest. Producers implementing this intercrop may select cereal varieties based on grain yield, but must be cautious of varieties known to produce above normal LAI values because of the potential to reduce legume productivity.

INTRODUCING AUTUMN SUGARCANE AS A RELAY INTERCROP IN SKIPPED ROW PLANTED RICE-POTATO CROPPING SYSTEM FOR ENHANCED PRODUCTIVITY AND PROFITABILITY IN THE INDIAN SUB-TROPICS	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article							"GROWTH; WHEAT; SOIL"	"Field experiments were conducted for the three consecutive cropping seasons of 2003-05, 2004-06 and 2005-07 at the Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research, Lucknow, India, to explore the feasibility of planting sugarcane in autumn as a relay intercrop in standing rice. The cropping systems evaluated were: i) rice-potato-spring sugarcane; ii) rice + autumn sugarcane (planted as a relay intercrop in every sixth row devoid (skipped) of transplanted rice + potato after rice; iii) rice-autumn sugarcane (planted without preparatory tillage) + potato; and iv) rice-autumn sugarcane (planted with preparatory tillage) + potato. In each case, sugarcane was planted in rows 90 cm apart. Rice was transplanted in rows at 20-cm row spacing when followed by potato or sugarcane, but at 18-cm row spacing when intended for sugarcane planting as a relay intercrop in late September. The germination (60.4%) of cane buds, tillers (323 000 ha(-1)) and number (149 000 ha(-1)), length (225 cm), girth (2.44 cm) and weight (747 g) of millable canes were markedly better when autumn sugarcane was planted with rice as a relay intercrop in comparison to other cropping systems. Similarly, this cropping system produced the maximum cane (111.4 t ha(-1)) and sugar (13.2 t ha(-1)) along with sugarcane equivalent yield (216.4 t ha(-1)). In turn, relay intercropping system with maximum cane production efficiency of 420 kg ha(-1) day(-1) fetched the highest economic returns (Rs. 258 ha(-1) day(-1)) and benefit: cost ratio (1.5). Compared with the rice-potato-spring sugarcane cropping system, the relay intercrop of autumn sugarcane in standing rice produced 35.4% more cane and 38.3% more sugar with 24.1% higher returns besides 79.1% energy saving. This practice will not only benefit cane growers and sugar mill owners in tropical and sub-tropical India, but also in other parts of the world where rice and sugarcane are extensively cultivated."

The Burkholderia sp. strain TNAU-1 inhibited the growth of all the toxigenic and non-toxigenic isolates of A. flavus in vitro and the inhibition zone ranged from 3.1-11.3 mm. A talc-based powder formulation of the Burkholderia sp was developed for field application. When groundnut seeds were treated with the formulation of Burkholderia sp., significant increases in root length, shoot length and seedling vigor were observed. Zimmu intercropping (once in every three rows of groundnut) alone significantly reduced the A. flavus infection and aflatoxin contamination in groundnut. Seed treatment at 10 g/kg or soil application at 2.5 kg/ha on 30, 45, 60 days after sowing with the formulation of Burkholderia sp. also resulted in significant reduction in the infection by A. flavus and aflatoxin B1 contamination in kernels. The maximum percentage reduction in aflatoxin B-1 content was achieved by the combination of zimmu intercropping, seed treatment and soil application of Burkholderia sp. Seed treatment followed by soil application with the formulation of Burkholderia sp. recorded the highest pod yield in both the field trials. Zimmu intercropping or seed treatment or soil application with formulation of Burkholderia sp. significantly reduced the population of A. flavus in the soil. Application of Burkholderia sp. through seed or soil resulted in high colonization of Burkholderia sp. in rhizosphere soil, and the rhizosphere population increased with increase in the age of the crop. A colony PCR assay was developed using primers made to Burkholderia sp. specific sequence of the ribosomal DNA for accurate detection and confirmation of Burkholderia sp.

The use of naturally colored fiber reduces chemical pollution. The objective of this paper was to evaluate cotton cultivar fiber yield in response to weed control via intercropping with gliricidia. Cultivars BRS Verde (greenish fibers), BRS-Rubi (reddish brown fibers), BRS-Safira (brown fibers), and BRS 187 811 (white fibers) were submitted to the following treatments: no hoeing, two hoeings (at 20 and 40 days after transplanting). and cotton intercropped with gliricidia. In the intercropped treatment, gliricidia was planted between rows of cotton plants, using one seedling pit (1). in pits spaced 50.0 cm apart. Twelve weed species predominated in the experiment, many of them belonging to the Poaceae family. Weeds occurred at different frequencies and in a non-uniform manner in the experimental area. Cultivars did not influence weed dry matter. Intercropping with gliricidia reduced weed dry matter but did not prevent reductions in cotton fiber and seed cotton yield, which were higher in hoed plots. Cultivar BRS Safira had the highest fiber yield, but no differences were observed between cultivars regarding to seed cotton yield.	"[Silva, P. S. L.; Silva, J. C., V; Freitas, F. C.

A fully factorial on-station experiment was conducted during the 1994 and 1995 rainy seasons at Sadore, Niger, combining application of: (i) broadcast millet residue (300, 900 and 2700 kg ha(-1)), (ii) broadcast cattle manure (300, 900 and 2700 kg ha-(1)) and (iii) mineral fertilizer (unfertilized control, 15 kg N ha(-1) + 4.4 kg P ha(-1) and 45 kg N ha(-1) + 13. l kg P ha(-1)). Manure and fertilizer increased millet yields in both years whereas residue was effective in 1995 only: The effect of manure and residue were additive, as was the effect of manure and fertilizer but only up to 50 kg N ha(-1). However in 1995, the response to fertilizer was approximately doubled in the presence of 900 or 2700 kg residue ha(-1) compared to fertilizer with 300 kg ha(-1) residue, indicating a strong synergistic effect. This synergistic effect was reflected in the partial factor productivity of nitrogen and phosphorous in both years. Two treatment combinations stand out as particularly relevant based on yield, partial factor productivity and nutrient balance criteria: 2700 kg manure ha(-1) combined with (i) 300 kg residue and no fertilizer (95% grain yield increase); (ii) 900 kg residue ha(-1) and 15 kg N + 4 kg P ha(-1) (132 % grain yield increase).

This article reviews some of the major results achieved with nonchemical methods and strategies, especially adapted for row crops (e.g., corn, sugar beet, onion, leek, and carrot) and small-grain cereals (e.g., barley and wheat). In row crops, intrarow weeds constitute a major challenge, and research has mainly aimed at replacing laborious hand-weeding with mechanization. A number of investigations have focused on optimizing the use of thermal and mechanical weeding methods against intrarow weeds, such as flaming, harrowing, brush weeding, hoeing, torsion weeding, and finger weeding. And new methods are now under investigation such as robotic weeding for row crops with abundant spacing between individual plants and band-steaming for row crops developing dense crop stands. The strategic use of mechanical weed control methods in small-grain cereals has been another area of considerable interest. Weed harrowing and interrow hoeing provide promising results when they are part of a strategy that also involves cultural methods such as fertilizer placement, seed vigor, seed rate, and competitive varieties. Although research in preventive, cultural, and physical methods have improved weed control in row crops and small-grain cereals, effective long-term weed management in low external input and organic systems can only be achieved by tackling the problem in a wider context, i.e., at the cropping system level. Basic principles of this approach, examples of cover crop and intercropping use for weed suppression, and an application in a 2-yr rotation are presented and discussed.

The seed yield of intercrop soybean (population converted to 100%) was 8.7% less than sole soybean whereas the grain yield of intercrop sorghum was 9.5% more than that of sole sorghum. However, the productivity in terms of soybean equivalent yield (SEY) was relatively high in intercropping system. The increasing NPK dose from 0% to 100% significantly improved SEY in sole sorghum and soybean/sorghum intercropping system and the integrated use of organics and inorganics recorded significantly more SEY than inorganics. The effect of nutrient management followed the order; 75% NPK + 5 t FYM ha(-1) > 75% NPK + 1.5 t PM ha(-1) > 75% NPK + 5 t PC ha(-1) > 100% NPK. Sorghum, both as sole and intercrop, responded more to PM while soybean to FYM. Application of 75% NPK in combination with PM or FYM or PC to preceding rainy season crops (soybean and sorghum) and 75% NPK to wheat produced significantly higher grain yield of wheat than those in inorganics and control indicating noticeable residual effect on the succeeding wheat crop and saving of 25% fertilizer-NPK. The effect of PC on rainy season crops was not as prominent as those of FYM and PM, but its residual effect on grain yield of wheat was comparable to those two organic manures. Among the cropping systems, soybean as preceding crop recorded the highest seed yield of wheat and was on a par with that of soybean/sorghum intercropping system. The yield of wheat following sorghum was the lowest. The total system productivity (TSP) was the highest in sorghum + soybean-wheat system and the lowest in the soybean-wheat system.

This 3-yr study estimated N credits and non-N nutritional effects for interseeded clover (Trifolium pratense L. 'Arlington') in spring wheat production (Triticum aestivum L. 'Algot') and assessed fall and spring nitrate (NO3-) in soil. The soil is a St. Urbain clay (Orthic Gleysol) located in the St. Lawrence lowlands. Ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) was applied at 0, 40, 80, 120 and 160 kg N ha(-1) with or without red clover as a companion crop. Clover was incorporated as a green manure crop in mid-November Clover significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) influenced wheat yield response to N fertilisation for 2 of the 3 yr. Clover did not reduce wheat grain yield through competition between the two plant species. Higher wheat yields with clover were attributed to N supplied by clover through mineralisation of residues incorporated in the soil the previous fall. Nitrogen fertiliser replacement value of clover was approximately 80 kg N ha(-1) for 1994 and 1995. Clover occasionally increased NO3--N measured in the soil profile in late fall and in spring. Interseeded red clover may provide most of the N needs of a companion spring wheat crop in fine-textured gleysolic soils, but is an inefficient N catch-crop.

J	"Rockstrom, J; deRouw, A"				"Rockstrom, J; deRouw, A"			Water, nutrients and slope position in on-farm pearl millet cultivation in the Sahel	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						"drought; manure; precision agriculture; spatial variability; water stress; yield components"	"TOPOSEQUENCE LAND TYPES; WEST-AFRICAN SAVANNA; PENNISETUM-TYPHOIDES; INTERCROP SYSTEMS; USE EFFICIENCY; SANDY SOIL; LEAF-AREA; NIGER; GROWTH; YIELD"	In the Sahel, short periods of intra-seasonal drought, caused by unfavourable rainfall distribution, often have stronger effect on crop growth than fluctuations in annual rainfall. The interactive effects of nutrient deficiency and water shortage (during panicle initiation, flowering and grain filling) on yield and yield components of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.), were studied on-farm along a cultivated slope, during three years with close to average annual rainfall. Grain yield was correlated to plant nutrient availability but not to annual rainfall, which was explained by the capacity of the crop to compensate for damage caused by water shortage during early growth phases. The performance of each yield component was positively correlated to cumulative rainfall during the growth phase when it was formed. Leaf area index (LAI) was very low, and leaf development followed rainfall distribution. Water and nutrients interacted during each growth phase for all fertility levels. Fertilised millet suffered less during water shortage at panicle initiation and at grain filling compared to non-fertilised miller. However, compared to favourable soil water conditions yield components were systematically lower for all treatments, indicating the synergistic effect of water and nutrients. The results suggest that water availability plays an exclusive role during flowering. Grain number dropped significantly due to water shortage and was similar for all treatments. Despite extremely high spatial variability in yields (varying with a factor 46 within the field), a significant slope effect was observed, of progressively increasing yields when moving downslope. Spatial redistribution of surface runoff resulting in higher soil water availability on lower slope positions, contributed to the yield gradient, which was reinforced for fertilised millet. For each drought period, yield components suffered systematically more upslope than downslope. This slope effect was smoothed out for manured millet, which indicates that manure increased soil infiltrability on crusted zones upslope. The slope interaction observed here - indicating that downslope (i) the risk for crop failure during droughts is lower and (ii) the response to fertilisers is greater - suggests that farmers can benefit relatively more from fertilisers applied in lower parts of the watershed. Taking advantage of spatial soil and water variability is an interesting system of low technology precision farming, which combined with water harvesting systems to master droughts, can constitute options for increased crop yields in the Sahel.

Greene] is a potential new crop source of an epoxy acid but grows slowly and does not yield the first summer. It could be intercropped that year. To evaluate Stokes aster's response to intercrop shade, plants were grown under 1010 [high light (HL)], 320 [medium light (ML)], or 120 now light (LL)] mu mol m(-2) s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) for 50 d prior to measurements of photosynthetic rate, light compensation point, light saturation point, chlorophyll concentration, and morphology of whole plants. Near light saturation points, LL and ML plants had the highest net CO2 assimilation based on leaf area and ML plants were highest based on land area. High light plants were least efficient due to a vertical Leaf orientation. As environment light intensity (LI) declined, plants had more chlorophyll per unit dry weight (DW), a higher chi b/chl a ratio, less leaf DW, less leaf area, and a lower root/shoot ratio. Light compensation points were 25, 55, and 185 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD for LL, ML, and HL plants, respectively. Saturation points were between 400 and 800 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for LL plants and between 800 and 1500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD for ML and EEL plants. In an intercrop, stokes aster should produce efficiently on a Leaf area basis but less efficiently on a land area basis when grown under a LI of 120 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) or less. Growth in full sun after the overstory crop is harvested would not be a problem for intercropped plants.

In the trials reported here, the advantages of relay cropping were compared with intercropping with improved management and intercropping under traditional management during the 1989, 1990 and 1991 rainy seasons at the ICRISAT Sahelian Center, Sadore, Niger. The length of the growing season varied from 139 to 150 days over the three seasons. The relay crop produced more dry matter and leaf area and yielded more than the intercrops in all three years, confirming that in years when the onset of the rains is early, relay cropping with millet and cowpea is a better option than growing the same two species as an intercrop. Relay cropping avoids the competitive effects inherent in intercropping systems, while offering the additional advantages of rotating cereals with legumes.

Eight cover-cropping regimes, including a weedy fallow control, were tested in a replicated trial. Cover crop significantly affected densities of the predominant predator, a bigeyed bug, Geocoris punctipes (Say), amid cover crops, on or near cantaloupe plants, and on or near sentinel egg masses of fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) pinned to cantaloupe leaves. No significant difference was found for proportions of egg masses occupied or damaged by predators. For all indices of predator abundance and efficiency, absolute responses were highest for the plots of subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L., 'Mt. Barker'). Numbers of G. punctipes per sentinel egg mass were significantly greater for the subterranean clover regime than for rye, crimson clover, and a polyculture of six cover crops, but were not significantly greater than for 'Vantage' vetch or the weedy fallow control plots. Rye showed particularly low densities of G. punctipes. Cover crops had no apparent effect on densities of aphids or whiteflies (Homoptera: Aphididae, Aleyrodidae) on cantaloupe leaves.

Shade influences many aspects of plant growth and development, leading to weak stems and susceptibility to lodging. The plant cell wall is composed of certain proteins that allow the walls to stretch out, a process called cell wall loosening. Shade affects anatomical, morphological, and physiological traits of plants, thus reducing the physical strength of the stem in crops by changing the loosening of cell walls. Flexibility of cells facilitates further modifications such as wall loosening. In addition, shade stress causes increased internode length, and reduced xylem synthesis and photosynthesis. In shaded plants, lignin deposition in vascular bundles and sclerenchyma cells of stems is decreased. Lignin is a light sensitive phenolic compound and shading decreases the transcript abundance of several phenolic compound (flavone and lignin) related genes. Shading significantly influences the metabolic activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), peroxidase (POD), 4-coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL), and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) involved in lignin biosynthesis. Furthermore, suppression of lignin biosynthesis activities by abiotic stresses causes abnormal phenotypes such as collapsed xylem, bent stems, and growth retardation. In this review, the underlying mechanisms illustrate that under shading conditions reduced lignin content results in slender, weak, and unstable stems. The objective of this review is to elaborate lignin biosynthesis and its variability under stressful environmental conditions, especially in shade stress environments. The effects of shade on stem lignin metabolism are discussed on the morphogenetic, physiological, and proteomic levels.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of weed removal from the field, removal after each hoeing, and corn intercropped with gliricidia on weed control and corn yield values. The experimental design consisted of blocks with split-plots and six replicates. Cultivars AG 1051 and BM 2022, planted in the plots, were submitted to the following treatments: no hoeing, two hoeings (at 20 and 40 days after planting), and intercropped with gliricidia. The hoed plots were either submitted to weed removal after the first, second, or both hoeings, or remained without weed removal. In the intercropped treatment, gliricidia was sown by broadcasting at corn planting between the corn rows, at a density of 15 seeds m(-2). Twenty-five weed species occurred in the experiment; the most frequent was Digitaria sanguinalis (family Poaceae). The weed control methods tested had similar effects on the cultivars, which were not different from one another with respect to the evaluated traits, except for one-hundred-kernel weight, with cultivar AG 1051 being superior. Weed removal did not influence green corn yield or grain yield. However, the number of kernels/ear was higher in plots where weeds were removed in relation to plots without weed removal, suggesting that weed removal might be beneficial to corn. Besides, a higher dry matter weight was obtained for the above-ground part of weeds removed from the field after the first and second hoeings than the weight of weeds removed after the second hoeing only which, in turn, was higher than the weight of weeds removed after the first hoeing only. Green ear yield, grain yield, and dry matter of the above-ground part of the weeds did not show differences in hoed plots and were superior to the non-weeded plots and the intercropped plots, which were not different from each other; therefore, intercropping with gliricidia did not improve corn yield values."

J	Kebede, E				Kebede, Erana			Contribution, Utilization, and Improvement of Legumes-Driven Biological Nitrogen Fixation in Agricultural Systems	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Review						"biological nitrogen fixation; cropping system; inoculation; legume residue; nutrient transfer"	"SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE; PRODUCTIVITY; INOCULATION; YIELD; RHIZODEPOSITION; BIOCONTROL; EFFICIENCY; GROWTH; MAIZE"	Legumes improve soil fertility through the symbiotic association with microorganisms, such as rhizobia, which fix the atmospheric nitrogen and make nitrogen available to the host and other crops by a process known as biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). Legumes included in the cropping system improve the fertility of the soil and the yield of crops. The advantages of legumes in the cropping system are explained in terms of direct nitrogen transfer, residual fixed nitrogen, nutrient availability and uptake, effect on soil properties, breaking of pests' cycles, and enhancement of other soil microbial activity. The best benefits from the legumes and BNF system can be utilized by integrating them into cropping systems. The most common practices to integrate legumes and their associated BNF into agricultural systems are crop rotation, simultaneous intercropping, improved fallows, green manuring, and alley cropping. However, the level of utilizing nitrogen fixation requires improvement of the systems, such as selecting appropriate legume genotypes, inoculation with effective rhizobia, and the use of appropriate agronomic practices and cropping systems. Therefore, using legumes at their maximum genetic potential, inoculation of legumes with compatible rhizobia, and using appropriate agronomic practices and cropping systems are very important for increasing food production. Importantly, the utilization of legumes as an integral component of agricultural practice in promoting agricultural productivity has gained more traction in meeting the demand of food production of the world populace. Priority should, thus, be given to value the process of BNF through more sustainable technologies and expansion of knowledge to the system.

High inputs, high outputs, low nutrient use efficiency, and increasing environmental pressure are typical characteristics of intensive farming systems in China. Achievement of high nutrient use efficiency and high crop productivity together is a major challenge for sustainability of Chinese intensive agriculture. Over the last 20 years crop yield has not increased proportionately with increasing fertilizer inputs, leading to low nutrient use efficiency and increasing environmental risk. Traditional nutrient management is highly dependent on the external fertilizer inputs but ignores exploiting the intrinsic biological potential of rhizosphere processes for efficient mobilization and acquisition of soil nutrients by crops. Several successful case studies on rhizosphere processes and management have been summarized in this chapter, and the results demonstrate that rhizosphere management provides a unique opportunity to harmonize crop productivity, nutrient efficiency, and environmental impact. Rhizosphere management strategies emphasize maximizing the efficiency of root and rhizosphere processes in nutrient acquisition and use by crops rather than solely depending on excessive application of chemical fertilizers. The strategies mainly include manipulating root system, rhizosphere acidification, carboxylate exudation, microbial associations with plants, rhizosphere interactions in terms of intercropping and rotation, localized application of nutrients, use of efficient crop genotypes, and synchronizing rhizosphere nutrient supply with crop demands. Rhizosphere management has been proved to be an effective approach to increasing nutrient use efficiency and crop productivity for sustainable agricultural production.

The hypothesis of the reported research was that, in an organically managed horticultural system, the use of living mulch (LM) promotes the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonization among neighboring roots, because of the coexistence of different plants roots in confined soil spaces. This effect determines nutrient uptake optimization, although roots belong to different plant species. In the reported 2-yr field experiment (2012-2013), two Italian artichoke cultivars [Cynara cardunculus L. var. scolymus (L.), Jesino cv. and Mazzaferrata cv.] were intercropped with a LM mixture of plant species and compared with a no LM control. Every year, the effect of LM on artichoke root morphology and AMF colonization was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, in order to assess abiotic and biotic rhizosphere interactions, as affected by artichoke cultivars. Also the artichoke yield, the soil available phosphorus (P) and rhizosphere P were determined. Results showed that the LM did not reduce yield of both the artichoke cultivars, when compared with the no LM ones. Furthermore, LM has: (i) induced structural changes in artichoke roots by proliferation of root hairs resulting in an increase of effective absorbing surface; (ii) promoted the rhizosphere mycorrhizal infection which improved P uptake. The modified rhizosphere interactions were found to be cultivar-dependent, being recorded only in Jesino artichoke."

The study investigated farmers' perceptions of the importance of stem-borer and farm practices influencing the pest. Sorghum farming was characterized by smallholdings with an average land size of 4.3 ha, an average family size of 6 and an average yield of 878 kg ha(-1) . Farmers cited pests, drought, and shortage of seed, land and labour as the main constraints upon sorghum production. Stem-borers were perceived to be the major pests requiring control. The majority of the farmers never applied chemical insecticides against stem-borers due to lack of capital and unavailability of insecticides. Because of restricted access to improved varieties, farmers largely used local cultivars of sorghum selected for yield potential but with little emphasis on insect resistance. Very few farmers destroyed sorghum residues after harvest. The majority of farmers grew sorghum under intercropping mainly due to the high yield expected. Crop rotation in sorghum fields was not widely practised due to land shortage.

EVALUATION OF CASSAVA VARIETIES FOR WEED TOLERANCE ABILITY	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article							"MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; MAIZE; PRODUCTIVITY; NIGERIA; AFRICA; PHYSIOLOGY; SAVANNA; GROWTH; FARMS; YIELD"	Many types of weeds occur in cassava fields causing enormous yield losses due to competition for nutrients, light and space. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the growth and yield of four traditional varieties of cassava (Bonoua Blanc, Tambou, Yasse and Six mois) produced in Cote d'Ivoire and select the highest tolerant variety to weed competition. Six treatments were induced by varying the period in which cassava varieties were grown with weeds. Varieties and exposure time to competition with weeds significantly affected the productivity of cassava. The number of leaves per plant (NLP), the number of tuberous roots per plant (NTRP) and the weight of tuberous roots per plant (WTRP) declined with increasing duration of weed presence. After an initial period of weeding, the first four months of grassing proved critical for the four varieties. Despite the presence of weeds, Bonoua Blanc has higher growth and yield than Tambou, Yasse and Six mois. This suggests that Bonoua Blanc was more tolerant to weed competition than the others from planting to harvest, being a suitable variety in intercropping systems.	"[Bi, Irie R.

Perennial cereal grain cultivation: Implication on soil organic matter and related soil microbial parameters	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY			English	Article						"Annual wheat; Functional genes; Intermediate wheatgrass (IWG); <p>Kernza & nbsp;(R)</p>; Microbial biomass; Soil organic carbon"	"ECOLOGICAL INTENSIFICATION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; EXOENZYME ACTIVITY; EXTRACTION METHOD; ENZYME-ACTIVITY; CARBON; BIOMASS; CROP; BIODIVERSITY; AGRICULTURE"	Novel perennial grains in agriculture have the potential of providing soil ecosystem services and boosting plantsoil microbial relationships via increasing soil organic matter (SOM). Hence, we evaluated the implication of perennial intermediate wheatgrass agroecosystems (+/- alfalfa intercrop) in contrast to organic and conventional rotation systems on SOM and related soil microbial parameters. Soil samples were obtained from perennial intermediate wheatgrass (IWG), sole (IWG-SC) or intercropped with alfalfa (IWG-IC), as well as organic (ORG-A) and conventional (CON-A) rotation systems of annual wheat. Soil samples were taken in two depths (0-30 cm and 30-60 cm) and analyzed for total and fractionated soil organic C (SOC), microbial biomass C and N (MBC and MBN), basal microbial respiration (Rb), potential enzyme activities related to C and N cycling (Cellobiohydrolase (CBH), Leucine-aminopeptidase (LAP)), and abundance of functional genes related to N cycling (amoA, nifH) and 16S rRNA genes. Despite the lack of fertilization in the IWG systems, SOC concentration and the amount of C in the particulate organic matter were higher in the 30-60 cm depth of IWG systems than ORG-A and CON-A. Higher MBN and LAP activities were observed in the 0-30 cm depth of ORG-A than both IWG and CON-A. Mass specific CBH activities and metabolic quotient qCO(2) were lower in the 30-60 cm depth of IWG systems, implying reduced C losses and high C use efficiency in these systems. Similarly, we observed higher amounts of 16S rRNA in the 30-60 cm depth of IWGs than ORG-A and CON-A. Hence, IWG systems increased SOC and microbial biomass and activities in the 30-60 cm depth than ORG-A and CON-A. However, the more diverse IWG (+ alfalfa intercrop) did not increase microbial biomass and activities than IWG monoculture. Our study provides a reflection of how perennial grain agroecosystems, in conjunction with organic rotation systems, induce a positive influence on SOC and microbial activities than CON-A. It further suggested that perennial grain cultivation goes beyond the reach of organic farming dominated by annual crops to induce SOC and support relevant soil microbial functions in subsoils.

In this study, we assess the impact of several diversification practices in different management regimes on the main carbon fluxes regulating the soil carbon balance under semiarid Mediterranean conditions. Methods The study was conducted in two nearby cropping systems: (i) a low input rainfed almond (Prunus dulcis Mill.) orchard cultivated on terraces and (ii) a levelled intensively irrigated mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco) orchard with a street-ridge morphology. The almond trees were intercropped with Capparis spinosa or with Thymus hyemalis While the mandarin trees were intercropped with a mixture of barley and vetch followed by fava bean. Changes caused by crop diversifications on C inputs into the soil and C outputs from the soil were estimated. Results Crop diversification did not affect soil organic carbon stocks but did affect the carbon inputs and outputs regulating the soil carbon balance of above Mediterranean agroecosystems. Crop diversification with perennials in the low-input rainfed woody crop system significantly improved the annual soil C balance in the short-term. However, crop diversification with annual species in the intensively managed woody crop system had not effect on the annual soil C balance. Conclusions Our results highlight the potential of intercropping with perennials in rainfed woody crop systems for climate change mitigation through soil carbon sequestration.

Soil compaction reduces crop production due to restrictions on root development. Management strategies combining crop rotation and soil conservation practices still need to be researched as potential strategies to mitigate no-till soil physical constraints in tropical regions with prolonged drought periods and still promote agricultural sustainability. The objective of this study was to determine if soil specific management could mitigate early-stage no-till compaction and improve least limiting water range in a Rhodic Ferralsol. We hypothesized that no-till cropping systems with concomitant conservation practices -soil fertilization, crop rotation, and intercropped brachiaria grass- would improve soil physical quality (SPQ) and still achieve high crop yields in a tropical region with dry winters and frequent dry spells during wet season. Six no-till cropping systems were tested: soybean monoculture (T1); corn monoculture (T2); corn and soybean rotation (T3); corn and soybean rotation with intercropped brachiaria (T4); and two more with increased fertilization: corn and soybean rotation with inter cropped brachiaria (T5), and corn and soybean rotation (T6). Least limiting water range (LLWR) was used as an indicator of SPQ. LLWR is computed as a function of bulk density (Bd), and it is defined as the range of soil water content in which physical constraints to plant growth are at minimal. Its critical limits are water contents associated with field capacity and air-filled porosity (upper limits), along with wilting point and soil resistance (lower limits). For each Bd, there is a LLWR value: the span between the upper limit and the lower limit. An adaptation of LLWR, in which we substituted the wilting point by the critical water content (theta*), was also tested (LLWR*). Critical Bd (BdC) value was 1.30 Mg m3 for LLWR and LLWR*. In monoculture treatments (T1 and T2) the maximum Bd values exceeded the BdC (LLWR = LLWR *= 0) and negatively correlated with crop yield. Alternatively, cropping systems with diverse crop rotation (corn/soybean/brachiaria) showed greater values of LLWR and LLWR* and less soil compaction than monoculture systems. Usage of LLWR* evinced water stress was the main limiting plant growth factor; viz. theta* was more limiting than mechanical resistance and deficient aeration. These results support the hypothesis that the use of soil conservation practices and crop rotation during initial years of no-till farming contributes favorably to SPQ without compromising crop production."

The study also examined the correlations between AMF occurrence and soil carbon stocks. Results revealed that RS crop rotation system significantly enhances the occurrence of AMF spores in soil with a higher fraction of large sized spores, the total organic C (TOC), microbial biomass C (MBC), water soluble C (WSC), labile C and a high AMF colonization in rice roots in the subsequent rice cultivation season. The diversity of AMF morphospecies were also the highest in RS. Reduction in AMF density in the soil in RR crop rotation system may be due to prolonged anaerobic conditions prevailed. The growth of onion has drastically reduced the AMF colonization in rice and soil C contents. Soil carbon stocks showed positive correlations with % root colonization and AMF spore number in soil. Thus, the study confirmed that C stocks in paddy soils can be improved by intercropping with AMF supporting plants like soya bean. This is the first report that shows positive correlations of AMF sporulation and % root colonization in lowland rice with soil carbon stocks.	"[Paranavithana, T. M.; Ratnayake, R.

Triticum aestivum (wheat), Zea mays (corn), Oryza saliva (rice), Glycine max (soybean) and Btussicajuncea (mustard) were observed in the Tarai area of Uttarakhand in 2017-18. Different concentrations (0%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% w/v indicated as T0, T1, T2, T3 and T4, respectively) of Jattvphastem aqueous extract were bio-assayed against germination and seedling growth (plumule and radicle length) of the experimental crops. Significant differences in the normal germination between crops as well as their varieties were observed. Seed germination was significantly reduced (P<0.05) in all crop varieties in all the treatments. However, the reduction was more significant in T4 treatment in all the crops. The Response Index (RI) values ranged from minimum (-0.006) in mustard variety Kranti to maximum (-0.412) in rice variety Govind. The plumule length was significantly reduced (p<0.05) in all the crop varieties and in all the treatments except in T1 treatment. RI values ranged from -0.021 in soybean variety PS-1225 to 0.634 in rice variety Govind at T1 and T4 treatments, respectively. Some crop varieties showed stimulation effect on plumule length, i.e. +0.038 (Govind variety of rice) and +0.237(UP-2526 variety of wheat) at T1 and T2 treatments, respectively. The radicle length was significantly (p<0.05) reduced in all the crop varieties and in all the treatments.

These detrimental nontarget effects motivate the use of alternative pest management strategies such as host plant resistance and intercropping. However, when alternative pest management strategies effectively suppress primary pests, they also have the potential to promote secondary pest populations via competitive release. The potato leafhopper (Empoasca fabae) is a key pest of alfalfa, and leafhopper-resistant cultivars are being widely adopted by growers in the Midwest and Northeast United States. We conducted a field experiment comparing leafhopper-susceptible alfalfa, leafhopper-resistant alfalfa, and leafhopper-resistant alfalfa intercropped with orchardgrass. Leafhopper-resistant alfalfa reduced potato leafhopper abundance and protected the crop from protein loss, but there was no benefit of intercropping leafhopper-resistant alfalfa with orchardgrass. Importantly, the abundance of a secondary pest, the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), was twice as high in the leafhopper-resistant plant treatments compared to the leafhopper-susceptible treatment. Field sampling and microcosm experiments confirmed that the increase in pea aphids was caused, at least in part, by release from competition with leafhoppers. These results suggest that, when host plant resistance against insects is employed, efforts to monitor and manage secondary pest populations are warranted.

They properly modify the composition of soil microorganisms and can protect of plants from phytopathogens. The purpose of the field and laboratory studies was to determine the quantitative and qualitative composition of microorganisms in the soil under carrot cultivated with the use of oats, tansy phacelia and spring vetch as cover crops. The paper presents also studies on soil-borne fungi threatening the healthiness of carrot roots. In the conventional cultivation of carrot the population of bacteria (including Pseudomonas spp. and Bacillus spp.) was the smallest, while after the application of oats it was the largest. Oats and spring vetch were most effective in limiting the occurrence of soil-borne fungi. Those plants and tansy phacelia caused an increase of the population of saprotrophic fungi (Albifimbria spp., Clonostachys spp. and Trichoderma spp.) in the soil. Intercrop plants had a positive effect on the healthiness of carrot seedlings and roots. Allernaria dauci, A. allernata, A. radicina, Fusarium oxysporum, Globisporangium irregulars, Neocosmospora &demi, Phylophthora sp., Rhizoctonia solani and Sclerotinia sclerotioruni proved to be the most harmful towards the studied underground parts of carrot.

The two villages were selected for this study and two groups of farmers were selected namely, a group adopting the Agromet Advisories (40 famers), regularly in their operation (AAS Farmers) and other group of farmers not aware of Agromet Advisories (Non AAS Farmers). In these two villages total 80 farmers was identified, AAS information issued for only 40 farmers in two villages during kharif season and care was taken to implement the advisories by this group. The crop situation of these farmers was compared with nearby fields having the same crops, where forecast is not adopted in Non AAS farmers field. The data was recorded from both the farmers group particularly on crops expenditure incurred by the farmers from land preparation to harvest at every stage, has been worked out and crop growth and yields were observed regularly. The result observed that those farmers who adopted AAS information and implemented it in their field, found the better crop growth and high yield over the non adopted AAS farmers. The net income of AAS farmers was about Rs. 35, 000 for soybean and Rs. 1, 31, 525 for intercropping of cotton + black gram while non AAS farmers about Rs. 22, 500 and Rs. 87, 475 respectively.

The aim of this study was to determine how different strategies for recycling residual and green-manure biomass influence yield and N concentration of the edible parts of food crops in a stockless organic cropping system. For this purpose, three biomass distribution treatments were investigated in a field experiment, based on a cropping system designed to produce both high-quality food crops and biomass resources from crop residues, cover crops and a green-manure ley. The three treatments, applied at the cropping system level, were: (1) incorporating the aboveground biomass resources in situ (IS); (2) harvesting, ensiling and redistributing the same biomass resources to the non-legume crops (biomass redistribution, BR); and (3) harvesting, ensiling and using the biomass resources as substrate for production of bio-methane via anaerobic digestion (AD) followed by distribution of the digestate as bio-fertilizer to the non-legume crops. The redistribution of ensiled (BR) and digested (AD) biomass did not increase the yield of the edible parts in winter rye (Secale cereal L.), white cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.) or red beet (Beta vulgaris L.) compared with leaving the biomass on the ground at harvest (IS). The BR treatment increased the yield of lentil intercropped with oat, compared with IS treatment in one of the two studied years. The total biomass yield of the cover crop following winter rye was significantly higher in the BR treatment than in IS in both years. The legume proportion in the green-manure ley was significantly higher in the AD and BR treatments as compared with IS in one of the experimental years. This study showed that strategic biomass redistribution has the potential to enhance biomass productivity while maintaining food crop yields, thereby enhancing whole system productivity. Biomass redistribution systems both with and without biogas digestion offer a new strategy for the development of multifunctional arable cropping systems that rely on internal nutrient cycling."

CA was expected to become an effective countermeasure against water erosion in the Sudan Savanna, but it has not been adopted by local smallholder farmers. As markets for grain legumes (including cowpea) have not been developed in the Sudan Savanna, crop rotation/association should be considered impractical for these farmers. Therefore, we examined whether legume intercropping as a crop rotation/association component is necessary for preventing soil erosion in the Sudan Savanna. Three-year field experiments were conducted in runoff plots at Institute of Environment and Agricultural Research Saria station. The four treatments were conventional practice (full tillage, no sorghum residue mulching, and no intercropping), two-component CA (minimum tillage (MT) and sorghum residue mulching without intercropping), and three-component CA with velvet bean (VB) or pigeon pea (PP) intercropping. It was revealed that: (1) MT and sorghum residue mulching (without intercropping) effectively reduced the annual soil loss by 54% mainly due to the improvement of soil permeability by the boring of termites and wolf spiders found under the sorghum stover mulch; (2) intercropping in combination with MT and crop residue mulching had no effect on soil erosion control mainly because: (a) PP did not survive the long dry season; (b) VB did not serve effectively as a cover crop since soil loss was concentrated at the beginning of the rainy season when VB was still too small; (c) unexpectedly, in combination with MT and crop residue mulching, intercropping with VB did not increase mulch biomass, especially sorghum biomass which prompts the boring of termites and wolf spiders. These results demonstrate that the third component of CA, namely legume intercropping, is not always necessary; rather, the two remaining components - minimum soil disturbance and soil cover are sufficient for soil conservation in the Sudan Savanna. This finding lightens the burden of adopting CA and thus facilitates its future promotion to the smallholder farmers in the Sudan Savanna."

Crop Diversification Options Involving Pulses and Sugarcane for Improving Crop Productivity, Nutritional Security and Sustainability in India	SUGAR TECH			English	Review						"Crop residue recycling; Horizontal expansion; Intercropping; Non-traditional areas; Sugarcane-based diversification system"	"NITROGEN; YIELD"	Pulses have very good opportunity to find place in different agro-ecosystems. Nowadays, soil organic carbon and crop productivity have become major concerns in sustainable agriculture. Since last six decades in our country, improvement in productivity of most of the field crops has been obtained but much success could not be achieved in increasing area and productivity of pulse crops. From 1980-1981 to 2013-2014, the total cropped area under pulses in India increased from 22.46 to 25.21 m ha with the peak of 26.40 m ha in 2010-2011. Due to stagnant production and an increase in population, the per capita availability of pulses has been declined in the range of 35.4 g to 47.2 g/capita/day during 2009-2014. Significant increment in area and productivity of pulse crops is possible by intercropping of these crops with sugarcane which is grown in more than 5.15 million ha area in India. Thus, in irrigated agro-ecosystem, there is a great scope of increasing area under pulse crops through crop diversification/intensification besides improving their productivity. Adoption of pulse crops with autumn (October)-planted cane in furrow-irrigated raised-bed system where sugarcane is planted in furrows and component crop is planted on raised beds also provides great scope for increasing crop productivity and optimizing input use efficiencies in the system. Crop residues recycling of pulses addresses the key issue of decreasing soil organic carbon created due to indiscriminate/imbalanced use of fertilizers and lower use/unavailability of organic manures. Mechanization of diversified cropping systems will certainly boost the adoption of recommended technologies by the farmers. Various tractor-drawn implements for planting of sugarcane and component pulse crops have been developed. Mechanical harvesters for pulse crops have already been developed and are being used by the farmers. Thus, cost of production could be reduced and profitability may be increased with introduction of these crops in irrigated agro-ecosystem besides improving soil fertility and sustainability for longer period. In present paper, authors presented the opportunities of agronomic interventions for pulse crops in sugarcane-based system to improve the crop productivity, profitability and sustainability.

Investigations into its growth and development performance on different host plants can provide an understanding of the potential for increase of S. litura population in the field. We measured the development time, body weight, and head capsule width of S. litura larvae reared on cabbage, taro, peanut, and sesbania, a green manure. Larvae reared on cabbage ingested a significantly higher amount of protein and completed the immature stages in a shorter period than those reared on the other three plants. The relationship between head capsule width and larval instars on these four crops fitted well with Dyar's rule, and the Dyar's ratios ranged from 1.4554 to 1.6786, although a few supernumerary instar individuals on sesbania, peanut, and taro showed lower ratios (1.0103 to 1.1330). The head capsule width among cohorts fed on different host plants varied significantly and overlapped between late instars, which could lead to a misjudgment of instar stage in the field. The growth index of S. litura on cabbage was significantly higher than on the other host plants. Larvae fed on sesbania showed the highest feeding index and a better growth index than on taro and peanut. We therefore suggest that the area-wide pest management against S. litura should take into consideration its occurrence on sesbania in intercropping seasons. Additionally, the effective management of this pest during cropping windows between all these four plants should not be ignored.

(Euphorbiaceae) in Burkina Faso and several other West African countries. Adults severely defoliate plants, resulting in seedling mortality, poor growth, and low yields. To study the population dynamics of the pest in the Sissili Province of Burkina Faso, 12 sites were monitored weekly during a year and 31 sites were inspected for damage at the peak period of insect abundance. The effect of cropping systems (hedge, intercropping, and monoculture) and surrounding vegetation on population densities of A. whitfieldi was assessed. Beetles were rarely found in the dry season and peaked in the second half of the rainy season. The cropping system did not significantly influence the abundance and attack level. In contrast, the close vicinity of fallow lands seems to increase damage levels. Many aspects of the biology and ecology of A. whitfieldi remain to be investigated before sustainable control methods can be developed. However, this study already allows us to propose recommendations for further research on management.

The objective of this study was to improve switchgrass stand establishment through integrated management practices that included cover crops, tillage systems and herbicide application. The study was conducted at the University of Massachusetts Agricultural Experiment Station in Deerfield during the growing seasons of 2012 and 2013. A split split-plot design with three replications was used in both years. The main plots consisted of three cover crop treatments (fallow, oat [Avena sativa L.], and rye [Secale cereale L.]). The sub-plots were two seeding methods (no-till drill, and cultipacker seeder [Brillion]). The sub sub-plots were herbicide treatments that consisted (1) pre-emergence (PRE) application of atrazine (A) and quinclorac (Q) and (2) a Broad Spectrum application of PRE A + Q that was supplemented with post-emergence (POST) application of 2,4-D and dicamba. The no-till seeding method in both years resulted in higher stand density and biomass. Weed control was improved with the Broad Spectrum herbicide (0.90 Mg ha(-1)) compared with A + Q treatment (1.3 Mg ha(-1)). No-till seeding produced considerably higher tiller numbers (190 tiller m(-2)) than that of cultipacker seeder which in turn resulted in significant weed suppression. In general, when planted after rye, switchgrass produced fewer tillers than after oat or fallow. No-till seeding into oat mulch with the application of Broad Spectrum herbicides resulted in highest switchgrass yield (2,098 kg ha(-1)) in the establishment year.

The effectiveness of five aromatic non-host plants, Corymbia citriodora (Hook.) (Myrtaceae), Ocimum basilicum L. (Lamiaceae), Lavandula pinnata L. (Lamiaceae), Ruta graveolens L. (Rutaceae), and Rosmarinus officinalis L. (Lamiaceae), was investigated to determine their ability to suppress E.vitis on tea plants. Volatile organic compounds derived from L.pinnata, R.officinalis, and C.citriodora were found to repel leafhoppers and to mask the host's odors. Intercropping L.pinnata and C.citriodora with tea plants significantly reduced the E.vitis population levels in the tea plantation associated with higher population densities of generalist predators. The volatile compounds from the five non-host plants were collected by headspace absorption under field conditions, and the 10 major components were identified. Qualitative and quantitative differences were found among the five odor profiles. Moreover, the emission dynamics of non-host volatiles were monitored. Non-host volatile emissions showed two peak periods, one in the spring and one in the autumn period. These peaks were almost consistent with the population dynamics of E.vitis. Our findings suggested that this newer approach to ecologically based, sustainable pest management implemented via intercropping with non-host aromatic plants such as L.pinnata and C.citriodora offers a promising alternative to chemical control of the leafhopper population.

The total population of fungi in the soil after the cultivation of oats was twice as low as after the cultivation of tansy phacelia. A little smaller fungi population was obtained as a result of mulching the soil with spring vetch in comparison to that after the cultivation of tansy phacelia. The proportion of Fusarium spp., Alternaria alternata, Pythium irregulare and Thanatephorus cucumeris isolated from the soil after the cultivation of oats was the lowest one, while being a little higher after the cultivation of spring vetch, and the highest after tansy phacelia. The greatest number of antagonistic fungi occurred in the soil after ploughing in the mulch of oats. Antagonistic fungi isolated from the soil mulched with oats were the most effective in limiting the growth and development of A. alternata, Fusarium culmorum, E oxysporum, Haematonectria haematococca, P. irregulare and T cucumeris since the value of their antagonistic effect was the largest. The lowest antagonistic activity of fungi was found out after using tancy phacelia.

The present study aimed to assess the effect of green manure on the nutritional status of orange trees cultivar 'Pera' (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck). The plants were grafted on 'Cravo' lime trees and were then planted in a 7x4m space. Four different treatments corresponding to the evaluated green manures were employed: jack bean (JB) (Canavalia ensiformis DC), lablab (LL) (Dolichos lablab L.), pigeon pea (PP) (Cajanus cajan L.

The experimental design was in randomized blocks, in split-plot time, with six replicates, with four treatments (green manures) and two plants per evaluation. The nutritional status was assessed by using the DRIS method (Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System); the yield and the macro and micronutrient levels contained in green manures and in the control was also determined. The nutritional diagnosis indicated that, in the two years of experiment, plants treated with green manure showed better nutritional balance index compared to Brachiaria. This suggests that, over time, green manure can lead to better nutritional balance.

Agronomic performance of organic cotton and oilseed crops in combination with forage palm	REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL			Portuguese	Article						"intercropping; oil production; family agriculture"		"The aim of this study was to evaluate the agronomic performance of organic cotton and oilseed crops in combination with forage palm in the semi-arid region of Paraiba, Brazil. In the 2009 crop year, an experiment was conducted in two areas: (I) at the farm Vila Maria Rita, located in the municipality of Taperoa in the 'Cariri' region of Paraiba, and (II) at the settlement of Queimadas, located in Remigio in the 'Curimatau' region of Paraiba. The treatments, separated into individual crop and in combination (intercropping), were: cotton + sesame + forage palm, cotton + peanut + forage palm; cotton + forage palm, cotton alone; sesame alone; sunflower alone; peanut alone, and forage palm alone. The variables analyzed were: technological characteristics of fibers, yield (seeds/boll), oil yield, fiber yield, gross income and efficient use of land (UET), partial and total. For fiber yield, the combination of cotton + forage palm provided the best result (311.14 kg ha(-1)), while peanut alone had the greatest yield in seeds (967.00 kg ha(-1)) and in oil (428.02 kg ha(-1)). The combination of cotton + sesame + forage palm may be an efficient alternative for family agriculture since it showed positive results in terms of gross income and UET total."

The paper presents studies on fungi threatening the cultivation of scorzonera. Soil mulching with intercrop cover crops such as oats, tansy phacelia and spring vetch had a positive effect on the population and healthiness of the seedlings and the roots of the studied plant. The following fungi were most frequently isolated from the infected underground organs of scorzonera: Alternaria alternata, A. scorzonerae, Botrytis cinerea, Cylindrocarpon didymum, Fusarium culmorum, F. oxysporum, F. solani, Rhizoctonia solani, Phytophthora sp. and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Among the applied mulching plants, oats proved to be the most effective in inhibiting the occurrence of the enumerated fungi species.

However, the majorities of such studies were mainly performed under pot experiments, relatively little research has examined the direct and indirect effects of associated cover crop of peanut with fertilization by combined application of organic and inorganic sources of nitrogen under field conditions. We compared soil chemical and biological parameters of Bt cotton with pure crop of peanut to arrive on a valid conclusion. Significantly higher dehydrogenase enzyme activity and KMnO4-N content of soil were observed in Bt cotton with cover crop of peanut over pure Bt cotton followed by pure peanut at all the crop growth stages. However, higher microbial population was maintained by pure peanut over intercropped Bt cotton, but these differences were related to the presence of high amount of KMnO4-N content of soil. By growing cover crop of peanut between Bt cotton rows, bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes population increased by 60%, 14%, and 10%, respectively, over Bt cotton alone. Bt cotton fertilized by combined application of urea and farm yard manure (FYM) maintained higher dehydrogenase enzyme activity, KMnO4-N content of soil and microbial population over urea alone. Significant positive correlations were observed for dry matter accumulation, dehydrogenase enzyme activity, KMnO4-N content, and microbial population of soil of Bt cotton, which indicates no harmful effects of Bt cotton on soil biological parameters and associated cover crop. Our results suggest that inclusion of cover crop of peanut and FYM in Bt cotton enhanced soil chemical and biological parameters which can mask any negative effect of the Bt toxin on microbial activity and thus on enzymatic activities.

Nitrogen fixation in annual and perennial legume-grass mixtures across a fertility gradient	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						"Agroecosystem; Cover crops; Facilitation; Functional diversity; Intercrops; Nutrient cycling"	"N-15 NATURAL-ABUNDANCE; WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; N-2 FIXATION; WHITE CLOVER; CROPPING SYSTEMS; RED-CLOVER; N TRANSFER; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; PASTURE LEGUMES; COVER CROPS"	The selection of legume species and species mixtures influences agroecosystem nitrogen (N) and carbon cycling. We utilized a fertility gradient to investigate the effects of plant species interactions on biological N fixation of an annual and perennial legume in response to shifting soil resource availability. Legume N fixation of annual field pea (Pisum sativum) and perennial red clover (Trifolium pratense) grown in monoculture and mixtures with oats (Avena sativa) or orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata) was estimated using the N-15 natural abundance method across 15 farm fields and we measured six soil N pools ranging from labile to more recalcitrant. Evidence of complementary and facilitative species interactions was stronger for the perennial red clover-orchardgrass mixture than for the annual field pea-oat mixture (N Land Equivalency Ratios were 1.6 and 1.2, respectively). We estimated that the transfer of fixed N from red clover to orchardgrass increased aboveground N fixation estimates by 15% from 33 to 38 kg N ha(-1). Despite a more than 2-fold range in soil organic matter levels and more than 3-fold range in labile soil N pools across field sites, the N fertility gradient was not a strong predictor of N fixation. While grass N assimilation was positively correlated with soil N pools, we found only weak, inverse correlations between legume N fixation and soil N availability. In grass-legume mixtures, soil N availability indirectly influenced N fixation through plant competition. These results suggest that increasing diversity of cropping systems, particularly through the incorporation of perennial mixtures into rotations, could improve overall agroecosystem N cycling efficiency.

Habitat management is a strategy aiming at enriching the biodiversity and favoring natural enemies in agricultural systems. However, the peak of the dynamically changing population of natural enemies must cope with that of pests for effective control. Therefore, in the present study the dynamic relations between pests and natural enemies under the conservation practices were clarified by a habitat manage experiment. Plant residuals were mulched along the walls of the greenhouse as habitat for the natural enemies such as spiders and carabids before the pests appeared in the plots, where a cabbage crop was intercropped into a tomato crop. During the growth period of crops, the density of pests and predators were examined and analyzed with mathematic model as P-1=P-B1+ {P-max - P-B1 - P-Y1[1-beta(1)(t-tau)(2)]}EXP[-alpha(1)(t-tau)(2)] + P-Y1[1-beta(1)(t-tau)(2)] (t <=tau) and P-2 = P-B2 + {P-max - P-B2 - P-Y2[1-beta(2) (t-tau)(2)]}EXP [-alpha(2)(t-tau)(2)]+P-Y2 [1-beta(2)(t-tau)(2)] (t >=tau). It was concluded that the habitat management for natural enemies with plant residues placed along the walls in greenhouses favored natural enemies, especially before the appearance of pest insect, and controlled the pests effectively to a lower level.

This study aimed to evaluate dry matter production and nutrients accumulation by pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), in sole crop and intercropped, and the effect of straw mulch mechanical management on out-of-season castor bean performance, in no-tillage system establishment. The experiment was carried out on a Rhodic Nitisol, in Botucatu, SP, Brazil. A randomized blocks design, in a split-plot scheme, with four replications, was used. Plots were composed by cover crops (pigeonpea, pearl millet, and pigeonpea-pearl millet intercropping). Subplots were composed by absence or presence of straw mulch mechanical management, by horizontal crusher use, 20 days after chemical management. Pearl millet sole crop produced greater amounts of dry matter (14,040 kg ha(-1)) and showed higher K and Mg concentrations, accumulated greater amounts of nutrients in aboveground. Castor bean grain yield was higher in succession to pigeonpea-pearl millet intercropping. Castor bean grain yield was higher in the absence of straw mulch mechanical management.

Volatilization of PCB-5 from the soil surface was also tested. The results show that while uptake of PCB-5 by the test plant species is possible and the root concentration of PCB-5 had a control on the upward transport of PCB-5 to the above-ground portion of the plants, the PCB-5 extracted by the plants mainly accumulated in the root materials. Phytoextraction contributed insignificantly toward the loss of the soil-borne PCB-5. Volatilization of PCB-5 from the soil was recorded but it appeared that this did not result in a marked loss of PCB-5 in the bulk soil though it might cause remarkable removal of PCB-5 in a thin layer of the topsoil (1 mm). It is likely that the in-soil biodegradation contributed markedly to the observed reduction in soil-borne PCB-5. The in-soil biodegradation of PCB-5 was significantly enhanced under intercropping conditions, which appeared to be related to increased microbial activities, particularly bacterial activities. The soil residual PCB-5 was correlated with the activity of the following enzymes: catalase (CAT), polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The seedbank depletion of Striga was measured in Mali and Niger during the 2004 rainy season under the host crops, pearl millet and sorghum, the non-host crops, cowpea and sesame, the intercrops of pearl millet or sorghum with cowpea or sesame, and fallow with or without weeding. Two methods were used and compared; namely, a seed bag method and a soil-sampling method. The fate of the seeds was assessed by a seed press test. Seed germination, as determined by the presence of empty seed coats, contributed most to the seedbank depletion of Striga under a variety of crop covers and fallow. The highest seedbank depletion was found under the monocultures of the host crops. The intercrops of the host and non-host crops caused less seedbank depletion, followed by the monocultures of the non-host crops, fallow, and bare soil. The seed bag method and the soil-sampling method yielded similar percentages of seedbank depletion, while the former allowed for distinguishing between the germinated and diseased seeds. The results suggest that, although all the tested crop species can cause the seed germination and seedbank depletion of Striga, management by using host cereal crops causes the highest amount of germination and has the highest potential to deplete the soil seed bank, provided that seed production is prevented."

Relay cropping cauliflower with lettuce as a means to manage first-generation cabbage maggot (Diptera : Anthomyiidae) and minimize cauliflower yield loss	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						"cabbage maggot; diversification; relay cropping; intercropping; pest management"	"HOST-PLANT SELECTION; ROOT FLY; BRUSSELS-SPROUTS; NITROGEN STATUS; DELIA-RADICUM; PEST INSECTS; OVIPOSITION; CROPS; FLIES; DIVERSITY"	First-generation cabbage maggot, Delia radicum (L.) (Diptera: Anthomyiidae), can cause extensive damage to newly transplanted brassica crops. This study investigated the use of relay cropping, a form of intercropping that involves overlapping two crops in the same field for a short period, as a means to 1) reduce first-generation D. radicum egg numbers by disrupting female host finding and 2) minimize yield loss by reducing the time that crops overlap. Because of the high incidence of two other Delia species, Delia platura (Meigen) and Delia florilega (Zetterstedt), treatment effects on these insects also were considered. In both years of the study (2003 and 2004), there were fewer D. radicum eggs collected from the base of cauliflower, Brassica oleracea variety botrytis, plants relay cropped with lettuce, Lactuca sativa L., than in monoculture. D. platural D. florilega also laid fewer eggs on cauliflower in the relay crop than in monoculture in 2003, but in 2004 the opposite was true, there were more D. platura / D. florilega eggs laid on the relay-cropped cauliflower. After peak D. radicum oviposition, the lettuce was harvested. Cauliflower curd weights and diameters were comparable between treatments in both years. Plant loss because of D. platura / D. florilega feeding in the 2004 relay-cropped plots resulted in reduced yields in these plots compared with the monoculture. Although further investigation is needed into the effects of relay cropping on other pests within this system, this is the first study to demonstrate that relay cropping can reduce egg laying by D. radicum at the scale studied while minimizing competition between component crops for key resources.

A long-term study was established in 2000 to investigate the effect of crop rotation and frequency of inclusion on the success of PFP, as well as the effect of PFP on subsequent crops in the rotation. The crop rotations being compared were linola-oat-canola-wheat and linola-oat-alfalfa-alfalfa. PFP occurred either once in the rotation (oat) or twice (linola-oat). Weed density and yield were measured in the crops that followed PFP. Oat was a more successful PFP crop than linola because it was better able to compete with weeds. Furthermore, PFP oat had a higher weed density when it followed PFP linola, but this did not influence PFP oat yield. Under the conditions of this study, PFP linola was more successful in the annual crop rotation. Inclusion of alfalfa hay crops in the crop rotation was not effective in lowering weed pressure and, in fact, may have contributed to an increase in weed density. It is concluded that weed species present influenced the effectiveness of alfalfa in facilitating PFP, because major weeds in the study are not effectively controlled by alfalfa. PFP did not have a negative effect on following crops in the rotation (i.e. canola-wheat or alfalfa), regardless of whether one or two consecutive years of PFP occurred in the rotation. No additional herbicide was necessary for weed control in the crops that followed PFP; however, alfalfa hay was weedier for the first year following PFP. This study indicates that PFP is a viable way to reduce herbicide use in a cropping system and that attention needs to be paid to PFP crop selection and crop rotation, particularly when the PFP crop is less competitive with weeds."

Effects of 3 tillage methods and 3 compaction treatments on the physical properties of a clayey soil were investigated in the lakebed region of northwestern Ohio. Tillage treatments included no-till (NT), chisel plowing (CP), and moldboard plowing (MP). Compaction treatments were imposed for 3 consecutive years followed by 4 years without compaction. Compaction treatments involved control, 10 Mg, and 20 Mg axle load on single axis. Effects of tillage las main plots) and axle load (as sub-plots) treatments were evaluated for 2 crop rotations: a 3-year rotation involving corn (Zea mays)-soybean (Glycine max)-oats (Avena sativa) and a 2-year rotation involving corn-soybean. These experiments were initiated in fall 1987, and measurements of soil physical properties were made in 1992 and 1993. Neither tillage nor compaction treatments had a significant effect on soil bulk density (rho(b)), and mean rho(b) measured in 1993 was 1.34 Mg m(-3) for 0 to 10 cm depth and 1.39 Mg m(-3) for 10 to 20 cm depth. Although not significantly different, trends in rho(b) were NT > MP > CP for 0 to 10 cm depth and NT > CP > MP for 10 to 20 cm depth. The data on saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-S) were highly variable and treatments had no effect. Moisture retention characteristics differed significantly among depths but not among treatments. The data highlight the need for development of suitable indices for or to assess management-induced differences in physical properties of clayey soils characterized by high swell-shrink capacity.

The silvicultural practices for poplar plantation on marginal soils beyond its established geographical limits were investigated between 1985 and 1995. The investigations included trials for evaluation of suitable clones, optimum spacing, irrigation and fertilizer requirement and inter-cropping studies. The performance of indigenous poplar clones was better than exotic clones. The spacing of 5 x 4 m (wider in North-South) produced the highest volume. Irrigation was very critical in summer months and 12-14 irrigations per year were required for good growth of trees. Poplars responded to application of nitrogen (160 kg ha(-1)) and phosphorus (100 kg ha(-1)) fertilizers. Intercropping with German chamomile resulted in maximum net return and wheat produced the highest increment in poplar diameter. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The effects of these agronomic practices on carabid beetle species composition were measured by pitfall-trap collections during three years. Although neither the number of individuals or number of species were significantly affected by treatments, analyses of variance indicated that four of the six dominant species (75.7% of the total number of carabids captured in three years) responded to tillage treatments. Harpalus pensylvanicus DeGeer and Cyclotrachelus sodalis (LeConte) were more abundant in no-tillage plots, whereas Pterostichus chalcites Say and Scarites substriatus Haldeman were more common in conventional tillage plots. Pterostichus chalcites was also significantly more abundant in soybean plots than in intercropping or com plots. H. pensylvanicus, a primarily herbivorous carabid, was the most common species collected. However, P. chalcites, a predaceous carabid, was the dominant species in soybean/conventional tillage plots. The results suggest that characteristics of individual species should be carefully considered for studies of communities such as carabid beetles, which have few strongly dominant species and a wide range of resource utilization.

Different management options like, alteration in planting time, more water efficient planting methods, tillage practices, irrigation management, intercropping, use of anti-transpirants, row orientation, planting geometry and application of mulches and shelter belts can play important role for sustainability of water resources and crop productivity.

However, the combined effect of more than one stimulus has rarely been tested. Here we show that the combination of two stimuli has a synergistic effect that controls herbivore damage and increases potato yield, despite the fact that each stimulus alone has no effect. A main potato pest in Colombia is the Guatemalan potato moth (Tecia solanivora) whose larvae specialize on potato tubers. To control this pest we tested the oviposition interference (repellence) of eight aromatic plants and the oviposition stimuli (attractiveness) of eight potato varieties. In the field we tested the effectiveness of the single and combined use of repellent and attractive stimuli on herbivore damage and tuber production of potato plants and compared the efficacy of these treatments to conventional management systems that employed insecticides. Although there was no effect of the attractive and repellent stimuli in the field when used alone, the combined use reduced the number of damaged tubers and increased the weight of undamaged tubers relative to the untreated plots, thus demonstrating a synergistic effect. Productivity in the conventionally treated plots was similar to plots treated with the combined stimuli. We demonstrate that the simultaneous use of garlic-pepper extracts and intercropping with S. tuberosum cv Roja Narino are an effective strategy for the management of T solanivora. This strategy maintains the productivity attained with conventional management practices, but without the health, environmental and ecological costs associated with the use of insecticides.

The expression of Cry toxins in transgenic crops has contributed to an efficient control of insect pests, leading to a significant reduction in chemical insecticide usage. Helicoverpa armigera is a Lepidopteran pest that feeds on a wide range of plants like cotton and cassava. In the present study, transgenic cassava plants over-expressing Cry1Aa, which we named as Bt cassava, were developed and used to evaluate its efficacy against H. armigera as a model. Insect feeding assays were carried out to test the effects of Bt cassava leaves on the development and survival of H. armigera. Significant reduction (P < 0.05) in the survival and weight were detected on larvae fed with Bt cassava leaves in comparison with those fed with wild-type cassava leaves. The higher expression of Cry1Aa in transgenic cassava caused the lethal effect in larvae, in contrast to the normal growth and development of adults and pupation observed when fed with wild-type leaves. Morphological observation on the larval midguts showed that the consumption of Bt cassava affected the gut integrity of H. armigera. The columnar cells of the midgut epithelium were dramatically damaged and showed loose or disordered structure. Their cytoplasms become highly vacuolated and contained disorganized microvilli. Our study demonstrated that the transgenic cassava expressing the Cry1Aa is effective in controlling H. armigera. Our Bt transgenic cassava plant would provide a long-term beneficial effect on all crops in intercropping system, which in-turn, will be profitable to the farmers.

The increased forage biomass production, mainly contributed by agrochemicals inputs in China, is accompanied by tremendous impacts on the ecology of dairy farms and soil quality. This paper presents a framework for healthy dairy farms in which targeted management practices are applied for quality milk products with minimal adverse environmental impacts. The paper also summarizes biodiversity management practices at the field and landscape scales toward lessening inputs of water, fertilizers, pesticides and mitigating soil compaction. Dairy farming with biodiversity-driven technologies and solutions will be more productive in producing quality milk and minimizing environmental damage. (C) The Author(s) 2022.

Effect of diammonium phosphate application on strigolactone production and Striga hermonthica infection in three sorghum cultivars	WEED RESEARCH			English	Article						"strigolactones; purple witchweed; diammonium hydrogen phosphate; Sorghum bicolor"	"ROOT PARASITIC PLANTS; ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; GERMINATION STIMULANTS; NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION; PEARL-MILLET; GRAIN-YIELD; INFESTATION; BICOLOR; GROWTH; MAIZE"	Jamil M, Van Mourik TA, Charnikhova T & Bouwmeester HJ (2012). Effect of diammonium phosphate application on strigolactone production and Striga hermonthica infection in three sorghum cultivars. Weed Research. Summary Striga hermonthica infection poses a major constraint to sorghum production in sub-Saharan Africa, and low soil fertility aggravates the S.hermonthica problem. Under mineral nutrient deficiency, the sorghum host secretes large quantities of strigolactones, signalling molecules, into the rhizosphere. These induce S.hermonthica seed germination and subsequent infection of the host roots. In a combination of field and glasshouse experiments, we analysed the effect of microdose applied diammonium hydrogen phosphate (DAP) fertiliser on production of strigolactones, S.hermonthica infection and yield of three different African sorghum genotypes (CGM-19/1-1, Lina-3, DouaG). The sorghum cultivars all produced the strigolactones sorgomol and 5-deoxystrigol, albeit in different quantity and ratio. Without fertiliser, high S.hermonthica infection and emergence occurred under both glasshouse and field conditions. DAP application reduced secretion of sorgomol and 5-deoxystrigol and reduced S.hermonthica germination (6670%), emergence (4973%) and dry biomass (9096%) under glasshouse conditions. Under field conditions, DAP microdosing reduced S.hermonthica emergence by 4084% and increased sorghum grain yield by 47142%. Thus DAP application reduced secretion of strigolactones into the rhizosphere and S.hermonthica parasitism both under controlled and field conditions. Microdosing of DAP may prove to be an efficient and cost effective option to reduce S.hermonthica damage in sorghum in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in combination with other control options, such as intercropping, use of organic fertiliser and hand pulling of S.hermonthica at flowering to achieve integrated S.hermonthica management.

"BACKGROUND Tea is an important economic crop in China. Mulching, a modern agricultural practice, can modify the soil microenvironment and maintain the crop yield. RESULTS To investigate the effect of different mulching modes on tea plant growth, filed experiments were conducted in a Shizipu tea plantation located in Langxi Country (Xuanchen City, Anhui Province, China). Five treatments were carried out in a randomized complete block arrangement: (i) clean tillage (control); (ii) black plastic film; (iii) weed barrier fabric; (iv) rice straw mulch; and (v) intercropping withVulpia myuros. The effects of different mulch modes on soil temperature, water moisture, soil compactness, root activity, soil enzyme activity and nutrition status on tea yield, quality and economic benefits were compared at the harvest stage. In the present study, compared with other mulch treatments, intercropping withV. myurossignificantly reduced the topsoil temperature (to an optimum temperature) and soil compactness, and increased the water holding capacity in the deep soil layer, which contributed to increased tea root activity and respiration. Furthermore, intercropping withV. myurossignificantly increased soil enzymes activity, soil organic matter, and the available nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the main root zone. Therefore, the stronger tea root activity accelerated nutrition uptake and increased the tea yield and quality-related components of the tea, thus resulting in a larger average net income. CONCLUSION Intercropping withV. myuroscould serve as a profitable agricultural method for tea production.

In addition, this work pretended to reach evidences of intraguild predation among the predators. The interplanting crops were canola (Brassica napus), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), hairy vetch (Vicia villosa) and sanfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia). Density values were given as average number of individuals in 30 linear meters (i/30m). Density was also evaluated in cotton plots under different treatments to control pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiela), which were applied in plots without interplanting crops. The interplanted crops promoted high densities of predators and a significant migration toward the intercropped cotton. Geocoris spp. showed its highest density in hairy vetch, with a gradual increment towards the final sampling date on both nymph and adult stages. Nabis spp. also showed its highest abundance in hairy vetch, as nymph at the beginning of the season, and as adult in the middle of the season, decreasing its density subsequently in all crops, but its density in the second half of the season was statistically higher in alfalfa and sanfoin. Orius spp. had its highest density in alfalfa during the whole season, except in the last sampling date, when it was higher in the intercropped cotton. A significant reduction of Orius spp. in relation to an increment of Geocoris spp., and other results, provide signs of intraguild predation from Geocoris spp. to Orius spp. and probably to Nabis spp. The treatment including chemical insecticide in cotton showed the lowest averages.

Biochar application with N-fixing legumes offers promise for increasing soil N retention and input. Strategic, low application rates (112 kg ha(-1)) of pine and coconut feedstock biochars were tested in an established alfalfa (Medicago sativa) field. Soil inorganic N and plant growth, N concentrations, and delta N-15 were monitored over a growing season to follow mineral N availability, and plant N uptake and sourcing. Microbial and gene abundance and enzyme activity were measured to assess the potential for N cycling processes to occur. Biochar application had minimal effects on measured parameters. However, significant temporal dynamics in N cycling and correlations between alfalfa delta N-15 and soil N availability indicate differing plant N sourcing over time. Our findings indicate that low application rates of biochar in established alfalfa fields do not significantly affect N cycling, and that managing alfalfa to maximize N fixation, for example by intercropping, may be a better solution to increase N stocks and retention in this system. To determine when biochar can be beneficial for alfalfa N cycling, we need additional research to assess various economically-feasible biochar application rates at different alfalfa growth stages.

Many studies highlight the impacts of plant diversification upon pathogens, and the population dynamics of insects and beneficial organism in agricultural ecosystems. These studies provide evidence that habitat manipulation techniques such as intercropping, relay, and rotation can significantly improve disease and pest management. This review introduces the concept of crop diversity, considers recent insights and mechanisms underlying crop diversity, and discusses its potential for improving sustainable agricultural practices. Recently, the phytobiomes resulting from increased crop diversity are increasingly recognized for their contribution to disease and pest control. Further, understanding the interactions between pathogens or pests with their host phytobiome may lead to novel options for the prevention of pests. Recent advances in the agricultural systems include: (i) a better understanding of the mechanisms of interactions between crop species and genotypes; (ii) ecological progress including a better understanding of the context-dependency of those interactions; and (iii) the role of microtopographic variation in agricultural systems for priming basal resistance to multiple pests and pathogens by intercropped crops.

We propose a method for formalizing the process of innovating cropping system prototype design using a tool called PRACT (Prototyping Rotation and Association with Cover crop and no Till) applied to a Malagasy case study. The input information for PRACT is comprised of: (i) crop and cover crop adaptation to biophysical conditions, (ii) agroecological functions of the cover crops, (iii) crop production, (iv) association possibilities between crop and cover crop, and (v) agroecological functions of the cropping system. All the information was derived from expert knowledge developed over more than 12 years of agronomic experiments in Madagascar. The final output from PRACT is a list of cropping systems, i.e., crop and cover crop associations and their sequences over three years. These cropping systems are characterized by their potential agroecological functions and crop production. The PRACT model selects a list of cropping systems taking into account the above information by using elaborate rules governing the intercropping and sequences between crops and cover crops. Examples of the outcomes of model simulations are provided for four different kinds of field. Taking into account the range of potential crops and cover crops, the number of cropping systems that was theoretically possible for the different field types ranged from 19,683 to 2.98 x 10(13). In a first step, PRACT reduced this number by a factor of up to 28 times to propose possible cropping systems. To do so, cropping systems are selected in terms of the biophysical requirements of plants, plant compatibility and agronomic rules. Not all of these systems are suitable for every farmer. Thus using PRACT output, a second cropping system selection step can be taken based on these cropping system characteristics, i.e., crop production and agroecological functions. By doing so the number of cropping systems selected can reach a reasonable value that can be handled by technicians and farmers. Possible uses and further development of the tool are discussed.

In response to China's blue skies protection campaign, effective NH3 reduction measures need to consider both mitigation efficiency and food security. In this context, we conducted a meta-analysis (including 2980 observations from 447 studies) to select effective measures based on absolute (AV) and yield-scaled (YSAV) NH3 volatilization reduction potential, with the aim of establishing a comprehensive NH3 mitigation framework covering various crop production sectors, and offering a range of potential solutions. The results showed that manipulating crop density, using an intermittent irrigation regime for paddy field rice, applying N as split applications or partially substituting inorganic fertilizer N with organic N sources could achieve reductions in AV and YSAV reduction of 10-20 %; adopting drip irrigation regimes, adding water surface barrier films to paddy fields, or using double inhibitor (urease and nitrification), slow-release or biofertilizers could achieve 20-40 % mitigation; plastic film mulching, applying fertilizer by irrigation or using controlled-release fertilizers could yield 40-60 % reduction; use of a urease inhibitor, fully substituting fertilizer N with organic N, or applying fertilizer by deep placement could decrease AV and YSAV by over 60 %. In addition, use of soil amendments, applying suitable inorganic N sources, or adopting crop rotation, intercropping or a rice-fish production model all had significant benefits to control AV. The adoption of any particular strategy should consider local accessibility and affordability, direct intervention by local/government authorities and demonstration to encourage the uptake of technologies and practices, particularly in NH3 pollution hotspot areas. Together, this could ensure food security and environmental sustainability."

Using three diverse cropping systems studies (Site 1, long-term cotton [Gossypium hirsutum L.]-cover crop systems; Site 2, short-term cotton-cover crop systems; and Site 3, transitional organic wheat [Triticum aestivum L.] system), our research objective was to quantify and compare BNF and associated parameters among four cool-season legumes (Austrian winter pea [Pisum sativum subsp. Arvense], hairy vetch [Vicia villosa], crimson clover [Trifolium incarnatum], and lentil [Lens culinaris]) in different settings. At Sites 1 and 2, winter pea had growth of 2.73 to 3.44 Mg ha(-1), the greatest percent N derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa; 57.2-72.6%) and, depending on site, the greatest level of BNF (67-74 kg N ha(-1)). Results from the organic system (Site 3) demonstrated winter pea was also productive in growth and BNF when intercropped with wheat in N-poor soil, with exceptionally high %Ndfa (92.7%). Hairy vetch and lentil differed in growth and %Ndfa, but had comparable BNF (46-51 kg N ha(-1)) at Sites 1 and 2. Growth of crimson clover was poor. This data provides insights on how cool-season legumes differ in BNF in the TRP in a year when legume growth was average for the region. The TRP has a volatile climate, however, indicating further study is needed to fully understand the BNF benefit cool-season legumes can provide in the region."

Studies using cover crops without the application of pesticides and soluble mineral fertilizers in no-tillage systems are important to reduce production costs, the need for mechanization, and to improve nutrient cycling and crop yield. The study aimed to evaluate how the use of different cover crops and the amount of dry matter produced by such species affect soil chemical properties and onion yield. Onion crops were grown for eight years without the use of pesticides and soluble mineral fertilizers in no-tillage system. The experiment was conducted from 2009 to 2016 in Ituporanga, state of Santa Catarina (SC), Brazil. The following treatments were used: barley (2010)/black oat, rye, oilseed radish, oilseed radish + rye, and oilseed radish + barley or black oat, and a control (consisting of weed species). A randomized block experimental design was used with eight replications. Plants from each treatment were collected 100 days after sowing in plot areas of 0.75 m2 to determine dry matter yield. The cover crops were desiccated and the onion seedlings were transplanted in July. The onion crops were harvested every November to evaluate yield. Soil samples were collected at depths of 0-10 and 10-20 cm after the onion harvest to evaluate soil chemical properties. The onion crop and residue deposition of single or intercropped black oat, rye, and oilseed radish improved and maintained soil chemical properties. The lower dry matter yield of cover crops found in the control treatment resulted in lower onion yields over the years. Cover crops combined with soil tillage limited to the planting rows increased total onion yields and yield of larger-sized onions as the system stabilized over time.

Mono-cropping systems also have a negative impact on forage yield and nutrition as cereals are deficient in protein. Hence, there is a dire need to grow cereals with legumes to improve forage yield and quality. Therefore, a two-year field study was undertaken to evaluate winter cereal-legume forage and their mixtures viz. oats (cv. PD2-LV65), barley (Jau-86) and one legume viz. vetch (cv. Languedock) under different tillage systems viz. conventional tillage (moldboard plow+4-cultivation with tines) and conservation tillage (3-cultivation with tines). Crops were grown in pure stands as well as in mixtures with a 70:30 seeding ratio. The results revealed that the conventional tillage system performed better in terms of numbers of tillers/branches, leaf-to-stem ratio and green fodder yield than the conservation tillage system. However, the conventional and conservation tillage systems did not show a significant difference in terms of crude protein, acid detergent fiber and neutral detergent fiber. In the pure stands and cereal-legume mixtures, the oat-vetch mixture performed better in terms of plant height, leaf-to-stem ratio and green fodder yield. The maximum crude protein content was observed in the oat-vetch mixture, while the maximum acid detergent fiber and neutral detergent fiber were observed in the pure oat stands. In competitive indices, the land-equivalent ratio and competitive ratio showed the advantage of intercropping. In actual yield loss, results showed the positive value of barley and oats in mixtures, which reflects the advantage of intercropping in the rainfed areas. The economic analysis showed a greater net benefit from the conventional tillage than the conservation tillage system under rainfed conditions. On the basis of this investigation, an oat-vetch mixture and the conventional tillage system are recommended for higher tonnage of nutritious fodder in rainfed areas.

However, tea green leafhoppers and thrips are key pests in Asian tea production systems, causing serious damage to its yield and quality. With growing concerns about pesticide residues on tea and their adverse effects on natural enemies of tea pests, biological pest control is gaining more importance in tea plantations. Orius sauteri is a polyphagous predator used as a biological control agent. Here, we reported 11 plants as banker plants to support the predatory Orius sauteri in tea plant systems. Among them, white clover, red bean, mung bean, peanut, soybean, kidney bean, bush vetch, smooth vetch, and common vetch were found suitable; red bean performed relatively better than the others. Tea green leafhoppers and thrips are key pests in tea plantations and have widely invaded those of Asian origin. Pesticides are currently a favorable control method but not desirable for frequent use on tea plants. To meet Integrated Pest Management (IPM) demand, biological control with a natural enemy is viewed as the most promising way. Orius sauteri are slated to be a natural enemy to tea pests. However, more knowledge of rearing O. sauteri and selecting banker plant systems is strongly needed. The reproductive biology evaluation of the egg oviposition and population life parameters of O. sauteri under laboratory conditions were examined, and the supporting ability of 11 plant species-motherwort, white clover, red bean, mung bean, peanut, soybean, kidney bean, herba violae, bush vetch, smooth vetch, and common vetch-in a greenhouse was assessed. Most of the selected plants, except for herba violae, performed relatively well with high oviposition quantity and survival. The mean fecundity per female on red bean and motherwort was 148.75 eggs and 148.25 eggs, respectively, and 90.20 eggs for tea plants (the smallest); there also were significant differences. In an experiment to determine the life parameters of O. sauteri, all the tested plants, except herba violae, were found to be able to complete the growth and development of the life cycle; there also were significant differences. The intrinsic rate of increase of motherwort and red bean was 1.18 and 1.17, respectively, and higher compared to that of the other plants, including tea plants (1.13). This result of the O. sauteri population development index was also confirmed in a greenhouse with the number of motherwort and red beans being as high as 113.33 and 112.67. Since motherwort was found to be susceptible to aphids and powdery mildew in each trial, it cannot be used for intercropping in tea gardens. Among the 11 plants, red bean was found to be the most suitable to support O. sauteri in tea plantations."

In the first experiment, under split plot design a summer fallow treatment was compared with four different cover crops including mung bean (Phaseolus radiatus L.), huai bean (Glycine ussuriensis Regel et Maack), hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), and rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) under varying cover cropping patterns (crop rotation and crop relay intercropping). The second experiment was conducted with RCDB design to investigate four different cover crops (Huai bean, mung bean, hairy vetch and rapeseed) and four planting densities (75, 100, 125 and 150% of the recommended planting density). The results revealed that mung bean, huai bean and hairy vetch at 150% of planting density produced the highest biomass, while the rapeseed at 75% planting densities yielded higher biomass compared to the local recommended rate. Moreover, huai bean and rapeseed rotation resulted in higher contents of soil organic matter, total and mineral N, available P and K contents in comparison to the fallow treatment. Thus, Huai bean and rapeseed wheat rotations are effective strategies in order to improve crops productivity and soil quality in the Loess Plateau of China.

We hypothesized that plant species and mixture (intercropping) would induce different short-term legacy effects impacting carbon and nitrogen-related soil microbial activities and resistance and resilience after a heat disturbance. A microcosm experiment was conducted using a calcareous Mediterranean soil conditioned by a complete vegetative cycle in a greenhouse with four planting modalities (W = monoculture of Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.); L = monoculture of white Lupin (Lupines albus L.); WL = both species intercropped; U = unplanted soil). Half of microcosms were incubated at 28 degrees C (C = control conditions) whereas the remaining half were exposed at 48 degrees C for 2 days (S = stress conditions), with an immediately return to control conditions. Microcosms were destructively sampled at 2, 7, 16 and 28 days (T2, T7, T16, T28) after the end of the heat disturbance and the following soil measurements were performed: Basal Respiration (BR), Substrate-Induced Respiration (SIR), Nitrification Enzyme Activity (NEA) and N mineral concentrations. Our results demonstrated that monocultures and intercropping promoted different legacy effects under control conditions especially for SIR. WL soils presented lower values of SIR than L and higher than W soils. For SIR, W and WL soils conferred greater resistance to the heat stress, whereas L and WL soils conferred higher resilience at T28. For NEA, no differences between soils were observed for resistance to heat stress, but at T16, soils having WL legacy were more resilient than L soils, but comparable to those having W legacy. Our results highlight that a short-term legacy effect is measurable but greatly differs between C- and N-related microbial activities. We estimated that intercropping had modified ability of soil microorganisms to face heat stress, suggesting that plant legacy effect has to be considered to mitigate extreme climatic events in Mediterranean soils."

Lime and gypsum combination improves crop and forage yields and estimated meat production and revenue in a variable charge tropical soil	NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						"Soil acidity; Soil amendment; Integrated crop-livestock system; Grain yield; Profitability"	"PHOSPHOGYPSUM SURFACE APPLICATION; ORGANIC-MATTER POOLS; NO-TILL; LIVESTOCK SYSTEM; GRAIN-YIELD; USE EFFICIENCY; CORN; NUTRITION; ACIDITY; LONG"	"In tropical integrated crop-livestock under no-till (NT) systems, the surface application/reapplication of lime and/or gypsum can reduce re-acidification rate of the soil and improve plant nutrition, crop yields, and profitability. This study was conducted in the Brazilian Cerrado, which has dry winters, and aimed to evaluate the effects of surface application/reapplication of lime and/or gypsum on soil improvement, plant nutrition and crop yield improvement, as well as the forage dry matter (DM) yield, estimated meat production, and economic results. The crop rotation used between November 2004 and August 2008 was as follows: peanut (Arachis hypogaea) and white oat (Avena sativa) cultivated alone (on the first and second spring/summer and autumn/winter, respectively) and corn (Zea mays) intercropped with palisade grass [Urochloa brizantha cv. 'Marandu'] and pasture (on the third and fourth spring/summer and autumn/winter, respectively). The experimental design was a randomized block with four replications. The treatments consisted of natural conditions of a sandy clay loam kaolinitic and thermic Typic Haplorthox (control) and the surface application of lime and/or gypsum in October 2002 and reapplication in November 2004. Surface liming was an efficient practice for increasing pH and reducing the exchangeable acidity (H + Al) and concentration of Al extending to a depth of 0.60 m. Gypsum application increased Ca2+ levels through the soil profile. Liming (with or without gypsum) had a positive effect on the nutrient acquisition by peanut, white oat, and corn crops, producing on average 48%, 52%, and 61% more pod and grain yield, respectively, than that obtained in the absence of soil amendments and with gypsum alone. The surface application of lime + gypsum also promoted forage DM yield of corn-palisade grass intercropping 22% higher than lime application and 164% higher than control; estimated meat production 26% higher than lime application and 225% higher than control, and increased economic results during four growing seasons. The surface application of lime + gypsum is an essential tool for food production in NT tropical agriculture with high soil acidity."	"[Crusciol, Carlos A.

Impact of land use during winter on the balance of greenhouse gases	SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						"Bare fallow; carbon dioxide (CO2); eddy covariance; nitrous oxide (N2O); winter crop"	"NITROUS-OXIDE EMISSIONS; COVER CROPS; EDDY COVARIANCE; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; FALLOW PERIODS; MANAGEMENT; FIELDS; AGRICULTURE; CHAMBER; FLUXES"	The increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) can be mitigated by capturing CO2 from the atmosphere and/or by reducing their emissions. Replacing winter intercrop fallow by cover crops (CCs) can sequester carbon and improve nitrogen use efficiency under proper management. We monitored two cycles of a cash crop namely soybean (soy1) and double-cropping soybean (soy2) and their respective post-harvest periods. During the first period, a winter crop (wheat) was used as an alternative to CCs, and in the second period, a chemical fallow treatment (bare soil) was applied. Carbon dioxide and N2O exchange rates were estimated with turbulent flux measurements and N2O fluxes with complementary static chambers. During the soy1/wheat sequence, the soil gained 2800 kg C eq/ha, while during the soy2/bare fallow sequence the soil lost 5083 kg C eq/ha. Excluding the carbon exported by harvest, both sequences lost carbon, but the soy2/bare fallow cycle was fivefold higher. The replacement of bare fallow by a winter cover crop like wheat decreases N2O emissions considerably and converts carbon losses (by respiration) into gains (by fixation in photosynthesis). The replacement of traditional non-harvested cover crops by winter wheat may provide not only similar advantages in terms of soil improvement, preservation, and reduction in nitrogen loss, but also an additional harvest.

"Soil cracks can enhance water recharge through preferential flow during the rainy season and enhanced evaporation loss during the post-rainy season. Despite their significance, a limited information is available on the management of surface cracks in Vertisols. The frequency, size, and rate of development of cracks greatly affect the movement of soil water and nutrient and exchange of gases in the soil profile and also influence plant growth processes in Vertisols. To find out the suitable soil amendments and land use for reducing the rate of crack formation in medium-deep black soils of the region, a 4-year field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of different soil amendments and land uses on surface cracks, soil properties and crop yields on Vertisols under semiarid conditions. Field experiment consisted of three different land uses [i.e., agriculture [intercropping of sorghum (Sorghum biocolor L.)+pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L.) at 1:1 ratio], grassland (dhaman grassCenchrus ciliaris L.), fallow land (no cultivation fallow)] as main plots with four different soil amendments [i.e., S0control, S1fly ash @ 10Mgha(-1), S2crop residue (wheat straw) @ 5Mgha(-1), S3gypsum (100% of gypsum requirement), S4FYM @ 5Mgha(-1)] as subplots. The data showed that application of soil amendments had a beneficial effect on soil properties such soil pH, available nutrients, labile C and total organic carbon and stocks. In the 0-15-cm layer, SOC stocks varied from 15.17 to 20.04; 16.13-20.67; 14.25-19.58Mgha(-1) for agriculture, grassland and fallow land, respectively. The labile C and total organic carbon contents were in the order of grassland>agriculture>fallow land. Further, soil under grassland system recorded the higher mean weight diameter than that under crop and fallow land. Among different soil amendments applied, wheat straw and FYM had a significant effect (P<0.05) on soil aggregation. Application of amendments increased soil moisture content by 5.7-12.6; 2.2-13.3; 9.0-17.3% over control (no soil amendments) for agriculture, grassland and fallow land use system, respectively. Among different land uses, crack volume reduction was in the order of grassland (-7 to -44%)>agriculture (-7 to -18%)>fallow land (-2 to -23%). Wheat straw application registered the lowest crack volume followed by that under FYM, fly ash and gypsum, regardless of the land use systems. Crop and grass biomass yields were significantly (P<0.05) affected by the application of soil amendments. Application soil amendments not only reduced crack volume but also favorably influenced soil properties and crop yields in Vertisols."	"[Somasundaram, J.; Singh, R. K.; Prasad, S.

In the last decades stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses on archaeobotanical cereal remains have been developed in order to reconstruct water and nutrient sources for grain filling. Diachronic studies on isotope records from single archaeological sites may help distinguish palaeoclimatic changes from human choices in agricultural practices, but they are actually missing. We have analysed C-13 isotope discrimination (Delta C-13) and N isotope composition (delta N-15) on barley, emmer and wheat C-14-AMS dated grains from the archaeological site of Arslantepe, Malatya (South-Eastern Turkey). Our intent is to focus on the exceptionally long-term development of agricultural practices at the site from 4300 to 2000 BC. Stable isotope values of cereals show temporal trends in water supplies and manure application. Irrigation was provided to barley crops from 4300 to 3100 BC during the rise of centralised political organisation at the site. Different locations of barley fields are suggested from 3100 to 2000 BC when domestic economies are attested. In addition, the marked increase of barley delta N-15 values from 3350 to 3000 BC reveals manuring and/or cultivation in pasturelands due to the deposition of animal urea and dung. Wheat could have been grown close to the site, where irrigation water from natural springs was available. Emmer and wheat seem to have been cultivated in the same areas or directly in the same fields. During 3000-2500 BC intercropping cultivation is inferred by low delta N-15 values. The evidence of mixture crops confirms the increase of pasturelands during herders' occupations and the concentration of crop fields possibly around the site. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Quantitative characterization of five cover crop species	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article							"NITROGEN CATCH CROPS; GREEN MANURES; SOIL-EROSION; RESIDUES; WINTER; GROWTH; CARBON; SPAIN; DECOMPOSITION; SUPPRESSION"	The introduction of cover crops in the intercrop period may provide a broad range of ecosystem services derived from the multiple functions they can perform, such as erosion control, recycling of nutrients or forage source. However, the achievement of these services in a particular agrosystem is not always required at the same time or to the same degree. Thus, species selection and definition of targeted objectives is critical when growing cover crops. The goal of the current work was to describe the traits that determine the suitability of five species (barley, rye, triticale, mustard and vetch) for cover cropping. A field trial was established during two seasons (October to April) in Madrid (central Spain). Ground cover and biomass were monitored at regular intervals during each growing season. A Gompertz model characterized ground cover until the decay observed after frosts, while biomass was fitted to Gompertz, logistic and linear-exponential equations. At the end of the experiment, carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and fibre (neutral detergent, acid and lignin) contents, and the N fixed by the legume were determined. The grasses reached the highest ground cover (83-99%) and biomass (1226-1928 g/m(2)) at the end of the experiment. With the highest C:N ratio (27-39) and dietary fibre (527-600 mg/g) and the lowest residue quality (similar to 680 mg/g), grasses were suitable for erosion control, catch crop and fodder. The vetch presented the lowest N uptake (24 and 07 g N/m(2)) due to N fixation (98 and 16 g N/m(2)) and low biomass accumulation. The mustard presented high N uptake in the warm year and could act as a catch crop, but low fodder capability in both years. The thermal time before reaching 30% ground cover was a good indicator of early coverage species. Variable quantification allowed finding variability among the species and provided information for further decisions involving cover crop selection and management.	"[Ramirez-Garcia, J.; Gabriel, J.

Treatments consisted of four simulated rainfall tests at different times, with a planned intensity of 64 mm h(-1) and 90 min duration. The first test was applied 18 days after sowing, and the others at 39, 75 and 120 days after the first test. Different times of the simulated rainfall and stages of the crop cycle affected soil water content prior to the rain, and the time runoff began and its peak flow and, thus, the surface hydrological processes. The depth of the runoff and the depth of the water intercepted by the crop + soil infiltration + soil surface storage were affected by the crop systems and the rainfall applied at different times. The corn crop was the most effective treatment for controlling runoff, with a water loss ratio of 0.38, equivalent to 75 % of the water loss ratio exhibited by common bean (0.51), the least effective treatment in relation to the others. Total water loss by runoff decreased linearly with an increase in the time that runoff began, regardless of the treatment; however, soil water content on the gravimetric basis increased linearly from the beginning to the end of the rainfall."

Our objective was to generate information on Sclerotium rolfsii dynamics under different crop or intercrop activities, and design and test a research approach where simple experiments and the use of models are combined to explore crop sequences that minimize Southern blight incidence. The effect of seventeen green manure (GM) amendments on sclerotia dynamics was analyzed in greenhouse and field plot experiments during two years. The relative densities of viable sclerotia 90 days after winter GM (WGM) incorporation were generally lower than after summer GM (SGM) incorporation, with average recovery values of 60% and 61% for WGM in the field, 66% and 43% for WGM in the greenhouse, and 162% to 91% for SGM in the greenhouse, in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Sclerotia survival on day d after GM amendment was described by the model S-f = S-t x exp(-b x d), relating initial (S-i) and final (S-f) sclerotia densities. Relative decay rates of the sclerotia (b) in SGM amended soil were largest for alfalfa (0.0077 +/- 0.0031 day(-1)) and sudangrass (0.0072 +/- 0.0030 day-1). In WGM amended soil, the largest b values were for oat (0.0096 +/- 0.0024 day(-1)), wheat (0.0090 +/- 0.0024 day(-1)) and alfalfa (0.0087 +/- 0.0023 day(-1)). The effect of three cropping sequences (sweet pepper-fallow, sweet pepper-black oat and sweet pepper-onion) on sclerotia dynamics was analyzed in microplot experiments, and the data were used to calibrate the model P-f = P-i/(alpha + beta P-i), relating initial (P-i) and final (P-f) sclerotia densities. Median values for the relative rate of population increase at low P-i (1/alpha, dimension less) and the asymptote (1/beta, number of viable sclerotia in 100 g of dry soil) were 8.22 and 4.17 for black oat (BO), 1.13 and 8.64 for onion (O), and 6.26 and 17.93 for sweet pepper (SwP). By concatenating the two models, sclerotia population dynamics under several crop sequences were simulated. At steady state, the sequence SwP-O-Fallow-BO resulted in the lowest long-term sclerotia density (7.09 sclerotia/100 g soil), and SwP-Fallow in the highest (17.89 sclerotia/100 g soil). The developed methodology facilitates the selection of a limited number of rotation options to be tested in farmers' fields. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The subplots were the years: 2008 and 2009. Determinations consisted of total organic C, labile and resistant C, total N, microbial biomass C and N, the C/N ratio of soil organic matter, and the microbial quotient (qMic), besides microbiological and biochemical attributes, assessed only in 2009. The attributes significantly changed with the winter crops, especially the multicropping of cover crops and fodder radish, as well as effect of years. Despite stimulating the microbiological/biochemical activity, fodder radish cropping decreased the soil C in the second year, likewise the wheat cropping. The multicropping of cover crops in winter is an option for management in the establishment of no-till system, which contributes to increase the concentrations of C and stimulate the soil microbiological/biochemical activity."

This experiment was set up in 2007 with the aim of evaluating the effect of different soil management systems and animal traffic on soil physical and water properties and soybean development and yield. The soil evaluated was a dystrofic Red Latosol (Oxisol) under a no-tillage grain crop system intercropped with forage for the past decade. The effect of animal traffic was evaluated in regard to soil bulk density (Bd), macroporosity (Ma), microporosity (Mi), total porosity (TP), soil resistance to penetration (RP) and soil moisture content (theta), as well as soybean emergence, height and yield. A randomized block experimental design was used with three replications, with the treatments of no-tillage soybean cropping without grazing (SD/SP), no-tillage cropping with grazing in oats (SD/CP) and chisel plowing with grazing (ESC/CP). Soil samples were collected in the 0.00 to 0.07 m, 0.07 to 0.15 m and 0.20 to 0.30 m layers at three time periods: before grazing (August 2007), after grazing (December 2007) and after grazing (October 2008). There was no significant effect of grazing on Bd and TP. At 140 days after sowing of soybean, RP reached values above 2 MPa in the 0.00 to 0.15 m layer in the treatments SD/SP and SD/CP, without limiting crop development. Chisel plowing of the soil in crop-livestock integration under the no-tillage system led to soil physical-water conditions less favorable to plant development. Plant height in the SD/SP was greater than in the treatments SD/CP and ESC/CP, and the lowest grain yield was obtained through chisel plowing of the soil in a year with water deficit.

Management strategies that deliberately include the native shrub Piliostigma reticulatum in Senegalese cropping systems result in soil functioning enhancement that benefits to the associated cereal. The objective of this work was to evaluate shrub effect on soil nematode communities. Soil samples were collected from an experimental design where pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) was cultivated alone or with P. reticulatum stands and mulch. Soil nematofauna characteristics were determined and compared with results from soil under pure shrub stands and from bare soil. The analysis of soil nematofauna, characterized by the abundance of different trophic groups and related indices (MI, maturity index; El and SI, enrichment and structure indices), allowed discrimination between treatments with or without shrub presence. The soil nematode community in millet cultivation was dominated by plant feeding nematodes, mainly from the Hoplolaimidae family, but their abundance decreased when P. reticulatum was associated to the cereal. The shrub also impacted other nematode trophic groups. The abundance of opportunistic bacterial feeders (mainly Cephalobidae) was increased in shrub treatments. Further research should explore consequences on cereal nutrition and nematicidal properties of P. reticulatum. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved."

We sought to inform development of a 2G crop portfolio by assessing the profitability of novel cropping systems that potentially mitigate the negative effects of grain-based biofuel crops on food supply and environmental quality. We analyzed farm-gate costs and returns of five systems from an ongoing experiment in central Iowa, USA. The continuous corn cropping system was most profitable under current market conditions, followed by a corn-soybean rotation that incorporated triticale as a 2G cover crop every third year, and a corn-switchgrass system. A novel triticale-hybrid aspen intercropping system had the highest yields over the long term, but could only surpass the profitability of the continuous corn system when biomass prices exceeded foreseeable market values. A triticale/sorghum double cropping system was deemed unviable. We perceive three ways 2G crops could become more cost competitive with grain crops: by (1) boosting yields through substantially greater investment in research and development, (2) increasing demand through substantially greater and sustained investment in new markets, and (3) developing new schemes to compensate farmers for environmental benefits associated with 2G crops.

The experimental design was a randomized block with four replications and six treatments: no weeded; spontaneous local vegetation cutting; usual mulch of Brachiaria decumbens (check) and three other treatments with cover crops Avena strigosa, Lathyrus sativus and Lupinus albus, from March to October, followed by Mucuna deeringiana from October to March. Productivity, the number and the weight of cluster of grape were evaluated. The medium values were compared by using the Duncan test at 5% of significance. According to the average of the years, the results of all characteristics observed in the treatments with the green cover were similar ou more favorable than those ones using mulch cover.

Root access to water and nutrients depends on soil physical characteristics that may be expressed in the Least Limiting Water Range (LLWR) concept. In this work, the effects of crop rotation and chiselling on the soil LLWR to a depth of 0.1 m and crop yields under no-till were studied on a tropical Alfisol in Sao Paulo state, Brazil, for 3 yr. Soybean and corn were grown in the summer in rotation with pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum, Linneu, cv. ADR 300), grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor, L., Moench), congo grass (Brachiaria ruziziensis, Germain et Evrard) and castor bean (Ricinus comunis, Linneu) during fall/winter and spring, under no-till or chiselling. The LLWR was determined right after the desiccation of the cover crops and before soybean planting. Soil physico-hydraulic conditions were improved in the uppermost soil layers by crop rotations under zero tillage, without initial chiselling, from the second year and on, resulting in soil quality similar to that obtained with chiselling. In seasons without severe water shortage, crop yields were not limited by soil compaction, however, in a drier season, the rotation with congo grass alone or intercropped with castor resulted in the greatest cover crop dry matter yield. Soybean yields did not respond to modifications in the LLWR.	"[Olibone, D.; Encide-Olibone, A. P.; Rosolem, C.

This country experienced high taxes of development in agribusiness, increasing exportation trading, producing foods of better quality and raising incoming rates of farmers. However, two mains aspects call the attention in respect to sustainability: excessive soil preparation with monoculture of annual crops and pasture degradation. These situations have brought losses in crop and livestock yields, increased soil degradation and collapse of natural resources. Continuous cropping of monoculture accelerates attacks of insects and diseases, specially the ones related to soil interactions. Technologies such as minimum tillage, crop rotation and crop-livestock integration can alleviate these problems and drive agriculture to sustainability. Minimum tillage has increase to more than 60% of soil tillage usage in Brazil. Adoption of this system in large scale, covering more regions, with different clime and soil, is highly dependent of crops that produce high amounts of residues and straw for better soil coverage. Crop-livestock integrated systems (CLIS) have been cultivated with many crops, such as: soybeans, corn, pearl millet, sorghum, cotton, sunflower, etc. and especially perennial tropical grasses as Brachiaria spp, intercropped or not. CLIS can be one important alternative to pasture recuperation and improvement of annual crops. They increase straw to minimum tillage systems, improve soil chemical, physical and biological properties, and better use of equipments, farmers income, and jobs in rural area. This paper analyze the state of the art in CLIS research, later results, and bring some considerations for the near the future of CLIS in Brazil.

Studies related to entomopathogenic organisms in stink bugs are interesting for their possibilities to be used as biological control agents and because they could be an etiological agent in mass rearing. We determined the prevalence of trypanosomatids in the most important species of the stink bug complex in soybean, from Brazil, Nezara viridula (L.), Euschistus heros (Fabricius) and Piezodorus guildinii (Westwood). Insects were collected in soybean and on alternate hosts during the intercrop season. Hemolymph drops from each adult were mounted on slides and observed under microscope; stink bug numbers with and without flagellates were recorded. The flagellates found in P guildinii or E. heros populations were smaller than that found in N. viridula. The higher prevalence of the trypanosomatids was observed on soybean reaching a peak of 30% of the sampled N. viridula specimens in January, 2001, and 44% prevalence in February 2003. The maximum prevalences (16%) in P guildinii were observed in January and February, 2003 and on July 27, 2003 with 20% of the specimens infected. Flagellates in the hemolymph of E. heros were less frequent (maximum prevalence of 8.7%), suggesting that this species is less susceptible than X viridula and P guildinii. Trypanosomatid prevalence was higher than that observed for entomopathogenic fungi, however they seem to be inefficient control agents in short term condition."

Retrospective perturbation analysis	WEED SCIENCE			English	Article						"life-table response experiment; simulation model; integrated weed management; seed predation; crop rotation; legume green manure"	"WEED MANAGEMENT; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; SEED PREDATION; GROWTH; FIELDS; GREEN; SOIL; CORN"	Cropping system characteristics affect weed management by altering key demographic rates of weeds, including recruitment, seedling survival, fecundity and seed survival. To facilitate the design and improvement of cropping systems that limit weed population growth, analytical methods are needed to identify weed management choke points (weed life stages that vary in response to management and whose variation strongly affects weed population growth rate). The objectives of this study were to (1) determine whether wheat-red clover green manure can limit giant foxtail population growth rate (lambda) in a wheat-corn-soybean crop sequence and (2) identify choke points in the giant foxtail life cycle with respect to the green manure treatment. Demographic data were used to construct a periodic matrix model of giant foxtail population growth in a wheat-corn-soybean crop sequence, with either a wheat sole crop (W) or a wheat-red clover intercrop (R) in the wheat phase. Identification of choke points was accomplished by adapting the life-table response experiment (LYRE) design for retrospective perturbation analysis of the periodic matrix model. The difference in lambda (Deltalambda) between the two treatments was decomposed into contributions from each parameter in each rotation phase of the periodic model. Each LTRE contribution was equal to the product of the sensitivity of lambda to changes in a given parameter by the treatment difference in that parameter. Those parameters making large contributions to Deltalambda represented weed management choke points. Giant foxtail population growth rate in the simulation was more than twice as great in the W treatment (lambda = 2.54) than in the R treatment (lambda = 1.16). Retrospective perturbation analysis indicated that the proportion of seeds surviving predation in the wheat phase made the largest LTRE contribution (0.55) to Deltalambda, followed by seedling recruitment in the soybean (0.41) and corn (0.20) phases. By identifying weed management choke points within a given system, retrospective perturbation analysis can target research and management efforts for greater reductions in weed population growth.

They must therefore be intensified in a sustainable manner. The present study was initiated in 1986 and continued until 1996 to evaluate the effects of phosphorus (P) fertilization, tillage and rotation with sole cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) on an operational scale with two cropping systems, namely, sole miller and millet-cowpea intercropping. A randomized complete block design with four replications was used. The effects of P fertilization, ridging with animal traction and planting on ridges (AT), and rotation with sole cowpea increased the productivity of miller substantially in 10 of the 11 years. Based on the 11-year average, P fertilization alone improved grain yield by 52%, and AT with P fertilization improved grain yield by nearly 135%. Combining AT, P fertilization and the sole cowpea rotation resulted in a 200% increase in grain yield compared with the traditional system of production. Miller productivity did not show a significant decline when intercropped with cowpea. Stability and relative stability analysis showed that the traditional system was more stable than the various agronomic packages, but had the least yield. Conversely the agronomic package with the highest yield advantage over the traditional system was the least stable. A major portion of the annual variation in the environmental index for grain yield and total dry matter was attributed to the seasonal variation in rainfall and organic matter depletion. Organic matter levels declined linearly with years of cultivation. Significant differences were found in the rare of depletion between the various agronomic treatments tested. After 11 years, nearly 60% of the organic matter was depleted irrespective of the agronomic treatments.

However, the average diet in the country is unbalanced, and suffers from a suboptimal provision of protein. The major task facing China's agriculture in the near future is to produce increased animal or other protein sources; animal production is currently constrained by the poor quality of the feed produced in the country. Priority for improving the nutritional content of human diets in China should be given to developing high quality feeds and raising feed conversion efficiency. Traditional cropping patterns in three regions of Shaanxi Province were described and potential adjustments to these systems identified that would increase the production of high quality animal feeds. Trials of these novel cropping systems were undertaken in each area and results were utilized to identify the practical advantages and disadvantages of novel systems, and as an input to linear programming models that estimated the overall effectiveness of reformed cropping pattern scenarios within the three regions. Results suggest that introduction of feed barley to the cropping system in paddy areas in Hanzhong Basin and extension of intercropping of corn with soybean (grain) within cropping system in the irrigated area in Guanzhong Plain were the most effective methods of developing fine quality feeds. In the rain-fed area in Weibei Highland an extension of perennial legume alfalfa and appropriate rotation of grain crops with forages proved most effective. The three regions are representative of the major agro-ecosystems in China, hence the results have important implications for the rest of the country."

Six Holstein cows, four lactating and two dry cows fitted with rumen cannulae, were used to evaluate consumption and milk yield in a Latin square design replicated with two treatments: a) ration with urea (sugar cane, cassava and urea) and b) C. cajan ration (sugar cane, cassava, C. cajan). Measurements of dry matter (DM) consumption, milk yield and components and bromatological value of the feeds, were studied. Both rations had the same DM consumption level, reaching 148 g/kg LW(0.75); fibre ingestion was higher (P < 0.05) with C. cajan and the crude protein was lower (P < 0.001) than with urea. Milk production was of 7.2 and 6.8 litres/cow/day for the rations with urea and C. cajan, respectively without differences between treatments; neither did they differ in milk components (fat, total solids and proteins). This result suggests that it is advantageous to use C. cajan as an alternative for supplementing natural protein through its inclusion in crop rotation and intercropping.

E. Smith, 1797). has become one of the most devastating pests in the world with diverse host range. To develop effective integrated management strategies against S. frugiperda it is crucial to know its alternative host plants. In this study, we provide the first information on the occurrence of S. frugiperda in onion crops in Africa. Monitoring was carried out during the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons in onion monoculture and in intercropping with groundnut to detect the presence and assess the incidence of S. frugiperda. The highest average incidence (2.88%) and larval density (0.79 per 9 m(2)) were observed in onion monoculture. The classification of the onion leaf damage rating scale indicated low S. frugiperda infestation. This suggests that future studies will need to assess this aspect which we consider to be a survival strategy to maintain its population throughout the year. which contributes to sustain the insect in the study area during times when its preferred hosts are not present. Furthermore, genetic studies are needed to provide a better explanation of the ecology of this pest and to find out which of the two existing strain infests onions or whether it is an unknown hybrid population of S. frugiperda.

There have been several studies about the impacts of continuous cropping on soil microbial, but few about differences between soil experiencing continuous cropping obstacles and those where such obstacles had been resisted. Here, after ten or twenty years of continuous tobacco cropping, we collected soil samples investigating discrepancies in soil property and bacterial community between soils experiencing continuous cropping obstacles and soils where the obstacles were resisted providing insight into preventing and controlling continuous cropping obstacles. Results showed that soil organic matter (SOM), available phosphorus (AP), total nitrogen (TN), nitrate-N (NO3--N), and bacterial diversity of samples where continuous cropping obstacles had been resisted were significantly higher than those where continuous cropping obstacles were present. Besides, SOM, AP, TN, and Ammonium-N (NH4+-N) considerably affected the bacterial community. Among all variables, NH4+-N explained the largest proportion of bacterial community variation. Molecular ecological networks were used to putatively identify keystone taxa, including Acidobacteria Gp1, Acidobacteria Gp2, Acidobacteria Gp16, and WPS-1_genera_incertae_sedis. Their relative abundance significantly changed between the two conditions. Overall, our results indicate that decreases in soil nutrient content and bacterial diversity, and significant changes in some keystone taxa abundances may be important factors leading to increased soil-borne diseases and reduced tobacco production potential or quality. Thus, during agricultural production, we could regulate the stability of the soil-crop-microbial ecological system via crop rotation, intercropping, or the use of specialized bio-fertilizers and soil conditioners to mitigate continuous cropping obstacles."

Plants have evolved strategies to respond to P limitation which affect N cycling in plant-soil systems. A comprehensive understanding of how plants with efficient P-acquisition or -use strategies influence carbon (C) and N cycling remains elusive. We highlight how P-acquisition/-use strategies, particularly the release of carboxylates into the rhizosphere, accelerate soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition and soil N mineralisation by destabilising aggregates and organic-mineral associations. We advocate studying the effects of P-acquisition/-use strategies on SOM formation, directly or through microbial turnover.

MIXTURE	TURKISH JOURNAL OF FIELD CROPS			English	Article						"Competition; intercropping; quality; second crop; yield"	"SPECIES INTERACTIONS; PEA MIXTURES; PLANT; OAT; BIOFERTILIZERS; GROWTH; CEREAL"	Intercropping used in modern agricultural systems is designed for growing more plant species in the same field for maximized growth parameters. This study was conducted to understand the effects of row seeding configuration (same, alternate and cross seeding row) and different Sudangrass ratios (25 and 50%) on yield, quality, and competitive ability of common vetch in second crop production. Among row seeding configuration, same row seeding maximized the aboveground biomass production but decreased belowground biomass, crude protein content and NDF (Neutral Detergent Fiber). Plant height, ratio, ADF (Acid Detergent Fiber) content, AGRNE (Aboveground Relative Neighbor Effect), and BGRNE (Belowground Relative Neighbor Effect) were not affected by row seeding configurations. In order to maximize the utilization from the row seeding configuration, the same row seeding can increase the aboveground biomass but mitigate belowground biomass and crude protein content. The row seeding configuration may represent a potential for yield, quality, and competitive ability when sown as a mixture using 25% Sudangrass ratio.

The objectives of this research were to (i) evaluate whether management practices are variety-specific for the establishment of switchgrass and (ii) assess the effectiveness of cover crops as preceding crops on 'Shawnee' switchgrass establishment. Therefore, two studies were conducted at the University of Massachusetts Agricultural Experiment Station in Deerfield, MA, USA, in the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 growing seasons. In Experiment 1, cover crop treatments (fallow, oat (Avena sativa L.) and rye (Secale cereale L.)) were the main plots, the two seeding methods (no-till drill and a cultipacker seeder (Brillion)) were the sub-plots, and the two varieties ('Cave-in-Rock' (CIR) and Shawnee)) were the sub-sub-plots. The second study was conducted using Shawnee switchgrass and involved the three cover crop treatments used in Experiment 1 using a cultipacker seeder with seed firming prior to planting but not afterwards (consistent in both experiments). The results indicated that a combination of oat and no-till resulted in higher tiller density (493%), lower weed biomass (77%), increased switchgrass biomass (SGB) (283%) and SGB to weed biomass (WB) ratio. Compared with Shawnee, CIR planted into a winter-killed oat residue had higher tiller density (93%), lower weed biomass (18%), higher switchgrass yield (128%) and thus a greater SGB:WB ratio (507%). Trends of switchgrass response to management practices, however, were similar between the two varieties, indicating that seed quality rather than management practices could influence switchgrass's response to management practices. In Experiment 2, Shawnee tiller density was suppressed by rye as the preceding crop, possibly due to late termination of rye. Shawnee switchgrass yields were below 1000 kg ha(-1) under all management practices; thus, harvesting should happen in the year following establishment. Future research should focus on comparing no-till drilling with cultipacker seeder with rolling not only before but after seeding to increase seed-soil contact."

Traditional tofu processing consists of numerous steps, including the soaking and grinding of soybean seeds, heating of the soybean slurry, filtering, and addition of coagulants, and others. The properties of soybean seeds, processing scale, soaking and heating conditions, type and concentration of coagulant, and other factors collectively impact the processing steps and the final tofu quality. The generation of whole soybean tofu with more nutritive value comparing with traditional tofu has been successfully reported by several studies. As one of the most important functional component, isoflavones and their presence in tofu are also influenced by the above-mentioned factors, which influence the nutritive value of tofu. Research investigating the influence of tofu processing conditions on the quality and isoflavone profiles of tofu are the subject of this review. Issues that should be further studied to investigate the influence of processing conditions on the quality and nutritive value of tofu are also introduced.

A split plot design with three replications was used. The main plots consisted of three cover crop treatments [fallow, oat (Avena sativa L.) and rye (Secale cereale L)]. The sub-plots were herbicide treatments that consisted of no herbicide or post-emergence application of atrazine (A) (1.1 kg a.i. ha(-1)) and quinclorac (Q) (0.37 kg a.i. ha(-1)). Herbicides were applied when switchgrass was at 4-leaf stage (6 weeks after planting). Switchgrass tiller density was 100% improved with application of A+Q Rye provided more effective weed control than oat; however, tiller density of switchgrass was also lower in rye treatment compared with oat and fallow. Switchgrass biomass yield was significantly lower in nontreated herbicide plots (0.22 Mg ha(-1)) than plots receiving A+Q(0.41 Mg ha(-1)).

Cowpea was planted simultaneously with scarlet eggplant, 2 and 4 weeks ahead of scarlet eggplant. Land equivalent ratio (LER) of the intercrops ranged from 1.38 to 1.94, indicating that the intercrops were more productive than the pure crops. Reduction in fruit yield of the main crop, when intercropped with the semi-spreading cowpea cultivar was significantly (p < 0.01) greater than with the erect cowpea cultivar. Simultaneous planting of cowpea and scarlet eggplant produced 90-99% the fruit yield of sole scarlet eggplant, while planting cowpea 2 and 4 weeks ahead produced 65-80% and 58-60% of sole crop yield, respectively. Competition between component crops was however most favourable for both cultivars of cowpea when planted 2 weeks ahead of scarlet eggplant. Planting cowpea 2 weeks ahead of the main crop also produced the highest LER most likely due to more efficient utilization of sunlight, water and soil nutrients. Simultaneously planting cowpea and transplanting scarlet eggplant, is recommended for such additive intercropping system, aimed at full yield of scarlet eggplant with additional cowpea for food, income or fodder.

Two tillage types (conventional plow and disk, strip-tillage (ST)), two input approaches (chemically based, biologically based) and two cropping schedules (continuous tomato Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., 3-year rotation of sweet corn [Zea mays L.]/cabbage [Brassica oleracea L.], cucumber [Cucumis sativus L.]/cabbage and tomato) were employed from 1995-1998. A second study with tomatoes was performed in 1997-1998 to separate effects of pesticide use, intercropping and herbicide application. Pitfall traps (48-h sample period) were used at similar to25-day intervals to monitor relative activity of carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae), staphylinid (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) beetles and lycosid spiders (Araneidae: Lycosidae). Carabids and lycosids appeared to be more active in systems with ground cover. Trap catches of carabid species were not significantly affected by insecticide input, but trap catches of lycosids were lower in plots with conventional insecticide use. No consistent effect of tillage was found over time, although Scarites spp. were more active in minimally disturbed habitats in 1998. Two distinct patterns of seasonal activity were observed for carabid beetles and lycosid spiders. Ground cover generally enhanced abundance of carabids and lycosids, while tillage type, pesticide use and crop rotation had different effects. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Walp) is potentially a large N source in cropping systems of Sub-Saharan Africa. A field experiment was conducted to measure cowpea N rhizodeposition under the conditions of the Sudano-Sahelian zone using direct N-15 labelling techniques to trace the amount of deposition and its transfer to associated and subsequent crops. Half of the total cowpea crop N was located below-ground at plant maturity, which exceeded 20 kgN ha(-1) when inter-cropped with millet. Only 15% of the below-ground cowpea N was recovered in roots, while 85% was found in the rhizodeposited pools. The experiment demonstrated that direct below-ground N transfer occurred from cowpea to millet in intercrop at a rate of 2 kgN ha(-1) over the growing season. Forty percent of the 25 kg below-ground N that the cowpea crop left at harvest were identifiable in the top 0.30 m soil in the beginning of the next planting season 7 months later; a pool still present at the end of that second season. Thus, the subsequent crop ofmillet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.) only recovered 2.5 kgN ha(-1) from the below-ground cowpea pre-crop N during this growth season. The role and potential of cowpea as N provider has been underestimated in the past by ignoring the large proportion of N contained in its rhizodeposits. However, information is needed to determine how losses of the rhizodeposited N can be minimized to fully harness the potential of cowpea as N provider in agro-ecosystems of the region."

A field experiment to assess the grain yield, seasonal water use (WU). water use efficiency (WUE) and precipitation use efficiency (PUE) of sunflower (Helianthus annuus l..) intercropped with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) on two tillage systems was conducted during the 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 cropping seasons at the University of Venda (22 degrees 58' 5,30 degrees 26' Eat 596 m above sea level). The experiment was configured as a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design with three replications. The tillage treatments were conventional tillage (CT) (control) and in-field rainwater harvesting (IRWH) system. The IRWH is a special crop production technique that promotes runoff on 2.0-m wide no-till strip between crop rows and collects the runoff water in basins where it infiltrates into the soil profile. The treatments in the cropping system (CS) consisted of a sole crop (sunflower or cowpea) and an intercrop (sunflower x cowpea). Results of the experiment revealed that IRWH led to a significant (P<0.05) increase in sunflower grain yield in the second season but cowpea grain yield was not influenced by tillage systems. IRWH resulted in significantly higher WU, WUE and PUE of both crops compared to CT system in the second season. The CS had significant effects on sunflower grain yield in both seasons but none on the cowpea grain yield. WU was significantly higher in intercrops than in sole cowpea and sole sunflower in the first and second season, respectively. WUE and PUE were significantly greater in sole sunflower than in the intercrops but less in the sole cowpea than in the intercrops. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is therefore imperative to development sustainable and optimal management practices that improve soil fertility. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of tillage, rotation and crop residue management on nutrient availability in a bioenergy sweet sorghum-based cropping system in marginal soils. Two tillage levels, no-till (NT) and conventional tillage (CT); two crop rotations, sweet sorghum-grazing vetch-sweet sorghum (SVS) and sweet sorghum-fallow-sweet sorghum (SFS); and three crop residue retention levels, 0%, 15% and 30%, were tested. No-till enhanced total nitrogen, total organic nitrogen (TON), magnesium (Mg) and sodium (Na) by 3.19% to 45% compared to CT. SVS rotation increased ammonium (NH4+-N) and nitrate (NO3--N) by 3.42% to 5.98% compared to SFS. A 30% crop residue retention increased NH4+-N, NO3--N, available phosphorus (Available P), cation exchange capacity (CEC), calcium (Ca), Mg and potassium (K) by 3.58% to 31.94% compared to crop residue removal. In the short term, a 30% crop residue retention was the main treatment that enhanced soil fertility. The application of NT-30% was a better practice to enhance soil fertility. However, research on inclusion of crop diversity/intercropping can add more value to the NT-30% practice in enhancing soil fertility."

Excessive and inefficient use of N fertilizer results in enhanced crop production costs and atmospheric pollution. Atmospheric nitrogen (71%) in the molecular form is not available for the plants. For world's sustainable food production and atmospheric benefits, there is an urgent need to up-grade nitrogen use efficiency in agricultural farming system. The nitrogen use efficiency is the product of nitrogen uptake efficiency and nitrogen utilization efficiency, it varies from 30.2 to 53.2%. Nitrogen losses are too high, due to excess amount, low plant population, poor application methods etc., which can go up to 70% of total available nitrogen. These losses can be minimized up to 15-30% by adopting improved agronomic approaches such as optimal dosage of nitrogen, application of N by using canopy sensors, maintaining plant population, drip fertigation and legume based intercropping. A few transgenic studies have shown improvement in nitrogen uptake and even increase in biomass. Nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, glutamine synthetase, glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase and asparagine synthetase enzyme have a great role in nitrogen metabolism. However, further studies on carbon-nitrogen metabolism and molecular changes at omic levels are required by using whole genome sequencing technology to improve nitrogen use efficiency. This review focus on nitrogen use efficiency that is the major concern of modern days to save economic resources without sacrificing farm yield as well as safety of global environment, i.e. greenhouse gas emissions, ammonium volatilization and nitrate leaching.

However, there have been few studies on the effects of groundcover on the seasonality of soil microbial carbon metabolism. We, therefore, studied soil microbial carbon metabolism in an apple orchard on China's Loess Plateau under four single species cover crops (the grass Dactylis glomerata L., and the legumes Trifolium repens, Coronilla varia L., Lotus corniculatus L.) during spring, summer and fall. Cover cropping significantly, but differentially, promoted soil microbial carbon metabolism in spring and fall. However, cover cropping leads to a significant reduction of soil moisture in spring and summer due to the competition of soil moisture between the cover crops and apple trees, which probably lead to the changes in types of carbon substances metabolizing by soil microbes in summer. Besides, cover crop significantly enhanced soil organic carbon contents between three seasons while clean cultivation had slight, non-significant effects. The promotion of soil microbial metabolic activities was probably an important mechanism for the carbon accumulation, and we postulate that leguminous cover plants may have significantly different effects, mediated through their root exudates, from grasses on soil carbon contents.

Adding okara significantly (p < 0.05) improved the yield, water-holding capacity, cooking loss, and nutritional value of the conventional tofu. The gel strength and sensory score of the okara-added tofu (OAT) increased with the decreasing of the particle size of okara, and these quality attributes of the OAT were better than those of the conventional tofu, except for the OAT with 250-380 mu m okara. The microstructural profile of the OAT with reduced okara particle size was similar to that of the conventional tofu. Theoretically, the addition of okara mainly impacted the interactions among denatured proteins via disulfide bonding and hydrophobic interactions and the sizes of insoluble solid and oil droplet in soymilk, thereby affecting the formation of the gel network and finally the edible quality of tofu. In conclusion, the addition of okara with appropriate particle sizes can remarkably improve the processing quality and nutritional value of tofu, which is beneficial to the reasonable exploration of okara for the producers of soybean products.

One of the strategies involves the use of catch crops. Catch crops can be grown in all agricultural systems, but they are particularly recommended for organic and sustainable farming. The aim of this review article was to discuss the functions performed by catch crops, with particular emphasis on their role in weed and disease control, effects on soil fertility, and the yield and chemical composition. Many plant species can be used as catch crops, which should be characterized by rapid growth in early stages of development and allelopathic properties. Popular catch crop species are Sinapis alba, Phacelia tanacetifolia and Lupinus luteus L., Vicia faba L., Vicia villosa Roht., Trifolium pratense L., Trifolium repens L., Medicago lupulina - plants from the family Leguminosae. Intercropping contributes to lower weed pressure and improves plant health by decreasing the incidence of stem base, leaf and spike diseases. Therefore, catch crops can help minimize the use of pesticides, and alleviate the adverse effects of cereal monoculture. The effectiveness of catch crops is influenced by the main crop, the type and plants of catch crops, the type of pathogen/pest and weed species, habitat conditions.

Low-cost technologies for improved productivity of dryland farming in Mali	OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE			English	Article						"pearl millet; micro-dosing; seed priming; intercropping; improved ration; integrated farming"	"PEARL-MILLET; AVAILABILITY; COWPEA; SOIL"	This study shows how low-cost options can increase agricultural productivity in the millet-producing areas of Mali. Seed priming increased millet yield by 40% in sites in the Mopti region (low rainfall). When combined with the application of 0.3 g of fertilizer per pocket, millet yield increased by 106%. In the regions further south, the best treatment was a combination of seed priming, an application of 2 g of fertilizer 15 to 20 clays after sowing, and seed treatment with fungicides/insecticides. Improved fodder rations were tested and a combination of cowpea haulm and millet bran were found to give a daily weight gain of 210 g for rams, compared with 80 g in the traditional feeding system. A conceptual integrated farm was created using the improved technologies, which was shown to generate a surplus production of both grain and fodder.	"[Aune, J.

We studied the combined effects of tillage and soil external inputs on total soil organic carbon and nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) and acid phosphomonoesterase activity (ACP). This was done in Meru South and Kandara sub-counties in Kenya for three consecutive cropping seasons. Tillage was the main factor [minimum (D-0) and conventional (D-15)], and soil external inputs were the sub-factors: sole mineral fertiliser (F), crop residues + mineral fertiliser (RF), crop residues + animal manure + legume intercrop Dolichos lablab L. (RML), crop residues + mineral fertiliser + animal manure (RFM), crop residues + Tithonia diversifolia + animal manure (RTiM), crop residues + Tithonia diversifolia + rock phosphate (RTiP) and an unfertilized treatment (Control). During the study period, we experienced frequent dry spells and meteorological droughts in the two sites. We found no significant effects of the tillage systems and mineral fertilisers applied alone or combined with crop residues on the biological properties. All additional organic inputs to the soils enhanced the biological soil properties. On average. MBC in the treatments with organic inputs only was enhanced by 51% in Meru South and 19% in Kandara. MBC-to-TOC ratio was significantly different (p - .0003) under soil external inputs in Meru South. On average. MBN in the treatments with organic inputs was enhanced by 66% in Meru South and 25% in Kandara Compared with the control, ACP was higher under RML. RTiP and RTiM by 26%. 20% and 17%, respectively in Meru South. In Kandara, ACP was higher under RTiM and RTiP by 25% and 23%, respectively, compared with the control. The increase in microbial biomass indicates that application of organic inputs contributed to soil organic C, thereby stimulating the microbial growth and enzyme activity. Thus, use of organic inputs or in combination with mineral fertilisers are feasible alternatives for sustaining soil organic carbon through increased microbial biomass leading to soil organic matter build-up, which is a vital element of soil quality and fertility.

However, the optimal planting time for a relay corn (Zea mays L) crop on flue-cured tobacco fields is unknown in terms of tobacco health, yield, quality, and economic value. A field experiment was conducted with 10, 17, 24, and 31 d after flue-cured tobacco apex excision as the relay cropping timings of corn, and tobacco monoculture as the control at Chuxiong, Yunnan, China in 2010 and 2011. The five treatments were repeated three times in a randomized complete block design. The occurrence of brown spot (Alternaria alternata), plant biomass, plant N and K nutrition, yield, chemical composition, smoking quality, and economic value of flue-cured tobacco were affected by year. Relay cropping 17 d after tobacco apex excision resulted in better chemical composition and smoking quality. The incidence and severity index of brown spot, plant biomass, plant N and K nutrition, yield, chemical composition, smoking quality, and economic value of tobacco were not significantly affected by the relay cropping timing of corn, indicating that relay cropping of corn at a later growth stage of flue-cured tobacco has no negative effect on tobacco production while the relay corn crop may bring additional income to tobacco growers. In conclusion, if the production of relay corn is profitable, relay cropping of corn after flue-cured tobacco apex excision could become a recommended cropping system in Yunnan and other regions with similar environmental conditions.

However, root distributions and root tendencies are difficult to study because root systems grow beneath the soil surface. In this study, a transparent root box was used to observe interactions between root systems in situ, and the relation between tomato growth and root proliferation at different depths and distance from the rows at no P added and 120 mg kg(-1) P added levels were also tested. We found that tomato shoot and total biomass increased and roots grew deeper when companion cropped with potato onion under both P levels. Moreover, tomato roots tended to grow away from the potato onion roots. Our results suggest that a deeper and more evasive root distribution may be related to the increased plant growth of tomato when companion cropped with potato onion.

Water and radiation effect on sweet sorghum productivity	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						"sweet sorghum; radiation; water; efficiency; productivity"	"USE EFFICIENCY; MAIZE; GROWTH; YIELD; LEAF; TRANSPIRATION; INTERCEPTION; INTERCROP; RESPONSES; NITROGEN"	Suitability of sweet sorghum in Greece, where irrigation supply during crop development is limited as rainfall is scarce and evapotranspiration loss is high, is examined in relation with radiation availability. A two-year field experiment was conducted, in central Greece, imposing four soil water regimes via different irrigation treatments: (1) Highly irrigated, (2) Highly irrigated till anthesis when irrigation stopped, (3) Medium irrigated, and (4) Low irrigated. It was found that above-ground dry biomass production from non-water-stressed sweet sorghum plants suggests a high productivity potential among C-4 crops. Under water shortage, radiation use efficiency may be significantly lower. Radiation use efficiency seems to be linearly related to water consumption. Stressed plants (probably except severely stressed) seem to use available water more efficiently than unstressed plants. The slope of the line relating dry matter produced and water evapotranspired increases the sooner the stress is sensed. Yield reduction resulting from post-anthesis irrigation stopage is very little. High water use efficiency values tend to be related with low radiation use efficiency values.

Spatio-temporal design of strip cropping systems	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						"Intercropping; Crop diversification; Spatial diversity; ROTAT; RotaStrip"	"NATURAL ENEMIES; VEGETABLE FARMS; BIODIVERSITY; MANAGEMENT; MODEL; TOOL; CONSERVATION; SUPPORT; PEA"	"CONTEXT: Crop diversification has been proposed as a promising strategy for transitioning towards sustainable agricultural systems by leveraging biological processes and controls present in naturally biodiverse ecosystems. Strip cropping, a form of intercropping where two or more crops are grown adjacent to one another in long and narrow multi-row strips, has been shown to deliver a greater range of ecosystem services compared to sole crop references due to increased interspecific crop interactions, spatio-temporal niche differentiation, and higher in-field habitat diversity. The possibility to adjust the strip width to the working width of farmers' existing machines gives strip cropping of cash crops an important implementation advantage over other intercropping practices. Systematic exploration and evaluation of spatial plans for strip cropping systems, however, is constrained by the lack of spatially-explicit design approaches. OBJECTIVE: Here we present a framework to support systematic exploration of spatio-temporal strip cropping configurations for a given farm context and set of objectives. METHODS: The framework comprises six steps: 1) Diagnosis of the current farm situation; 2) Specification of strip cropping system attributes; 3) Temporal strip cropping planning; 4) Spatio-temporal strip cropping planning; 5) Spatio-temporal strip cropping configuration assessment; 6) Strip cropping configuration selection and visualization. We combine two software applications: ROTAT to generate crop rotations and the novel RotaStrip to systematically explore spatio-temporal configurations based on the rotations generated by ROTAT. We illustrate the framework with a case study from the Netherlands using gross margin, habitat score, and spatial crop compatibility score as indicators. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: 150 crop rotations were generated. When 6 additional crops were included this was increased to 51,371, and the maximum values of the three indicator scores were also improved. Using the thirteen candidate crops to generate spatio-temporal configurations, we identified 16 Pareto-optimal and 78 anti -optimal configurations, from which the highest and lowest performing configurations were selected. The two contrasting configurations scored 7254 and 6658 euro .ha(-1).yr(-1) for gross margin, 0.88 and 0.75 for habitat score, and 98 and-58 for crop compatibility score, respectively, illustrating the value of consideration of the spatial aspects. Bridging the current knowledge gaps regarding what constitute good crop combinations, and strengthening the evidence underpinning the evaluation of ecosystem service delivery on the basis of spatial configuration, would further improve the quality of the generated strip cropping plans. SIGNIFICANCE: The framework presented and illustrated in this study provides a basis for systematic spatio-temporal strip cropping systems design and implementation."

However, long-term use of agrochemicals has numerous negative effects on crops and the environment. Bearing in mind these negative impacts, the EU strategy for withdrawing many herbicides from use, and modern market demands for the production of healthy and safe food, there is a need for developing new effective, sustainable, and ecological weed control measures. To bring a fresh perspective on this topic, this paper aims to describe the most important non-chemical weed control strategies, including ecological integrated weed management (EIWM), limiting weed seed bank, site-specific weed management, mechanical weeding, mulching, crop competitiveness, intercropping, subsidiary crops, green manure, and bioherbicides.

Ecological Intensification of Food Production by Integrating Forages	AGRONOMY-BASEL			English	Article						"ecological intensification; multifunctional agriculture; ecosystem services; annual cover crops; annual forages; forage mixtures; perennial forages; intercropping; interseeding; dual-use crops; forages"	"CROP-LIVESTOCK SYSTEMS; PLANT SILPHIUM-PERFOLIATUM; GRASS COMPANION CROPS; CLOVER LIVING MULCH; COVER CROPS; KURA CLOVER; INTERMEDIATE WHEATGRASS; SUSTAINABLE INTENSIFICATION; PERENNIAL FORAGES; YIELD STABILITY"	Forage crops have the potential to serve multiple functions, providing an ecological framework to sustainably intensify food production, i.e., ecological intensification. We review three categories of forages (annual forages, perennial forages, and dual-use perennial crops/forages) we believe hold the greatest promise for ecologically intensifying food production. Annual cover crops can provide additional forage resources while mitigating nutrient losses from agricultural fields when they are intercropped with, interseeded into, or following an annual crop, for instance. The integration of perennial forages either temporally, such as annual crop rotations that include a perennial forage phase, or spatially, such as the intercropping of perennial forages with an annual cash crop, provide weed suppression, soil quality, and yield and crop quality benefits. Dual-use crops/forages can provide forage and a grain crop in a single year while providing multiple ecological and economic benefits. However, tradeoffs in balancing multiple functions and limitations in reducing the risks associated with these practices exist. Advancing our understanding of these systems so we can overcome some of the limitations will play a critical role in increasing food production while promoting positive environmental outcomes.

To address these issues, allelopathy, i.e., the biochemical phenomenon of chemical interactions between plants through the release of secondary metabolites into the environment, is gaining popularity. Although many important crops are known for their allelopathic potential, farmers are still reluctant to use such knowledge practically. It is therefore important to assist advisors and farmers in assessing whether allelopathy can be effectively implemented into an eco-friendly weed management strategy. Here, we aim to give a comprehensive and updated review on the herbicidal potential of allelopathy. The major findings are the following: (1) Crops from different botanical families show allelopathic properties and can be cultivated alone or in combination with other non-allelopathic crops. (2) Many allelopathic tools can be adopted (crop rotation, intercropping, cover cropping as living or dead mulches, green manuring, use of allelochemical-based bioherbicides). (3) These methods are highly flexible and feature increased efficiency when combined into an integrated weed management strategy. (4) Recent advances in the chemistry of allelopathy are facilitating the use of allelochemicals for bioherbicide production. (5) Several biotechnologies, such as stress induction and genetic engineering techniques, can enhance the allelopathic potential of crops or introduce allelopathic traits de novo. This review shows how important the role of allelopathy for sustainable weed management is and, at the same time, indicates the need for field experiments, mainly under an integrated approach. Finally, we recommend the combination of transgenic allelopathy with the aforementioned allelopathic tools to increase the weed-suppressive efficacy of allelopathy.

Integration strategies and management guidelines are needed to optimize production of these new crops, which differ substantially from both annual grain crops and perennial forages. To offset relatively low grain yields, perennial grain cropping systems should be multifunctional. Growing perennial grains for several years to regenerate soil health before rotating to annual crops and growing perennial grains on sloped land and ecologically sensitive areas to reduce soil erosion and nutrient losses are two strategies that can provide ecosystem services and support multifunctionality. Several perennial cereals can be used to produce both grain and forage, and these dual-purpose crops can be intercropped with legumes for additional benefits. Highly diverse perennial grain polycultures can further enhance ecosystem services, but increased management complexity might limit their adoption.

However, little is known about their nutritional value. The Arvalis Plant Institute and INRA each carried out a study on the nutritional qualities of several intercrop species. They found that fresh forage harvested at the vegetative stage was highly nutritional (containing as much as 1.13 French feed units for lactation, 158 g of metabolisable protein [PDIE], and 225 g of rumen degradable protein [PDIN] per kg DM). Silage can be made despite the forage's low dry matter content and high buffering capacity (Agroscope study). In Wallonia, the quality of intercrop silage is good (0.76 French feed units for lactation, 102 g of metabolisable protein [PDIE], 81 g of rumen degradable protein [PDIN] per kg DM). Many of the study species contained secondary compounds, which can improve livestock health and livestock product quality. They can also reduce negative environmental impacts.

Overuse of phosphorus fertilizers results in low phosphorus use efficiency (PUE), has serious environmental consequences and accelerates the depletion of phosphorus mineral reserves. It has become extremely challenging to improve PUE while preserving global food supplies and maintaining environmental sustainability. Molecular and genetic analyses have revealed the primary mechanisms of phosphorus uptake and utilization and their relationships to phosphorus transporters, regulators, root architecture, metabolic adaptations, quantitative trait loci, hormonal signaling and microRNA. The ability to improve PUE requires a transition from this knowledge of molecular mechanisms and plant architecture to practical strategies. These could include: i) the use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal symbioses for efficient phosphorus mining and uptake; ii) intercropping with suitable crop species to achieve phosphorus activation and mobilization in the soil; and iii) tissue-specific overexpression of homologous genes with advantageous agronomic properties for higher PUE along with breeding for phosphorus-efficient varieties and introgression of key quantitative trait loci. More effort is required to further dissect the mechanisms controlling phosphorus uptake and utilization within plants and provide new insight into the means to efficiently improve PUE."

Background and Aims: The control of iron (Fe) chlorosis by synthetic Fe chelates is costly and their application can have adverse environmental impacts. We investigated the effectiveness of alternative vineyard strategies to prevent Fe chlorosis in grapevines. Methods and Results: An experiment was conducted over two consecutive seasons on Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon grafted on the Fe-chlorosis susceptible Vitis riparia grown in pots filled with calcareous soil. Intercropping with Festuca rubra enhanced leaf chlorophyll index and reduced the root activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase enzyme, a physiological marker of Fe deficiency. This response was similar to that of supplying Fe-ethylenediamine-N,N'-bis(2-hydroxyphenyl) acetic acid to soil. Application of ammonium with 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (a nitrification inhibitor) increased leaf chlorophyll index and stomatal length, and induced root biochemical responses similar to those with Fe-ethylenediamine-N, N'-bis(2-hydroxyphenylaceticacid) application. Leaf-applied Fe-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid induced a high root citric acid concentration, suggesting a limited translocation of Fe from leaves to roots. Intercropping with Festuca rubra decreased the leaf fluorescence-derived parameters in the first year and increased the leaf stomata conductance in the second year of the experiment. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the potential for preventing grapevine Fe chlorosis more sustainably through managing ammonium nutrition and adopting intercropping with Fe-efficient grasses. Significance of the Study: The data provide evidence of the effectiveness and physiological responses of agronomic strategies, alternative to synthetic Fe chelates, for preventing Fe deficiency in the grapevine.

The most economically damaging weeds for temperate legumes are broomrapes, in particular Orobanche crenata. Broomrape species such as Orobanche foetida, Orobanche minor, and Phelipanche aegyptiaca can also induce high local damage. Other parasitic weeds such as Striga gesnerioides and Alectra vogelii decrease yield of legume crops throughout semi-arid areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Dodders such as Cuscuta campestris can be damaging for some crops. Here, we review methods to control parasitic weeds. Preventing the movement of weed seeds into uninfested areas is a crucial component of control. Once a field is infested with parasitic weeds, controlling its seed production is very difficult. The only effective way to cope with parasitic weeds is to apply an integrated approach. Seedbank demise can be achieved by fumigation and solarization. However, this method is not economically feasible for low-value and low-input legume crops. A number of cultural practices including delayed sowing, hand weeding, no-tillage, nitrogen fertilization, intercropping, or rotations can contribute to seed bank demise. Other strategies such as suicidal germination, activation of systemic acquired resistance, biocontrol or target site herbicide resistance are promising solutions that are being explored but are not yet ready for direct application. The only methods currently available to farmers are the use of resistant varieties and chemical control, although both have their limitations. Chemical control with systemic herbicides such as glyphosate or imidazolinones at low rates is possible. Advances in modeling and the availability of new technologies allow the development of precision agriculture or site-specific farming. The most economical and environmentally friendly control option is the use of resistant crop varieties; however, breeding for resistance is a difficult task considering the scarce and complex nature of resistance in most crops. These strategies for parasitic weed management in legume crops will be presented and critically discussed."

WILDLIFE BIOLOGY			English	Article						"browsing; European rabbit; intercropping; Oryctolagus cuniculus; pest control; Vitis vinifera; yield"	"ORYCTOLAGUS-CUNICULUS; INTERCROPPING SYSTEM; VEGETATIVE GROWTH; LONG-TERM; WATER-USE; GRAPEVINE; YIELD; ABUNDANCE; EFFICIENCY; DYNAMICS"	Damage caused by wildlife foraging can lead to significant agricultural losses and the problem can be further complicated if the damage-inducing animal is a valuable resource in its own right. Provision of alternative food sources such as cover crops might be a means of reducing the damage which appears to be linked to scarcity of alternative foods in intensively-managed agroecosystems. Cover crops may provide other benefits to agroecosystems, i.e. preventing soil erosion but can potentially have some undesired consequences, i.e. water competition with the cash crop. In our study, we tested the effectiveness of cover crops in reducing the damage caused by foraging European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus to vineyards in a semi-arid agroecosystem in southern Spain. Experimental treatments consisted of a combination of the presence/absence of sown cover crops (70% oat Avena sativa and 30% garden vetch Vicia sativa) with/without rabbit exclusion. In the 2009 growing season, we assessed rabbit-induced damage using a browsing index on vine shoots, rabbit use of plots was estimated based on faecal pellet counts and grapevine yield was measured at harvest. Rabbits ate the cover crops, and rabbit use was highest in the plots sown with the oat and vetch cover crop. However, the effect of the presence of the cover crop on the amount of damage caused by rabbits was limited and, moreover, the presence of the cover crop had a negative effect on grapevine yield. Exclosure fences effectively reduced rabbit damage by keeping rabbit densities close to zero, but even a low rabbit number ( similar to 1 rabbit/ha) can cause significant damage. Although cover crops provided rabbits with an alternative food source, they acted as attractants for rabbits and were not effective in reducing the damage caused to vineyards by higher rabbit numbers. Therefore, adding cover crops might not be an effective measure in controlling rabbit-induced damage in semi-arid wine-growing regions.

We compared three potato mixtures and use of mixtures in combination with different planting densities and two fungicide regimes. Treatment comparisons were made by absolute and relative measures of host-diversity effects and incorporating a truncated area under the disease progress curve as a means of standardizing comparisons across sites. Potato-faba intercrops consisting of only 10% potato provided an estimate of the effects of dilution of susceptible host tissue. Host-diversity effects were very different across study sites, with a large host-diversity effect for reduced disease only at the site most distant from commercial potato production. Planting density had little influence on host-diversity effects or on late blight in single-genotype stands. Fungicide use in combination with potato mixtures enhanced a host-diversity effect for reduced late blight. Potato-faba intercrops produced only a small decrease in potato late blight. Effects of host diversity on yield were variable, with the greatest increase in yield for mixtures treated with fungicides at the site most distant from commercial potato production. The effects of host diversity on late blight severity may be less consistent in the tropical highlands than in the temperate zone, but can contribute to integrated disease management.

A comparison of diversification modes showed that spider abundance in the crop was increased in 33% of studies by 'aggregated diversification' (e.g. intercropping and non-crop strips) and in 80% of studies by `interspersed diversification' (e.g., undersowing, partial weediness, mulching and reduced tillage). It is suggested that spiders tend to remain in diversified patches and that extending the diversification throughout the whole crop (as in interspersed diversification) offers the best prospects for improving pest control. There is little evidence that spiders walk in significant numbers into fields from uncultivated field edges, but diversification at the landscape level serves to foster large multi-species regional populations of spiders which are valuable as a source of aerial immigrants into newly planted crops. There are very few manipulative field studies where the impact of spiders on pests has been measured in diversified crops compared with undiversified controls. It is encouraging, however, that in those few studies an increased spider density resulted in improved pest control. Future work needs are identified.

J	"McLaughlin, A; Mineau, P"				"McLaughlin, A; Mineau, P"			The impact of agricultural practices on biodiversity	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"biodiversity; tillage; drainage; intercropping; rotation; grazing; pesticides; fertilizers"	"TILLAGE SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; SOIL; SASKATCHEWAN; PERFORMANCE; FERTILITY; BIOMASS; WHEAT; FLAX"	"Agricultural activities such as tillage, drainage, intercropping, rotation, grazing and extensive usage of pesticides and fertilizers have significant implications for wild species of flora and fauna. Species capable of adapting to the agricultural landscape may be limited directly by the disturbance regimes of grazing, planting and harvesting, and indirectly by the abundance of plant and insect foods available. Some management techniques, such as drainage, create such fundamental habitat changes that there are significant shifts in species composition. This paper considers the relative merits of conventional tillage versus reduced, or no-till farming, and reviews the benefits of rest-rotation grazing, crop rotation and intercropping in terms of maintaining wild species populations. There are a number of undesirable environmental impacts associated with fertilizer and pesticide usage, and in this paper we attempt to provide an account of the ways in which these inputs impact on biodiversity at various levels including plant, invertebrate, and vertebrate groups. Factors which are considered include the mobility, trophic interactions, persistence, and spectrum of toxicity for various pesticides. The ecological virtues of organic and inorganic fertilizers are compared, and the problems arising from excessive use of fertilizer are discussed. The findings in this review indicate that chemical fertilizer loadings must be better budgeted to not exceed local needs, and that pesticide inputs should be reduced to a minimum. The types and regimes of disturbance due to mechanical operations associated with agricultural activity may also be modified to help reduce negative impacts on particular groups of species, such as birds. For those plant and insect species which need to be controlled for agronomic reasons, the population decreases brought about by disturbance regimes may be desirable as a form of pest management. The prevalence of agriculture over such a large portion of the Canadian landscape means that it is important that we find solutions to conflicts that arise between agriculture and wild species. It is important to realize that the impact of agricultural inputs varies greatly among regions and species, and actual effects have generally not been investigated for many species in any one locality; while the focus of this review is on Canada, much Canadian-specific research is lacking, thus, this review also draws from relevant research done elsewhere."

J	"Harris, D; Orr, A"				"Harris, David; Orr, Alastair"			Is rainfed agriculture really a pathway from poverty?	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						"Rainfed crop profitability; Smallholders; Farm size; Income limits; Poverty; New technology"	"WHEAT TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; SOIL FERTILITY MANAGEMENT; PHOSPHORUS APPLICATION; INTERCROPPING SYSTEM; MAIZE; YIELD; TECHNOLOGY; FARMERS; PROFITABILITY; PERFORMANCE"	Agriculture's potential to reduce poverty at household level is explored for rainfed crop production in Africa and India. A literature survey of crop improvement and natural resource management interventions demonstrates that new technology can substantially increase net returns per hectare per cropping season. However, the median net income from improved technologies was only $558/ha/season at 2005 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) and a de facto limit of around $1700/ha/season was identified, with values rarely exceeding $1000/ha/season. These values for net returns from the literature were mostly derived from small-plot studies and are likely to be overestimates when technologies are implemented by farmers on larger areas. Crop production could be a pathway from poverty where smallholders are able to increase farm size or where markets stimulate crop diversification, commercialisation and increased farm profitability. For most smallholders, however, small farm size and limited access to markets mean that returns from improved technology are too small for crop production alone to lift them above the poverty line and the direct benefit will be improved household food security.

We assessed responses of selected soil physical and chemical properties to tillage and soil fertility amending resources. The study was carried out in Meru South and Kandara sub-counties located in the Central Highlands of Kenya for four cropping seasons. The experimental design was split-plot with tillage as the main factor - conventional (D-15) - and minimum (D-0) tillage and soil fertility resources (SFR) as sub-factors - mineral fertilizer (F), crop residues + fertilizer (RF), residues + fertilizer + animal manure (RFM), residues + Tithonia diversifolia + manure (RTiM), residues + Tithonia diversifolia + phosphate rock (Minjingu) (RTiP), residues + manure + legume intercrop (RML) and control (no input). Compared with control, aggregate stability was significantly higher on average under SFRs with sole organics by 19% in Meru South. Total N and available P were higher under integration of fertilizer and organics in both sites. Calcium increased under sole organic or integration with fertilizer in Meru South and under sole organics in Kandara. Magnesium significantly increased under all SFRs compared with control in Kandara. Soil organic carbon significantly (P=0.02) increased under D-0 by 6% compared to D-15 in 0-5 cm depth in Kandara. Application of RTiM had the highest SOC in all depths' at Meru South. SOC significantly increased under RTiP and RML by 11% in 0-5 cm depth and under RML by 13% in 5-10 cm depth at Kandara. Mineral-N (NO3--N and NH4+-N) was higher under D-0 at planting compared with D-15 in Meru South. In Kandara, NO3--N and NH4+-N were significantly higher by 17% and 30%, respectively under D-0 compared with D-15 at planting during SR16 season. Higher mineral N was recorded under F application on the 30th and 45th days in both sites. The highest mineral-N content was on the 45th day after planting during SR16 season and on the 30th day during LR17 season at Meru South. In Kandara, NO3--N and NH4+-N were highest on the 45th day and 30th day, respectively, during SR16 season. During LR17 season, mineral-N was highest on the 30th day in Kandara. The study highlights that minimal soil disturbance and organic inputs use or integration with fertilizers are feasible alternatives for improving soil fertility in the Nitisols of Central Highlands of Kenya.

Thus, a series of ecological agricultural engineering measures was established in 2011, as a field experiment using citrus (navel orange) plants to reduce soil erosion, which was monitored from 2011 to 2018. These ecological agricultural engineering measures included three treatments: 1) citrus intercropped with white clover (WC), 2) citrus orchard land mulched with straw (SM) and 3) citrus intercropped with hemerocallis (Hemerocallis flava) contour hedgerows (CH). The conventional citrus orchard management was regarded as control (CK). The results show, that compared with CK, nutrient loss from the experiments were reduced by the following amounts: for nitrogen - WC (35.5%), SM (44.0%) and CH (52.0%); for phosphorus - WC (40.0%), SM (51.7%) and CH (58.3%). Therefore, the ecological agricultural engineering measures effectively mitigate the nutrient loss loads of the navel orange citrus gardens. The citrus intercropped with the hemerocallis hedgerows is the most effective measure for the control of nutrient loss. After 8 years of experiment, the soil quality represented by average soil quality index (SQI) in these three treatments, are significantly higher than that of the CK (and the beginning of the experiment). This is because the application of these measures prevented the loss of: soil organic matter, bulk density and total phosphorus. It is predicted that the soil qualities of these three treatments will remain in the range of soil grade II and I for the next 5 years but the soil quality of CK will decrease to soil quality grade II and III. These results show that ecological agricultural engineering measures are a long-term promising and feasible method to reduce soil erosion and enhance soil quality. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Dose-response models to guide site-specific nutrient management and lessons for fertiliser trial design in sub-Saharan Africa	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Review						"Liebig's law; Mitscherlich's law; Plateau function"	"NITROGEN USE EFFICIENCY; MAIZE SOLE CROP; MODIFIED MITSCHERLICH; INTERCROP RESPONSE; ECONOMIC RESPONSE; YIELD RESPONSE; WHEAT; RICE; RECOMMENDATIONS; HIGHLANDS"	"Optimisation of fertiliser use and site-specific nutrient management are increasingly becoming critical because of the growing need to balance agricultural productivity with the growing demand for food and environmental concerns. Trials to determine responses of crops to fertilisers have been widely conducted in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) with increasing emphasis on the development of economically optimum rates (EORs). Computation of EORs depends on accurate estimation of both the optimum nutrient rate and the agronomic maximum yield response; however, estimation of nutrient-response parameters and EORs is beset by a number of problems. Therefore, the objectives of this paper were to (1) point out common problems in the development and use of nutrient dose-response models and (2) provide corrective measures to facilitate future trial design and data analysis. This review outlines the underlying assumptions, strengths and limitations of the various response functions in order to facilitate informed choices by practitioners. Using specific examples, it also shows that (1) the commonly used trial designs do not allow examination of interactions between two or more nutrients and (2) trial designs with <= 5 nutrient levels and wide spacing between the levels result in large uncertainty in dose-response parameters. The key recommendations emerging from the review are as follows: (1) factorial designs and response surface models should be used more widely to address interactions between nutrients; (2) a minimum of six carefully spaced nutrient levels should be used to correctly estimate dose-response parameters; and (3) when locating field trials, Reference Soil Groups and cropping history should be carefully considered to produce site-specific EORs."

J	"Barriball, S; Han, A; Schlautman, B"				"Barriball, Spencer; Han, Abigail; Schlautman, Brandon"			Effect of growing degree days, day of the year, and cropping systems on reproductive development of Kernza in Kansas	AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							"SEASON PERENNIAL GRASSES; INTERMEDIATE WHEATGRASS; WINTER-WHEAT; FORAGE YIELD; GRAIN; GROWTH; MORPHOLOGY; MIXTURES; QUALITY; ALFALFA"	Reproductive growth and development of cool-season grasses is primarily driven by air temperature and photoperiod. This study was conducted near Salina, KS, to model the effects of growing degree days (GDD), day of the year (DOY), and cropping systems on first- and second-year intermediate wheatgrass [Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & D.R. Dewey] (IWG) in Kernza perennial grain production systems. In 2018 and 2019, GDD and DOY were highly correlated with reproductive growth and development (i.e., mean stage count, head meristem height, and leaf, stem, and head biomass fractions). Row spacing, fertilization, and intercropping with alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) did not influence IWG reproductive growth and development. Across years, DOY more closely predicted reproductive stages than GDD, indicating a greater response to photoperiod than air temperature. After stem initiation, the fraction of total biomass allocated to leaves decreased, whereas stem and head biomass increased in response to GDD and DOY. At anthesis, stem biomass exceeded leaf and head biomass. Parameterizing GDD and DOY models for management in IWG dual-purpose, Kernza grain production systems will require additional datasets from many locations and environments.

This pre-feasibility study evaluates the use of green biomass of buckwheat, phacelia, hemp and oilseed radish grown as intermediate crops (IC) as a feedstock for production of protein concentrates to produce protein-rich food and feed products. We investigated the biomass yield, protein concentration and protein recovery potential of non-fertilized IC, nitrogen-fertilized IC and IC intercropped with legumes, harvested in late summer to autumn during 2017 and 2018 in southern Sweden. In addition, economic assessment of potential protein and fibre feed and food products were evaluated. The results showed that IC fertilized with 40 kg ha(-1) N and intercropping with legumes contributed to a higher biomass dry matter (DM) yield of 4.9-5.8 t ha(-1) as compared to between 2.2 and 3.1 t ha(-1) for non-fertilized IC. Intercropping with legumes also resulted in higher protein yield of 154 g kg(-1) vs. 103 g kg (-1) for non-fertilized IC. Among IC, hemp, phacelia and oilseed radish showed up to ca. 25% higher DM yield and up to ca. 70% higher protein concentration as compared to buckwheat. Higher DM yield was obtained when IC were harvested in October and November than in August and September. Economic assessment was made on two feasible protein production pathways; (A) Green and white proteins and (B) total recoverable combined protein fraction (CPF). For all IC, cost per t DM was higher in August due to lower biomass yield as compared to other harvesting months. Nitrogen concentration was the main factor determining the size of revenues. Nitrogen concentration was 34% higher in 2018 compared to 2017 and therefore resulted in higher revenues in that year. Intercropping resulted in higher protein content and therefore contributed to lower breakeven prices of recovered green proteins for all IC. Breakeven price analyses showed that green protein and CPF were economically feasible to market as both bulk and premium products depending on lower (similar to 2 V kg(-1)) or higher (2-10 V kg(-1)) price ranges, respectively. The results demonstrate that use of IC biomass could be a feasible option to produce high value protein-rich products, which can contribute extra income from IC for farmers. (c) 2021 The Authors.

Zinc nutrition in chickpea (Cicer arietinum): a review	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE			English	Review						"plant biology; plant breeding"	"ABIOTIC STRESS TOLERANCE; EARLY SEEDLING GROWTH; WHEAT GENOTYPES; PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS; REACTIVE OXYGEN; USE EFFICIENCY; NITROGEN-FIXATION; GRAIN-YIELD; MICRONUTRIENT MALNUTRITION; MINERAL MICRONUTRIENTS"	"Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is an important grain legume that is grown and consumed all over the world. Chickpea is mostly grown in rainfed areas and marginal soils with low available zinc (Zn); however, its productivity is affected by micronutrient deficiencies in soil, particularly Zn deficiency. Zinc is a structural constituent and regulatory cofactor of enzymes involved in various plant biochemical pathways. As such, Zn deficiency impairs plant growth and development by reducing enzyme activity, disturbing ribosomal stabilisation, and decreasing the rate of protein synthesis. Moreover, Zn deficiency induces flower abortion and ovule infertility, leading to low seedset and substantial yield reductions. Nonetheless, inclusion of chickpea in cropping systems (e.g. rice-wheat), either in rotation or intercropped with cereals, improves Zn availability in the soil through the release of phosphatases, carboxylates, and protons by roots and soil microbes. This review discusses the role of Zn in chickpea biology, various factors affecting Zn availability, and Zn dynamics in soil and chickpea-based cropping systems. The review also covers innovative breeding strategies for developing Zn-efficient varieties, biofortification, and agronomic approaches for managing Zn deficiency in chickpea. Strategies to improve grain yield and grain Zn concentration in chickpea through use of different Zn-application methods-soil, foliar and seed treatments-that are simple, efficient and cost-effective for farmers are also discussed. Screening of efficient genotypes for root Zn uptake and translocation to the grain should be included in breeding programs to develop Zn-efficient chickpea genotypes."

Scanning electron microscope analysis suggested that HSS disintegrated and degraded the component cell layers at the cellular level. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the reflection intensity of crystalline plane (I-002) and the amorphous contribution (I-AM) declined after HSS, confirming that the degradation of okara fibers was accompanied with the disintegration of crystalline as well as amorphous area. Moreover, the reflection intensity of cellulose's triclinic structure went up after HSS, which might be attributed to the breakdown of beta-1, 4-glycoside bond. The swelling capacity and water holding capacity extensively declined (p < 0.05) from 5.5 mL/g and 8.5 g/g to 2.2 mL/g and 4.9 g/g after shearing, which was caused by the degradation of porous structure and the decrease of pore volume. HSS empowered okara fiber better solubility as well, and it might be achieved by breaking the cellulose-cellulose hydrogen bonds and redistributing the fiber composition from the insoluble to the soluble fraction. Consequently, HSS provided a cost-efficient way to disintegrate substrates and modify hydration properties of okara fiber, which possessed considerable application prospects in soy industry.

The impact of cover crops and foliar application of micronutrients on accumulation of macronutrients in potato tubers at technological maturity stage	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						"chemical composition; farmyard manure; green manure; macronutrients acquisition"	"NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION; CATCH CROPS; DRY-MATTER; PHOSPHORUS; GROWTH; YIELD; WHEAT; SOIL; NUTRITION; ALLOCATION"	The aim of the study was to assess the effect of mineral fertilization (NPK) in combination with manure and stubble crops (white mustard, pea, phacelia) and foliar application of micronutrients on the content and accumulation of macro-elements (N, P, K, Mg and Ca) in potato tubers at the of stage technological maturity. The tested plant was a potato cultivar The experiment was carried out in 2010-2012, at the Wierzchucinek Research Station of the Bydgoszcz University of Technology and Life Sciences. The experimental factors were (1) fertilizer variants (n=5): the control (NPK), NPK + manure (FYM + NPK), NPK + white mustard (NPK + WM), NPK + pea (NPK + P), NPK + blue phacelia (NPK + PH), and (II) foliar fertilization with micronutrients (n=2): no fertilization with microelements (MO) and applications of fertilizer (M1). Micronutrients were applied twice a vegetation season in the form of a chelated fertilizer. The content and accumulation of nutrients in potato tubers at the stage of technological maturity were analyzed. It was found that the applied mineral NPK fertilization (the control), when in combination manure treatment and the three intercrops, significantly differentiated the content of all the studied nutrients in potato tubers. The highest concentration of nitrogen and calcium in tubers was found in the control plants, while highest concentrations of P, K and Mg were observed in tubers grown after manure application. Significantly higher nitrogen content (exclusive of 2011) as well as that of phosphorus were observed in the treatments with no foliar fertilization. In the case of magnesium and calcium, the relationship was reversed (exclusive of Ca content recorded in 2010). The experimental factors significantly differentiated the uptake values of all the nutrients analyzed and, irrespective of the study year, the largest accumulation of nutrients in potato tubers was found in the experimental variant with manure and micronutrient fertilizer application. The highest uptake of nutrients was recorded in tubers grown after pea intercrop as compared with other two intercrops tested. The correlation analysis as regards tuber yields, dry mass and starch as well as the total accumulation of nutrients, showed that regardless of the experimental variant analyzed, there was a highly significant correlation between yield/starch content and uptake of all the macronutrients under the study. Accordingly, intercropping may be an alternative to manure in potato fertilization as it does not require large expenditure, and constitutes the source of macronutrients and organic matter, as well as improves soil structure and prevents its degradation.

Yields are generally low and variable. Water balance modelling in the Magway Region was used to identify opportunities for improvement. Annual rainfall from 1951 to 2016 was 754 mm (CV = 0.22), with 668 mm (CV = 0.26) in the growing season of 180 days (CV = 0.15). Variable rainfall and low soil water holding capacity lead to wide inter- and intra-annual fluctuation between water deficit and excess, with nutrient leaching expected from substantial deep percolation (61 mm yr(-1)). Despite variable rainfall, monsoon crops of 80-90 days duration had relatively stable ET (CV = 0.09) suggesting reliable potential yields, estimated to average 2.9 t ha(-1) for groundnut. Reliable yields should also be achievable when this crop is intercropped with long duration (180 days) pigeon pea, a system that ensures income from the intercrop whilst having the capacity to adapt to variable post-monsoon conditions. The challenge with monsoon crops and pigeon pea is to effectively provide soluble nutrients (N, S) in a leaching environment, and P when surface soil is frequently dry. The post-monsoon crop in a double-crop system is risky, with variable ET (CV = 0.37) and yield potential. An option here is to vary inputs according to the potential, which is high with early sowing on a wet soil profile. Rainfall has declined since the 1950's, notably in June-July, but with no discernible effect on planting date or growing season length. There are now fewer but larger rainfall events, with implications for hydrology, agronomy and soil conservation.

To understand the effects of conservation tillage on soil nutrients and yield, a long-term experiment was set up in a region affected by water and wind erosion on the Loess Plateau. The treatments used were traditional tillage (CK), no tillage (NT), straw mulching (SM), plastic-film mulching (PM), ridging and plastic-film mulching (RPM) and intercropping (In). Our results demonstrate that the available nutrients in soils subjected to non-traditional tillage treatments decreased during the first several years and then remained stable over the last several years of the experiment. The soil organic matter and total nitrogen content increased gradually over 6 years in all treatments except CK. The nutrient content of soils subjected to conservative tillage methods, such as NT and SM, were significantly higher than those in soils under the CK treatment. Straw mulching and film mulching effectively reduced an observed decrease in soybean yield. Over the final 6 years of the experiment, soybean yields followed the trend RPM > PM > SM > NT > CK > In. This trend has implications for controlling soil erosion and preventing non-point source pollution in sloping fields by sacrificing some food production.

Allelopathy for weed control in agricultural systems	CROP PROTECTION			English	Review						"Yield losses; Weeds; Allelopathy; Allelopathic activity; Weed management; Crop improvement"	"ECHINOCHLOA-CRUS-GALLI; CANOLA BRASSICA-NAPUS; COVER CROPS; COMPETITIVE ABILITY; WATER EXTRACTS; WHEAT GENOTYPES; RICE PRODUCTION; HULL EXTRACTS; MANAGEMENT; L."	Weeds are a hidden foe for crop plants, interfering with their functions and suppressing their growth and development. Yield losses of similar to 34% are caused by weeds among the major crops, which are grown worldwide. These yield losses are higher than the losses caused by other pests in the crops. Sustainable weed management is needed in the wake of a huge decline in crop outputs due to weed pressure. A diversity in weed management tools ensures sustainable weed control and reduces chances of herbicide resistance development in weeds. Allelopathy as a tool, can be importantly used to combat the challenges of environmental pollution and herbicide resistance development. This review article provides a recent update regarding the practical application of allelopathy for weed control in agricultural systems. Several studies elaborate on the significance of allelopathy for weed management. Rye, sorghum, rice, sunflower, rape seed, and wheat have been documented as important allelopathic crops. These crops express their allelopathic potential by releasing allelochemicals which not only suppress weeds, but also promote underground microbial activities. Crop cultivars with allelopathic potentials can be grown to suppress weeds under field conditions. Further, several types of allelopathic plants can be intercropped with other crops to smother weeds. The use of allelopathic cover crops and mulches can reduce weed pressure in field crops. Rotating a routine crop with an allelopathic crop for one season is another method of allelopathic weed control. Importantly, plant breeding can be explored to improve the allelopathic potential of crop cultivars. In conclusion, allelopathy can be utilized for suppressing weeds in field crops. Allelopathy has a pertinent significance for ecological, sustainable, and integrated weed management systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Modelling nitrate transport under row intercropping system: Vines and grass cover	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						"Associated species; Vine; Grass cover; Deterministic modelling; Nitrate leaching"	"DEFINING COMPETITION VECTORS; ALLEY CROPPING SYSTEM; SOIL-WATER BALANCE; DENITRIFICATION LOSSES; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; MIDWESTERN USA; ROOT-SYSTEM; NITROGEN; VINEYARD; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION"	In the context of reduction of agricultural non-point source pollution, an associated crop system often presents several advantages. The difficulty resides in the characterisation of each species' contribution (dominant and dominated). This paper deals with the particular case of voluntary grass cover management between rows in a vine plot. We evaluate the spatial and temporal changes in the development of both crops: vine/grass cover system, in their ecological functioning and in the influences on water and nitrogen balances. We modify the SWMS_3D model to incorporate separate distribution of water and nitrogen demands for the two coexisting plant species. The parameterized model is then assessed using the measured data (water content, matrix potential and nitrogen content of the soil solution at depths of 30, 60,90 and 120 cm) acquired from two monitored vine plots (vine Tockay-Pinot Gris plot grass covered every second row compared to a control plot that was chemically weeded vine Riesling plot, France, Alsace, Rouffach) between October 1998 and September 2000. The main results are the following. The vine's mean total transpiration over the two growing seasons of 1998/1999 and 1999/2000 is simulated of 355 +/- 9 mm per season. The matrix potential is reproduced accurately especially improving with depth and under the interrow. Despite a high variability due to soil heterogeneity, the nitrogen mass variations between measurements and simulations with the adapted model are coherent. Nevertheless we note that the model slightly underestimates the nitrogen mass for both types of observed cropping patterns, however the ratio between the two itineraries remains similar, yielding a reduction in nitrogen loss by at least 4-fold in favour of grass cover every second row plot during the period observed from 10/ 01/1998 to 09/30/2000.

The purpose of the experiment was to examine the effects of elevated CO2 on the competition ability among various crops and weeds in factorial arrangement based on completely randomized block design with three replications. Treatments included ambient (360 ppm) and elevated (700 ppm) CO2 concentrations and various combinations of the plantation of crops (millet and soybean) and weeds (lambsquarters and pigweed) of C-3 and C-4 species, whether of the pure culture or intercropping. Results of the experiment showed that, as CO2 concentration increased, the leaf area and root dry weight of millet increased, whereas those of other species decreased. Millet's root length increased, whereas those of other species decreased. Root dry weight in each cultural combination, compared to the ambient CO2 concentration, decreased. The amount of chlorophyll in lambsquarters increased, whereas it decreased in pigweed, millet and soybean.	"[Anvarkhah, S.; Koocheki, A. R.; Mahallati, M.

Sesame is an important oilseed crop well adapted to the sandy soils of the West African Sahel. Intercropping of sesame and pearl millet has been reported to reduce emerged striga numbers, but formal research into the potential for sesame to contribute to control of the parasite is lacking. Field trials were undertaken to evaluate the potential of sesame grown in rotation with pearl millet to reduce striga infestation of the cereal. Emerged striga numbers and striga fruiting were strongly reduced on pearl millet following sesame compared to sole millet. To maximize cereal yield, soil fertility enhancement and water conservation are indispensable elements of integrated striga control. The results can guide future research at a time where sesame is being promoted to diversify agricultural production in the Sahel. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Pea (Pisum spp.), vetch (Vicia, Lathyrus spp.), medic (Medicago spp.), alfalfa (Medicago spp.), berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.), arrowleaf clover (T. vesiculosum L.), Persian clover (T. resupinatum L.), balansa clover [T. michelianum Savi. var. balansae (Boiss.) Azn.], rose clover (T hirtum All.), crimson clover (T incarnatum L.) and black lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) were grown at Lethbridge and Brooks, Alberta, and at Melfort and Nipawin, Saskatchewan over a 2 or 3 yr period to assess their forage yield potential under irrigation and dry-land conditions. Measurements included plant height, stand establishment, flowering date, forage yield and forage quality. Peas, winter and hairy vetch, and berseem clover were the top yielding species across locations (5452-6532 kg ha(-1)). Berseem clover, hairy vetch, winter vetch, Nitro alfalfa, and Persian clover yielded in excess of 9000 kg ha(-1) under irrigation at Brooks. Hairy and winter vetches, Magnus pea, chickling vetch (Lathyrus sativus L.) and berseem clover yielded over 4300 kg ha(-1) in dryland and rainfed locations at Lethbridge, Melfort and Nipawin. These entries had an upright growth habit, established quickly and were normally harvested twice. Crude protein concentration and yields were higher in legumes at irrigated locations in Alberta than rainfed locations in central Saskatchewan. Burr medic at the Brooks irrigated location produced the highest crude protein yield of 2495 kg ha(-1). Berseem clover, Persian clover, Nitro alfalfa, hairy and winter vetches show promise as legumes in short term rotations, as green manures and intercrops for increasing forage quality in silage or late season grazing in Western Canada.

A 3-yr, on-farm experiment was, therefore, set up to assess the effect of ridging and either banded or broadcast millet stover mulches (2000 kg ha(-1)) on soil loss in a millet-coo,pea intercrop, For wind directions approximately perpendicular to the orientation of ridges and residue bands, sediment mass balances were calculated from the change in horizontal sediment mass fluxes measured across the experimental plots with Big Spring Number Eight sand traps. Mass balance calculations for 16 events over 3 yr indicated an average soil loss of 17.5, 15,4, and 18.0 Mg ha(-1) On control plots, and deposition of 15,5, 15,3, and 7.4 Mg ha(-1) on banded residue plots in 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively, Broadcast and banded residue mulches were not significantly different (P = 0.05) in terms of their sediment trapping efficiency. During the same time period, ridges reduced soil losses by an average of 57% compared with the control plots, but their efficiency was reduced to less than 15% after 100 mm of cumulative rainfall as ridges collapsed. Linear regression analysis using the incoming sand fluxes as the independent variable was used to estimate potential soil losses for all events with sediment fluxes <25 kg m(-1) irrespective of wind direction. The calculations indicated potential soil losses of up to 79 Mg ha(-1) on control plots and deposition of 41 Mg ha(-1) on broadcast residue plots in a single gear. For wind erosion control, broadcast millet stover mulching constituted the most effective control technique because it effectively protected the soil against erosion and its trapping efficiency is expected to be independent of wind direction.

J	"PRIHAR, SS; STEWART, BA"				"PRIHAR, SS; STEWART, BA"			USING UPPER-BOUND SLOPE THROUGH ORIGIN TO ESTIMATE GENETIC HARVEST INDEX	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							"DRYLAND GRAIN-SORGHUM; IRRIGATED WINTER-WHEAT; WATER-USE; STRAW-MULCH; YIELD; CORN; NITROGEN; STORAGE; GROWTH"	Harvest index (HI), the ratio of grain to aboveground dry matter, is reported to be a species-related parameter and is recommended for screening cultivars. But the fact that it is affected by environmental stress limits its use for intercrop or intercultivar comparisons. Fair comparisons should be based on estimated genetic HI for a given environment, but a procedure to determine the same is lacking. We propose that the slope of an upper-bound in the grain yield vs. dry matter plot passing through the origin approximates the genetic HI because the highest grain yields against given dry matter represent the least-stressed and/or stress-adapted plants and passage of the line through the origin is necessary to satisfy the definition of HI. This HI also provides a useful reference for interpreting agronomic data with respect to stress effects associated with management practices. The HIs of sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], corn (Zea mays L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were estimated by the upper-bounds of grain yield (corrected to dry weight) vs. dry matter yield taken from existing reports in the literature. Harvest index of sorghum and irrigated corn ranged between narrow limits of 0.48 to 0.53 and 0.58 to 0.60, respectively. Harvest index of irrigated wheat ranged from 0.38 to 0.47. Stress effects on HI are illustrated in plots of published and unpublished (dry) grain yields vs. dry matter yields and reasons for the same are discussed.

"This study assesses the effects of plant population density (PPD) and sowing date (SD) on growth, physiology and lint yield of a cotton crop. Seedling transplanting is one of the most dominant cotton production systems in China. But on the other hand, the net benefit is decreasing because the system is labor intensive. Therefore, a shorter cotton growing season is urgently needed to reduce the production costs through management practices such as adjusting sowing date and PPD. The following hypothesis was tested; would cotton yield and physiology from a late sowing be compensated by plant density? Field experiments were conducted with two sowing dates (S-1, May 20; S-2, June 04) as the main plot and three PPDs (D-1 low; 7.5 x 10(4); D-2, moderate; 9.0 x 10(4) and D-3, high; 10.5 x 10(4) ha(-1)) as the sub-plot. Early-sown plants produced 23%, 32%, 55%, 77% and 14%, taller stems more nodes, leaves and fruits, respectively, than the late-sown plants. Consequently, S-1 produced 26% higher lint yield than S-2. This increase in lint yield was mainly attributed to a relatively longer cropping season, which allowed utilization of available resources. Growth and fruit production in S1 plants were further increased by an increased photosynthetic rate (Pn) and N acquisition. Across the plant densities, 13% and 6% more lint yield was achieved under D-2 than the D-3 and D-1, respectively. Moderate PPD increased lint yield by 13% and 6% over high and low, respectively. Nitrogen (N) acquisition was 45%, 33%, higher for S-1 sown crop compared with S-2, respectively. S1D2 had higher average (3.5 V-T kg ha(-1) d(-1)) and maximum (4.5 V-M kg ha(-1) d(-1)) rates of N accumulation in reproductive organs at the fastest accumulation point among other treatments. Our data suggest that for both sowing dates moderate PPD is a promising option, which allows light interception and penetration to the lower canopy, efficient N utilization and assimilate distribution to reproductive structures."

Inputs to these systems are often high, so optimizing N fertilizer rates may increase appeal to producers. This study evaluated the effects of increasing botanical diversity and N fertilizer application on the yield and botanical composition of summer annual mixtures in four environments in Kentucky. Nitrogen fertilizer rates of 0, 56, 112, 168, and 224 kg N ha(-1) were applied to a sudangrass [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench x Sorghum sudanese (P.) Stapf] monoculture, a three-species mixture, and an 11-species mixture. In three out of four environments, sward biomass increased as N application increased (average of 15 kg dry matter (DM) ha(-1) increase per kg N ha(-1); p < .05). Mixture complexity had no effect on forage DM accumulation in three out of four environments (4,000, 5,830, and 7,280 kg DM ha(-1) averaged over mixture for three environments; p > .05). Mixtures were overwhelmingly dominated by grasses, resulting in low functional diversity. Legumes did not respond to N (p > .05), but their contribution to sward DM was <4%. Species compatibility should be a priority when utilizing multi-species mixtures. If a stronger legume component is desired, care must be taken to provide management that favors these species, such as reduced grass-seeding rates to limit competition, especially during initial establishment."

Information on crop response to macronutrients is relatively abundant compared with secondary and micronutrients (SMN). Data from 1339 trial replicates of 280 field trials conducted from 2013 to 2016 in 11 countries were analyzed for the diagnosis of SMN deficiencies. The diagnostic data included relative yield response (RYR) and soil and foliar test results. The RYR to application of a combination of Mg, S, Zn, and B (Mg-S-Zn-B) relative to a comparable N-P-K treatment was a >5% increase for 35% of the legume blocks and 60% of the non-legume blocks. The frequencies of soil test Zn, Cu, and B being below their critical level were 28, 2 and 10% for eastern and southern Africa, respectively, and 55, 58 and 89% for western Africa, while low levels for other SMN were less frequent. The frequency of foliar results indicating low availability were 58% for Zn, 16% for S and less for other SMN. The r(2) values for relationships between soil test, foliar test and RYR results were <0.035 with little complementarity except for soil test Zn and B with cassava (Manihot esculenta L. Crantz) RYR in Ghana, and foliar Zn with cereal RYR in Uganda. Positive RYR is powerful diagnostic information and indicative of good profit potential for well-targeted and well-specified SMN application. Geo-referenced RYR, soil analysis and foliar analysis results for diagnosis of SMN deficiencies in 11 countries of sub-Saharan Africa were generally not complementary.

Yield consistency across a series of plant populations is an attractive cost-saving option. Field experiments were conducted to compare biomass accumulation, fiber quality, leaf area index, yield and yield components of cotton planted at various densities (D1, 1.5; D2, 3.3; D3, 5.1; D4, 6.9; D5, 8.7; and D6, 10.5 plants m(-2)). High planting density (D5) produced 21% and 28% more lint yield as compared to low planting density (D1) during both years, respectively. The highest seed cotton yield (4662 kg/ha) and lint yield (1763 kg/ha) were produced by high plant density (D5) while the further increase in the plant population (D6) decreased the yield. The increase in yield of D5 was due to more biomass accumulation in reproductive organs as compared to other treatments. The highest average (19.2 V-A gm m(-2) d(-1)) and maximum (21.8 V-M gm m(-2) d(-1)) rates of biomass were accumulated in reproductive structures. High boll load per leaf area and leaf area index were observed in high planting density as compared to low, while high dry matter partitioning was recorded in the lowest planting density as compared to other treatments. Plants with low density had 5% greater fiber length as compared to the highest plant density, while the fiber strength and micronaire value were 10% and 15% greater than the lowest plant density. Conclusively, plant density of 8.7 plants m(-2) is a promising option for enhanced yield, biomass, and uniform fiber quality of cotton."

Phenological and growth response of legume cover crops to shading	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article							"WEED SUPPRESSION; SUBTERRANEAN CLOVER; CROPPING SYSTEMS; LIVING MULCH; INTERCROPPING DESIGN; YIELD; MAIZE; SOIL; L.; PHOTOSYNTHESIS"	Annual medics and clovers have distinct properties in terms of usage as cover crops in Mediterranean orchards, but little is known of their capacity to adapt to the level of shading encountered on an orchard floor. A 2-year field experiment was conducted in South-Eastern Sicily to investigate the effects of withholding 0.50 of sunlight on the phenology and growth pattern of four medic and five clover accessions, focusing on traits known to be important for cover cropping. Shading delayed both seedling emergence and the onset of flowering (by up to 5 and 9 days, respectively), while it extended both the growth period and the overall life-cycle duration (by up to 5 and 11 days, respectively). It also induced an increase in cover crop height (from 34 to 38 cm) and crop light use (from 0.60 to 0.94 g DW/m(2)/MJ), but a reduction in soil coverage, above-ground dry biomass, maximum growth rate and maximum relative growth rate (by up to 13, 18, 21 and 7%, respectively), so compromising the competitiveness of cover crops against weeds. The responses to shading varied between genotypes. Medicago polymorpha ecotype S. Rosalia, Medicago rugosa ecotype Piano Lauro and ecotype Zappulla were the strongest competitors against weeds, whereas Trifolium tomentosum ecotype Bucampello was interesting in terms of its biomass yield and crop light use. The performance was unstable over seasons, so any future attempt to improve the species' performances under shade by breeding will need to focus on reseeding capacity.	"[Mauro, R.

In this research, we evaluated the short-term effect of alley cropping with reduced tillage on soil CO2 and N2O emissions and soil total organic carbon (TOC) in an almond orchard under Mediterranean rainfed conditions. We compared an almond monoculture with tillage in all plot surface (MC) with almond crop with reduced tillage and growth of Capparis spinosa (D1) and almond crop with reduced tillage and growth of Thymus hyemalis (D2). For two years, soil CO2 and N2O were measured, with soil sampling at the start and end of the experimental period. Results showed that CO(2 )emission rates followed the soil temperature pattern, while N2O emissions were not correlated with temperature nor moisture. Soil CO(2 )emissions were significantly higher in MC (87 mg m(-2) h(-1)), with no significant differences between D1 and D2 (69 mg m(-2) h(-1)). Some peaks in CO(2 )effluxes were observed after tillage operations during warm days. Soil N2O emission rates were not significantly different among treatments. Cumulative CO2 and CO2 equivalent (CO(2)e) emissions were significantly highest in MC. When CO(2)e emissions were expressed on a crop production basis, D2 showed the significantly lowest values (5080 g kg-1) compared to D1 (50,419 g kg-1) and MC (87,836 g kg(-1)), owing to the high thyme yield, additional to the almond yield. No production was obtained for C. spinosa, since at least two more years are required. TOC did not change with time in MC neither D1, but it significantly increased in D2 from 3.85 g kg(-1) in 2019 to 4.62 g kg(-1) in 2021. Thus, alley cropping can contribute to increase the agroecosystem productivity and reduce CO2 emissions. However, it is necessary to grow evergreen alley crops such as thyme to obtain short-term increases in soil organic matter. Thus, to estimate increases in TOC with alley cropping, the plantation density and the period required by the crop to cover most of the surface are essential factors at planning the cropping strategy.

About 90% of farm earnings rely on the cultivation of sugar, fibre, cereals and legumes. Due to lack of essential resources and technical expertise, every year thousands of farmers fail to reach maximum yield potential. Over 70% of farmers own less than 5 ha in Pakistan; therefore, it is uneconomic to employ costly mechanical and chemical strategies for the control of pests in their crops. Among these pests, we eds are considered to be the major obstacle to crop production, and can ultimately result in crop failure. Traditionally, manipulation of cropping techniques was employed for the control of weeds; later on, development of synthetic chemical herbicides made it easier to control weeds in a very short time period. However, over time the increased use of herbicides has led to the development of herbicide resistant weeds. Furthermore, increasing environmental concerns, weed population shifts, and increased managerial costs have made it difficult for farmers to control these weed species within their limited economic resources. Nowadays, scientists and research organizations are being urged to provide innovative weed management solutions, with minimal ecological impacts. Studies have revealed the importance of cultural strategies for the management of weeds in different cropping systems. Research has proved that alternation of cultural practices, and selection of competitive crop cultivars, could be a possible strategy to minimize the competitiveness of weeds. Increased crop densities, narrower row spacing, intercropping and alternation in row directions are among the weed control strategies gaining rapid attention in many countries. Unfortunately, limited information is available about weed management using crop competition in Pakistan. This review article focusses on the importance of these agronomic practices in reducing the competitive potential of weeds, for their effective and appropriate management in major crops of Pakistan. It is intended to assist researchers in the design of economically viable and eco-friendly weed management strategies, which will aid in eliminating the burden of herbicides and mechanical cultivation from farmer's production costs.

Studies involving the effect of adopting integrated systems on greenhouse gas mitigation are essential for choosing sustainable agricultural systems. In this study, the emissions of nitrous oxide in a crop-livestock system (4-year crop/pasture rotation) compared with two continuous crop (CC) areas under conventional and no-tillage management were investigated. The treatments consisted of continuous cropping under no-tillage (CC-NT), continuous cropping with annual heavy disc harrow (CC-CT), an integrated crop-livestock system under no-tillage (CLS-NT) and native Cerrado as a reference. Considering the cumulative N2O emissions in a year, the CC-CT emitted 2.55 kg N-N2O ha(-1), higher than the Cerrado, which emitted 0.55 kg N-N2O ha(-1). All the agricultural systems emitted more N2O than the Cerrado, however, the two conservation systems CC-NT and CLS-NT had lower emissions than the CC-CT, and were responsible for 1.90 and 1.52 kg N-N2O ha(-1), respectively. In the agroecosystems, the highest N2O fluxes were observed after fertilization and rainfall events. In the CC systems, N2O emissions were greater than in the integrated system during the sorghum/off-season period, but in the CC-CT emissions were greater than in CC-NT. During the soybean cycle no differences in emissions were observed between both CC systems, which surpassed that in CLS-NT that was occupied by Brachiaria pasture. The annual cumulative N2O emissions in CLS-NT were close to that observed in the Cerrado indicating this system to be an agricultural practice with potential to mitigate N2O emissions.

The addition of flowering plants within agroecosystems may provide the resources necessary to support beneficial insects at the local scale. We hypothesized that insect pollinator and natural enemy abundance would increase in cucumber (Cucumis sativus) plots containing flower strips and that the effect would be greatest in the crop rows closest to the flower strips. Three flower treatments were tested: 1) buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), 2) yellow mustard (Brassica hirta), 3) sweet alyssum (Lobularia maritima), and cucumbers as a control. Flowers were planted within a commercial cucumber field in 20-m-long strips in a randomized complete block design with six replications in the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons. Some floral treatments successfully attracted more beneficial insects than others, but the beneficials did not disperse out to the cucumber plants. Cucumber yield was unaffected by flowers with one exception: in 2015, cucumber yield in the sweet alyssum plots were greater than those in plots with no flowers. Our research indicates that adding flowers to cucumber fields to increase services from beneficial insects needs to be further investigated to better understand the effect of factors such as relative flowering strip size.

PLANT SOIL AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"allelopathy; Brassicaceae; intercropping; cropping system; competition; weed density"	"NITROGEN AVAILABILITY; FARMING SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; SOIL; GROWTH; FALL; ESTABLISHMENT; ACCUMULATION; DIVERSITY; COMMUNITY"	The weed suppressive ability of oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus var. oleiformis Pers.) cover crop is attributed to high competitiveness for resources and biochemical effects on weeds. The oilseed radish cover crop was sown in five treatments plus an untreated control over a period of five weeks before and three weeks after winter wheat harvest. Additionally, fertilization effects on oilseed radish biomass and weed suppression were measured. The highest biomass of the cover crop was observed 12 weeks after harvest (WAH) when the oilseed radish was sown one week after harvest (1 WAH) (2015) and five weeks before harvest (5 WBH) (2016). No differences of fertilization were observed concerning oilseed radish and weed biomass in 2015, whereby increased biomass was found after fertilization in 2016. The highest weed control efficacy of up to 83% and 90% was achieved in treatments 1 WAH (2015) and 5 WBH (2016) at 12 WAH. The early sowing of oilseed radish in winter wheat resulted in low germination and biomass yield within the field, due to low precipitation in 2015. Nevertheless, there is a high potential of early sown oilseed radish for higher weed control efficacy, which was demonstrated in 2016.

The present studies determined the antagonistic activity of selected bacteria of the soil environment of root chicory towards fungi pathogenic towards this plant: Alternaria alternata, Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium culrnorum, E oxysporum, Thanatephorus cucumeris and Sclerotinia sclerotiorurn. Root chicory was cultivated with using cover crops (oats, tansy phacelia and common vetch). The use of cover crops, especially oats, in the cultivation of root chicory had a positive effect both on the total population of bacteria and the population of Bacillus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. in the soil. Antagonistic Bacillus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. displayed differentiated activity towards the studied fungi. The greatest antagonistic effect was found out after the mulch of oats. After common vetch, the antagonistic activity of bacteria was more than twice, and after phacelia three times as low as after oats.

J	"Ehrmann, J; Ritz, K"				"Ehrmann, Juergen; Ritz, Karl"			Plant: soil interactions in temperate multi-cropping production systems	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Review						"Intercropping; Plant interspecific competition; Soil biotic communities; Biological weed, pest and disease control; Nutrient facilitation; Soil structure"	"WHEAT TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; INTERSPECIFIC ROOT INTERACTIONS; BIOLOGICAL NITROGEN-FIXATION; PEA PISUM-SATIVUM; ZEA-MAYS L.; WHITE CLOVER; RED-CLOVER; ALLELOPATHIC INTERACTIONS; INTERCROPPED WHEAT; PHOSPHORUS UPTAKE"	Multi-cropping approaches in production systems, where more than one crop cultivar or species are grown simultaneously, are gaining increased attention and application. Benefits can include increased production, effective pest, disease and weed control, and improved soil health. The effects of such practices on the range of interactions within the plant-soil system are manifest via plant interspecific competition, pest and disease attenuation, soil community composition and structure, nutrient cycling, and soil structural dynamics. Interplant diversity and competition effectively increases the nature and extent of root networks, tending to lead to more efficient resource use in time and space. Increased competitive ability at a system level, and allelopathic interactions, can reduce weed, pest and disease severity. Soil biotic communities are affected by plant diversity, which can increase abundance, diversity and activity of functional groups. Attendant rhizosphere-located processes can facilitate nutrient uptake between component crops. Whilst there are few studies into multi-cropping effects on soil structure, it is hypothesised that such processes are manifest particularly via the role which the belowground biota play in soil structural dynamics. A deeper understanding of eco-physiological processes affecting weed, pest and disease dynamics in the context of multiple cropping scenarios, and breeding cultivars to optimise mutualistic and allelopathic traits of crop mixtures could significantly increase productivity and adoption of more sustainable farming practices. Wider consideration needs to be given to plant: soil interactions when crop plants are grown in the context of mixtures, i.e. as communities as opposed to monotonous populations. In particular, a better understanding is required of how root systems develop in the context of mixtures and the extent to which resultant interactions with the soil biota are context-dependent. A significant challenge is that crop cultivars or production systems optimised for monocultural circumstances should not be assumed to be most suited for multi-cropping scenarios, and hence alternative strategies for developing new production systems need to take this into account.

We investigated the differences in efficacy observed in the field, by analysing the mechanisms by which a Brassica cover crop can act as a biofumigant crop in the prevention of soil-borne disease development. We hypothesised that the biofumigant crop might have a negative effect on soil-borne pathogens whilst growing, and that the pulverisation of this crop and the incorporation of its residues into the soil may enhance this effect. We tested this hypothesis by carrying out three field experiments in 2006, 2007 and 2008 in which Brassica juncea (brown mustard) was managed in different ways within a sugar beet-winter wheat rotation and analysing effects on sugar beet root rot caused by Rhizoctonia solani. Three treatments were studied: mustard pulled out at flowering (MP), mustard crushed at flowering and incorporated into the soil (MC) and bare soil (BS) as a control. We assessed the effect of each treatment on root rot incidence and severity at harvest. Over the 3 years of the experiment, disease incidence was significantly higher on BS plots than on the other plots and was significantly higher on MP plots than on MC plots. MC treatment gave a significantly lower mean conditional severity (severity calculated for diseased beets only) than the BS and MP treatments. Mustard residue incorporation was consistently effective at decreasing disease incidence from year to year (43, 44 and 47% efficacy, as determined by comparison with the disease incidence on BS plots, in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively), but the efficacy of growing mustard was variable (36, 16 and 39% efficacy in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively). These findings provide insight into the mechanisms by which biofumigant crops may affect soil-borne diseases. These findings have implications for the possible use of biofumigant crops as a biological method for controlling soil-borne diseases at the field scale. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Plant hydraulic lift of soil water - implications for crop production and land restoration	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Review						"Agroecosystems; Bioirrigation; Bioremediation; Intercropping; Phreatophytes; Reforestation"	"CHICKPEA CICER-ARIETINUM; TRINITROTOLUENE TNT; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; ROOT; GROWTH; REDISTRIBUTION; RHIZOSPHERE; PHYTOREMEDIATION; IRRIGATION; CARBON"	Water more than other factors limits growth and productivity of terrestrial plants. Strategies of plants to cope with soil drought include hydraulic redistribution of water via roots from moist to dry soil. During periods of drought, water may be transported upward through root systems from moister subsurface to dry surface soil by a process known as hydraulic lift (HL). On warm and dry days when plant transpiration peaks, hydraulically lifted water released into soil can support growth and survival of the lifting and neighboring plants. Soil and rhizosphere microorganisms and the soil fauna could also benefit from HL-derived water, which eventually increases the availability of nutrients to plants. Although HL was examined mainly in the context of terrestrial plant ecology, this biological subterranean sprinkler process may also prove to be a sustainable alternative to conventional engineered irrigation techniques currently used for agronomical purposes. Therefore, this review aims to outline and discuss potential practical application of HL for crop production, land restoration, and soil phytoremediation.

The propensity of alfalfa strips to retain lygus bugs, thereby keeping them out of cotton, and the utility of alfalfa strips as a reservoir for beneficial insects were evaluated from May to August in 1990 and 1991. The following three alfalfa cutting strategies were examined: (1) uncut alfalfa, (2) a 28-d strip-cut treatment, and (3) a 35-d strip-cut treatment. Insect populations were quantified in both the newer alfalfa growth and the older alfalfa growth of the strip-cut treatments. Lygus bug densities were significantly higher in the uncut treatment than in the other treatments, peaking at 520 per 1.9 m2 in 1990 and 350 per 1.9 m2 in 1991. Lygus bug levels in the strip-cut treatments were low in the newer alfalfa growth (averaging 41.8 per 1.9 m2) and only slightly higher in the older alfalfa growth of the 28-d strip-cut treatment (averaging 65.3 per 1.9 m2). Populations were relatively constant within these three treatments throughout the season. However, in the older growth of the 35-d cutting regime, Lygus bug populations averaged 103 per 1.9 m2. Densities of beneficial insects were also higher in the uncut than the strip-cut treatments, but the higher predator densities apparently did not offset the high Lygus bug population increase. The uncut treatment also lacked Lygus bug egg and nymphal mortality from the alfalfa cutting as compared with the strip-cut treatments. The less frequent cutting, in the 35-d compared with the 28-d treatment, probably also allowed for a buildup of the Lygus bug population. Lygus bug instar distribution, sex, and predator species were also examined in these treatments. It appears that to optimize Lygus bug management, while still producing high densities of predacious insects, strip-cut alfalfa should be used and cut on a 28-d schedule.

However, the plastic film is usually made from non-degradable polyethylene materials, which may lead to the incorporation of plastic into soils and cause a series of negative environmental effects. As such, biodegradable film mulching (BM) can represent a valuable alternative to PM. A two-year experiment was carried out during the 2014 and 2015 seasons to evaluate the effects of PM, BM, and no film mulching (NM) on the soil water balance in the corn field. The two-dimensional numerical HYDRUS-2D model was calibrated and validated using experimental data collected in 2014 and 2015, respectively, under BM, PM, and NM and then used to evaluate soil water contents (SWC), water fluxes, and soil water balances in two-dimensional soil profiles. The results of numerical simulations were in good agreement with measurements, with the mean relative errors for the calibration and validation periods for BM, PM and NM of 11.2%, 10.7%, and 11.7%, respectively. The results showed that SWCs were similar in the BM and PM scenarios during early and middle crop growth periods. Significant differences in SWCs were observed only after the average fraction of the disintegrated area of the biodegradable film was equal or higher than about 40% (during the late crop growth period). The results also showed that mulching mainly affects SWCs in the top 0-20 cm soil layer. There were significant differences in cumulative evaporation and water fluxes between different treatments, but an insignificant difference in root water uptake between PM and BM. Cumulative evaporation for BM increased by 30.5% compared to PM and decreased by 41.9% compared to NM. Corresponding cumulative water fluxes at the 80 cm depth increased and decreased by 6.6% and 48.8%, respectively. Two-dimensional simulations of soil water content distributions revealed that the water stress area in the soil profile (with SWCs lower than readily available water) before irrigation was 1.79 and 0.75 times larger for BM than for PM and NM, respectively. SWCs in the surface soil layer of BM also increased after rainfall during the late crop growth period, which improved the rainwater use efficiency by 8.2% compared to PM. Both experiments and simulations revealed that BM has more comparable soil moisture dynamics to PM than to NM.

J	Sadras, VO				Sadras, VO			The N : P stoichiometry of cereal, grain legume and oilseed crops	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Review						"multiple stresses; co-limitation; nitrogen; phytin; fertiliser; protein; yield"	"MAIZE ZEA-MAYS; MUSTARD BRASSICA-JUNCEA; SUNFLOWER HELIANTHUS-ANNUUS; WHEAT TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; NUTRIENT-UPTAKE; FARMYARD MANURE; INTERCROPPING SYSTEM; SOIL PROPERTIES; LOWLAND RICE; WATER-USE"	A data base including grain yield, nitrogen uptake (N-u) and phosphorus uptake (P-u) was compiled to investigate the N:P stoichiometry of cereal (n = 759), grain legume (n. = 413) and oilseed species (n = 421). Actual ratios and slopes of functions relating nitrogen uptake and phosphorus uptake were used to characterise N:P stoichiometry. The focus is on variability in N:P ratios of field crops, and N:P stoichiometry of crops achieving maximum yield. N:P ratios varied between similar to 20, the maximum for legumes and oilseed crops, and similar to 1.5, the minimum for cereals. By definition, N:P ratios are a direct function of N uptake and an inverse function of P uptake. The expected association between N:P ratio and N uptake was not evident except for grain legumes whereas the expected relationship between N:P and P uptake was verified for all three crop types. This highlights the role of P uptake as the main source of variability in N:P stoichiometry. The relationship between N uptake (N-u) and P uptake (P-u) for crops achieving maximum yield in each experiment was markedly non-linear. Functions of the form N-u = NmaxPu/(P-u(#) + P-u) described the way in which N:P stoichiometry scaled with grain yield. Maximum uptake of nitrogen (N-max) was similar for all three crop types (approximate to 240 ka N ha(-1)), but it was achieved via different avenues, i.e. high yield and low grain protein concentration for cereals compared to lower yield and higher grain protein concentration in oilseed and legume crops. Phosphorus uptake at half N-max (P-u(#)) ranged from 27 kg P ha(-1) for oilseeds to P-u(#) was 4.5 for oilseed crops, 5.6 for cereals and 8.7 for legumes. For cereals and 14 kg P ha(-1) for legumes. The N:P ratio at oilseeds, over 40% of crops attaining maximum yield had N:P ratios in a relatively narrow range between 4 and 6. Variation in grain protein concentration was a major source of instability in N:P ratios of legumes. Being at the base of agro-ecological food webs, the N:P stoichiometry of crops has implications for both decomposers and consumers, and stoichiometric concepts might be of interest in fertiliser management and modelling. Variability in N:P stoichiometry related to plant storage products, however, restricts its application. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Many studies have been carried out on the penetration of radiation into crops however to date, few results are available on turfgrasses, mainly due to the difficulties of introducing sensors into the turf without disturbing the natural position of the leaves. In the present research two warm season turfgrasses, hybrid bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon x transvaalensis) ' Patriot' and manilagrass (Zoysia matrella) 'Zeon', were studied. The aim was to describe their canopy architecture grown with minimal disturbance to the natural arrangement of the leaves and stems, and to determine the potential effects of canopy architecture on light penetration and reflectance. Radiometric measurements were carried out at eight different profile levels of turfgrasses that were up to 12 cm tall. A LI-COR 1800 spectroradiometer with an optical fiber cable and a 7 mm diameter sensor was used. Measurements were carried out in the 390-1100 nm region at 5 nm intervals. The LAI value was higher for the manilagrass (9.0) than for the hybrid bermudagrass (5.6). The transmitted radiation was found to be closely dependent on downward cumulative LAI. Despite a more upright habit (mean insertion angle of 22.4 degrees +/- 3.4), Zoysia matrella showed a higher NIR reflectance compared to Cdxt, which has a horizontal leaf arrangement (mean insertion angle 62.1 degrees +/- 9.6). The species studied showed substantial differences both in terms of phytometric characteristics and in the capacity to attenuate solar radiation.

However, the film residue and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) losses are the leading cause of non-point pollution in agricultural fields. To promote the development of sustainable agriculture, the HYDRUS (2D/3D) model was first calibrated and then validated using experimental data from 2016 and 2017, respectively, collected in the drip-irrigated sandy field with plastic film mulching (PFM), biodegradable film mulching (BFM), and no film mulching (NFM). Additionally, the NO3-N spatial and temporal distributions, uptake, leaching, and use efficiency (NUE) under PFM, BFM, and NFM with 280 kg ha(-1) of the N-fertilizer (the local recommendation) were evaluated using both observed and simulated data. These factors were also assessed under BFM with 210 (75 % of the recommended value) and 140 kg ha(-1) (50 % of the recommended value) of the N-fertilizer. The results of numerical simulations were in good agreement with observations, with the RMSE, R-2, and NSE during verification being 0.01-0.08 mg cm(-3), 0.62-0.87, and 0.68-0.94, respectively. When the same amount of the N-fertilizer (280 kg ha(-1)) was applied in each treatment, there were no apparent differences in NO3-N concentrations in the soil profile, cumulative NO3-N uptake by corn (CNU), and cumulative NO3-N leaching (CNL) in the 100-cm soil depth between the BFM280 and PFM280 scenarios (the subscript indicates the amount of the N-fertilizer) during the early growing season (Day After Sowing [DAS] of 0-78 in 2016 and DAS of 0-92 in 2017). However, CNU and CNL were higher, and the NO3-N concentrations in the upper soil layer (0-40 cm soil layer) lower in these two scenarios than in the NFM280 scenario. The NO3-N concentrations in the topsoil layer (the 0-20 cm soil layer) in the BFM280 scenario were 3.9 % higher than in the PFM280 scenario during DAS 93-154 in 2017 due to the disintegration of the biodegradable film and 26.3 % lower during DAS 79-155 in 2016 because of intensive rainfall. Additionally, the highest NUE (50.9 kg kg(-1), the average value for two years) was found when 75 % of the recommended N-fertilizer (210 kg ha(-1)) was applied. Therefore, an application of 210 kg ha(-1) of the N-fertilizer in the BFM scenario can be recommended for sandy farmland to avoid plastic pollution, increase NUE, and effectively promote the development of sustainable agriculture.

This study aimed to understand how the conversion of barren land to peach (Prunus persica) orchards affects soil nutrients, heavy metals, and fungal communities in the 0???40 cm profile (at 20 cm intervals) in an experiment including three treatments, barren land (BL), peach orchards planting for 4 years (Y4), and peach orchards planting for 10 years (Y10). Results of the experiment showed that compared with BL, Y4 reduced the availability of some macronutrients (N and K) and micronutrients (Fe and Mn) due to the exclusive application of chemical fertilizer at the seedling stage. Conversely, Y10, which included six years of green cultivation management, using a combination of sheep manure and chemical fertilizer as well as alfalfa (Medicago sativa Linn) intercropping, effectively improved soil macronutrients, but did not enhance the availability of Fe and Mn. Although the investigated heavy metals (As, Hg, Pb, Cr, and Cd) in both the Y4 and Y10 soils were found to pose a low risk to food safety and soil environment, Hg, Cr, and As tended to accumulate in the subsoil (20???40 cm). Furthermore, the variations in the fungal community composition and functional groups were mainly driven by the interaction effects of macronutrients, micronutrients, and heavy metals, but their independent contribution to specific key functional groups cannot be overlooked. For example, Y4 and Y10 decreased the relative abundance of soil saprotrophic and lichenized fungi, mainly due to the loss of micronutrients (Fe and Mn). However, as a result of macronutrient input and dung saprotrophic fungi enrichment, orchard soils promoted the growth of pathogens that play critical roles in fungal co-occurrence networks. These findings indicate that supplementation with N or K fertilizer or manure at the seedling stage and fertilizers rich in Fe and Mn throughout the growth period would be beneficial to the balance of soil nutrients and provide insights into linking the variations in soil nutrients and heavy metals to the function of the fungal community during the conversion of barren land to orchards in alpine soil ecosystems. The risks posed by heavy metal accumulation and fungal pathogen enrichment should be actively prevented.

Yet, the agricultural economy of the early urban centres in the region remains poorly understood. Ongoing excavations at Gabii provide a new substantial archaeobotanical dataset that allows the investigation of crop production and farming practices during the transitional period between the eighth and the sixth century BCE. This study presents a multi-proxy approach that integrates archaeobotanical data with carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses on charred cereal grains to reconstruct Gabii's crop husbandry regimes. Our results show an unexpected local combination of staples in which barley is the most common crop. No significant changes are visible throughout the period suggesting a remarkable consistency in crop selection and persistence of traditional practices. The stable nitrogen isotope analysis has revealed low values that we argue could be an indication of intercropping cereals and pulses. A drop in the water availability during the sixth century BCE could be related to a combination of environmental factors, human behaviours, and, possibly, production stress.

Cover crops can be used as a habitat management strategy to enhance the natural enemies and their temporal synchronization with a target pest. We examined the effect of winter oat intercropping within organic plum orchards on the natural enemy abundance and seasonal dynamics on the biological control of plum aphids in spring in Central Chile. Methods. We compared the incidence and abundance of natural enemies and aphid pests from winter to the end of spring using two treatments: (1) plum trees with an oat cover crop (OCC) and (2) plum trees without a cover crop but with spontaneous vegetation (SV). We hypothesized that cover crops allow the development of winter cereal aphids, promoting the early arrival of natural enemies in spring, resulting in an earlier control of plum aphids. Results. Winter cereal aphids developed well on the OCC, and as a result, a lower plum aphid incidence in spring was observed when compared to the SV. However, the abundance of natural enemies and the parasitism rates cannot explain the positive impacts of the oat cover crop on the aphid populations as there were no differences between treatments. A potential effect of the oat due to chemical and/or physical stimuli (bottom-up effects) could help to explain these results.

The objective of this study was to analyze whether the use of green manures increases soil fertility in terms of the nutrients N, P and K with low environmental risk for family agricultural production. An experiment was set up in the State of Mato Grosso (Brazil), in randomized complete block design, with a 6 x 3 factorial scheme, four replications, corresponding to 6 types of plants and 3 doses of phosphorus. Leguminous green manure plants were: velvet bean, Crotalaria juncea, Crotalaria ochroleuca and dwarf pigeon pea, in addition to plots with pearl millet and weedy fallow control. Rock phosphate (i.e., reactive natural phosphate) was applied as a source of phosphorus at 0, 50 and 100 kg P2O5 ha(-1). The species used as green manure were cut in full bloom and the levels of N, P, K and C in plants and soil were determined. Leguminous green manure plants, after mineralization, increased the stocks of N, P and K in the soil. Crotalaria juncea was the one that reached the highest N accumulation in its constitution, being recommended in the intercropping with species with C/N ratio > 30 to minimize risks of contamination with nitrate in the soil. This work concluded that the managements with green manure plants, especially Crotalaria ochroleuca, are recommended and environmentally safe technical alternatives for family farming.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the production, forage quality, and cattle performance with forages of the genus Brachiaria and Panicum maximum after intercropping with soybean in an integrated crop-livestock system and to assess the relationship between mulch biomass and soybean yield. The experimental design was completely randomised and consisted of a 4 x 5 factorial arrangement with four replicates. The treatments consisted of four forages, namely, Xaraes palisadegrass (Brachiaria brizantha cv. Xaraes), Congo grass (Brachiaria ruziziensis), Mombaca guinea grass (Panicum maximum cv. Mombaca), and Tamani guinea grass (Panicum maximum cv. BRS Tamani), intercropped with oversown soybean, and these treatments were evaluated over five grazing cycles. The results showed that Mombaca guinea grass and Xaraes palisadegrass were associated with higher forage production, but the highest forage quality was obtained with Tamani guinea grass. Mombaca guinea grass, Xaraes palisadegrass, and Tamani guinea grass resulted in the best pasture performance of animals under grazing in the off-season and thus generated more benefits in terms of the soybean yield. Congo grass was associated with reduced production, lower forage quality and decreased animal production during the grazing cycles. The pasture establishment through soybean over sowing proved to be an efficient technique that reduced the environmental impact of livestock, because of the greater use of soil nutrients and resulted in greater sustainability.

The acidic nature of red soil commonly found in tea plantations provides unique niches for bacterial growth. These bacteria as well as soil properties are dynamic and vary with agricultural management practices. However, less is known about the influence of manipulation such as cover cropping on bacterial communities in tea plantations. In this study a field trial was conducted to address the short-term effects of soybean intercropping on a bacterial community. Diversity, metabolic potential and structure of the bacterial community were determined through community level physiological profiling and amplicon sequencing approaches. Cover cropping was observed to increase soil EC, available P, K, and microelements Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn after three months of cultivation. Bacterial functional diversity and metabolic potential toward six carbon source categories also increased in response to cover cropping. Distinct bacterial communities among treatments were revealed, and the most effective biomarkers, such as Acidobacteriaceae, Burkholderiaceae, Rhodanobacteraceae, and Sphingomonadaceae, were identified in cover cropping. Members belonging to these families are considered as organic matter decomposers and/or plant growth promoting bacteria. We provided the first evidence that cover cropping boosted both copiotrophs (Proteobacteria) and oligotrophs (Acidobacteria), with potentially increased functional stability, facilitated nutrient cycling, and prospective benefits to plants in the tea plantation.

This study aims at estimating rainfall-runoff, soil and nutrient losses from different cover crops, and to identify the best cover for checking soil loss. The study is conducted for 2013-2015 in research farm of the Central Arid Zone Research Institute, Regional Station, Bhuj, Gujarat, India. Ten treatments comprising four sole-crop, that is, sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), green gram (Vigna radiata), and cluster bean (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba) and four cereal-legume intercropping with two controls (cultivated and unplowed fallows) are undertaken in randomized block design with three replications. Multi-slot divisors are fabricated and installed. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is performed, and their interrelationships are explored. The highest soil loss is recorded from cultivated fallow (108.03 +/- 49.95 kg.ha(-1).yr(-1)) and unplowed fallow (78.95 +/- 28.42 kg.ha(-1). yr(-1)). Green gram is found effective in controlling soil loss as sole-crop (event-wise soil loss similar to 0.54-33.94 kg.ha(-1)) as well as intercropping with sorghum (event-wise soil loss similar to 0.60-23.37 kg.ha(-1)) and pearl millet (eventwise soil loss similar to 2.45-31.11 kg.ha(-1)). ANOVA revealed significance (p < .05) of runoff-generating rainfall, crop cover, and their sole- and intercropping practices. Values of coefficient of determination (R-2) indicated highly corre- lated (R-2 >= 0.75) relationships of rainfall-runoff for all treatments, rainfall-soil loss for sole cereals and cultivated fallow, and runoff-soil loss for pearl millet and intercropping with green gram. This study concludes that cereal-legume intercropping diminishes the adverse impact of raindrops on soil erosion and crop production.

AGRONOMY-BASEL			English	Article						"winter cover crop; CH4; N2O; paddy soil"		Cover crop management during the fallow season may play a relevant role in improving crop productivity and soil quality, by increasing nitrogen (N) and soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation, but has the possibility of increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the soil. A year-long consistency experiment was conducted to examine the effects of various winter covering crops on annual nitrous oxide (N2O) together with methane (CH4) emissions in the mono-rice planting system, including direct emissions in the cover crop period and the effects of incorporating these crops on gaseous emissions during the forthcoming rice (Oryza Sativa L.) growing period, to improve the development of winter fallow paddy field with covering crops and to assess rice cultivation patterns. The experiment included three treatments: Chinese milk vetch-rice (Astragalus sinicus L.) with cover crop residue returned (T1), ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.)-rice with cover crop residue returned (T2), and rice with winter fallow (CK). Compared with CK, the two winter cover crop treatments significantly increased rice yield, soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) by 6.9-14.5%, 0.8-2.1% and 3.4-5.4%, respectively. In all cases, the fluxes of CH4 and N2O could increase with the incorporation of N fertilizer application and cover crop residues. Short-term peaks of these two gas fluxes were monitored after all crop residues were incorporated in the soil preparation period, the early vegetative growth period and the midseason drainage period. The winter cover crop residue application greatly enhanced CH4 and N2O cumulative emissions compared with CK (by 193.6-226.5% and 37.5-43.7%, respectively) during rice growing season and intercropping period. Meanwhile, the mean values of global warming potentials (GWPs) from paddy fields with different cropping crops were T2 > T1 > CK. Considering the advantages of crop productivity together with environmental safety and soil quality, Chinese milk vetch-rice with cover crop residue returned would be the most practicable and sustainable cultivation pattern for the mono-rice cropping systems.

Here, the effects of soil and water conservation measures on soil microbial community structures, biodiversity, and co-occurrence networks are investigated and compared. We sampled soils at three different depths (0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-40 cm) in a citrus orchard that uses long-term soil and water conservation measures, which includes Bermuda grass strip intercropping (BS), Bermuda grass full coverage (BF), Radish-soybean crop rotation strip intercropping (RS) and clear tillage orchards (CT). Results demonstrated that BS and BF yields a significant increase in bacterial richness and diversity of fungal in soils, while BF contains more beneficial microbial taxa, especially those with degrading and nutrient cycling capabilities. Microbial community structures differed significantly among the applied measures. In addition, co-occurrence networks under BS, BF and RS were more complex and robust than that of CT, and the stability of the network in BF was the highest. Microbial interactive stability and potential interactions in bacterial networks were stronger than those of fungi. The distribution of dominant phyla showed that Chloroflexi and Ascomycota dominated the different soil and water conservation measures. Proteobacteria and Ascomycota are revealed to be keystone species in bacterial networks and fungal networks, respectively, while Proteobacteria was the keystone species in microbial networks. Though the relative abundance of Chloroflexi turned out to have increased among the four measures, the relative abundance for Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria all decreased along the soil profile, with Acidobacteria under BS to be an exception. Soils under BS and BF had higher total nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon and organic carbon than CT and RS. Organic carbon(C) and total nitrogen(N) in soil were the major drivers of these bacterial community patterns, while there was no significant correlation between them and fungi. Overall, BF increases soil nutrients and microbial diversity, and also promotes ecological stability and interrelations among microbial taxa that collectively improve soil quality in the citrus orchard studied. Therefore, we recommended BF to be an ideal application for citrus orchards of southeast China.

The study investigated farmer adaptation strategies to the effect of climate change on yam production in Kogi State with the specific objectives of assessing the socio-economic characteristics of farmers, farmers' climate related constraints, the adaptation strategies employed by farmers, and yam farmers' level of knowledge on climate change. A multistage sampling technique was used to select one hundred and twenty respondents from the different communities selected in the study area in year 2019. Data were collected through structured interview schedule. The data were analysed using frequency counts, percentages and Pearson Product Moment Correlation. Results obtained showed that farmers in the study area were mostly males with a mean age of 44.5 years. Most of the yam farmers in Kogi State got information on climate change from other farmers (77.3%) and (81.3%) of the respondents aware of climate change. Furthermore, the major effects of climate change as identified by the respondents were pest infestation (90.8%) and high rate weed growth (88.3%). Various strategies adopted by yam farmers include mulching (Mean=5.0), intercropping yam with other crops (Mean=4.5), use of weather-resistant variety (Mean=4.1) and use of early maturing crop varieties (Mean=3.8). Pearson product moment correlation shows that there is a significant relationship between estimated annual (r = 0.887), income farming experience (r = 0.274) and the farmers' level of awareness. Therefore, efforts should be made towards developing and making available, yam seeds and yam tubers that can adapt to the change in climate and weather elements like flood and drought. These findings suggest the need for more training on climate change, the adaptation methods, environmental education and sustainability of yam cropping.

Nevertheless, responses of crop plants to combined shade and drought stress are unique as compared to those of individually occurring stress which urges need to study and identify distinctions, commonalities, and the interaction between responses of plants to these concurrent stress factors. In the present review, we outlined currently available knowledge on responses of plants to shade and drought stress on a shared as well as the unique basis and tried to find a common thread potentially underlying these responses. Then, we briefly described some plausible mitigation strategies to cope with these stresses along with future perspectives. A deeper insight into plant responses to co-occurring shade and drought stress will help us to generate crops with broad-spectrum stress tolerance and increased resilience to such stresses in high planting densities or intercropping systems, thus, ensuring food security.

However, the reduced light availability under banana canopies constrains the success of the intercrop in banana systems. Determining a balance between the optimal spacing/densities of banana plants with optimized intercrop selection based on their sensitivity and tolerance to shade is imperative. This study, through extensive field experiments performed in South Kivu, DR Congo investigated the resilience of a wide range of food and forage crops to varying banana shade levels. The same crop species grown as monocrops served as controls. Quantitative yield assessments showed yam, sweet potato, ginger and forage grasses to have a good potential to grow under moderately dense to dense banana fields. Taro, soybean, mucuna, chili, eggplant, and Crotalaria sp. performed well in sparsely spaced banana fields with moderate shading. Cassava and soybean showed limited tolerance to shade. Intercropping in banana systems is also generally confined to the rainy seasons due to the high sensitivity of most annual intercrops to long dry weather in the dry season months. We also thus assessed the sensitivity of chickpea and mucuna to the long dry weather of the dry seasons and found them to have great potential for extending farming production into the dry season. Overall, we show that careful selection and allocation of crops with varying sensitivity to various banana shade levels and dry season weather can potentially increase whole field productivity.

For this purpose, seedlings of these two species were cultivated in complete nutrient solution with or without iron. The biomass production, iron status, phytosiderophores and organic acids release by roots were studied. The results demonstrated that Polypogon monspenliensis was relatively more tolerant to iron deficiency than Hordeum vulgare. Polypogon monspenliensis had the ability to secrete a higher amount of phytosiderophores and organic acids, especially citric, acetic, oxalic and malic acids, compared to Hordeum vulgare.

Interspecific grafting between Gossypium hirsutum, G. barbadense and G. herbaceum lines	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							"COTTON; RESISTANCE; RECOVERY; SHOOT; ROOT; ROOTSTOCK; MOBILE; PLANTS; RNAS"	Seedling grafting could provide additional crop improvement strategies for cotton. However, there existed limited studies on interspecific grafting and approaches. Four different grafting approaches were developed and compared between lines representing three of the four cultivated cotton species G. hirsutum, G. barbadense and G. herbaceum. Grafting approaches of this study focused on the cotyledon node and cotyledon leaves retained on scions, rootstocks, without cotyledon node and cotyledon leaves on scions and rootstocks or halved cotyledon node and single cotyledon leaf on scions and rootstocks. Evaluations of the grafting approaches were made by comparing survival and growth rate during the second and fifth weeks after transplantation, respectively. The formation of any lateral shoots at the grafted sites were studied in two of four grafting approaches in the first and the second year during flowering stage. DNA alterations due to grafting were investigated using microsatellite markers. There were no statistically significant differences between grafts and their control in survival rate and locus specific DNA alteration. Growth rate and lateral shoot formation, on the other hand, were different among grafting types and grafts. We concluded that grafting without cotyledon node and cotyledon leaves on rootstocks, and with cotyledon node but without cotyledon leaves on scions were easy to perform and suitable for interspecific cotton grafting. Results suggested that grafting seedlings and allowing time to heal graft wounds prior to spring transplanting or double cropping is suitable for wheat-cotton intercropping to prevent late or early chilling damage associated with seed sowing or conventional transplanting of susceptible seedlings. Furthermore, the rapid and consistent wound healing in seedling grafts along with lateral shoot formation occurring in two of four grafting approaches make them a suitable approach to investigate possible genetic and epigenetic movement between scions and rootstocks, especially across species.

To expand our understanding in this area, day-lily (Hemerocallis citrina) was selected to research the effect of hedgerows built on sloped red-soil farmland in southern China. In situ observations of runoff and soil loss from 2012 to 2018 were recorded in triplicate for two treatments: (1) conventional downslope-ridge tillage (CT) and (2) hedgerow intercropping with downslope-ridge tillage (HT). Micro-topography, soil nutrient content, and crop yield changes in the study plots were recorded. Hedgerows began intercepting runoff and soil loss simultaneously from the second year after they were planted, reducing annual surface runoff (35-66%) and annual erosive sediment (32-87%). As hedgerows became established, they provided increasing positive effects on soil and water conservation. However, those beneficial effects were gradually obscured by changes in micro-topography. The presence of the hedgerow had no obvious influence on soil total nutrient contents under this experimental condition. On average, planting the hedgerow reduced peanut yield by 21% but reduced rapeseed yield only by 2%. Compared with CT treatment, the average economic output of HT treatment after reaching the hedge's initial production was 1.52 times greater, showing a quadratic trend and reaching a maximum about 4 years after construction by regression. These findings indicate that hedgerow management could be optimized according to the desired beneficial soil and water conservation or crop yield characteristics in different developmental phases.

Examining the bacterial community harboringphoDgene under different long-term cropping systems may supply meaningful insights for improving soil P availability. Here, we analyzed how the cropping systems affect community structure ofphoD-harboring bacteria by changing physicochemical properties in red soils. Materials and methods Twenty-four soil samples from eight cropping systems (abandoned farmland, corn continuous cropping, mango continuous cropping, taro continuous cropping, zucchini-corn rotation, pea-corn rotation, canola-tobacco rotation, and walnut-tobacco intercropping for > 10 years) were collected from 0 to 20 cm depth in Miyi County, Sichuan Province, China. The abundance ofphoDgene was determined by quantitative PCR, andphoD-harboring bacterial community structure was analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. Results and discussion Available P concentration andphoDabundance were the highest in pea-corn rotation soil, while alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was the lowest in this soil. Available P showed a significant positive relationship withphoDabundance, while a negative relationship with ALP activity. Moreover, the dominant phyla ofphoD-harboring bacterial community were Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, withCupriavidusandBradyrhizobiumbeing the dominant genera. The relative abundances ofStreptomyces,Pseudomonas, andAmycolatopsiswere positively related to soil P concentration (total and available P) and negatively related to ALP activity, indicating that these genera may be essential in the mineralization of soil organic P. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that ALP, soil organic carbon (SOC), and N:P ratio were the remarkable factors affecting the structure ofphoD-containing bacterial community across all cropping system soils. Meanwhile, structural equation model (SEM) showed that the effects of total N and available P on soilphoD-harboring bacterial community structure were stronger than that of SOC. Further, soil texture was also one of the main factors affecting thephoD-harboring bacterial community structure, which had a notable up-regulation effect on abundance and diversity ofphoDgene and indirectly regulate gene composition by affecting available P. Conclusions The long-term cropping systems can affect the community structure ofphoD-containing bacteria and ALP activity by altering physicochemical properties, and thus contribute to regulation of the biogeochemical cycle of P in red soils. The main factors driving the changes inphoD-harboring bacterial community structure were soil texture, SOC, total N, and available P.

There were five treatment combinations, i.e sole pomegranate, pomegranate + (fenugreek-clusterbean), pomegranate + (wheat-groundnut), sole fenugreek -clusterbean and sole wheat-groundnut. Pomegranate planted at 4m x 3m was maintained with drip and intercrops with mini-sprinkler irrigation system. Intercrops showed positive effect on height, girth and canopy spread of pomegranate over sole plantation. In agri-horti systems, the productivity of fenugreek, wheat, clusterbean and groundnut were higher by 20.5, 15.1, 16.4 and 14.9 %, respectively in grain and 18.0, 15.0, 31.6 and 12.4 %, respectively in straw/stover, as compared to sole cropping. The increase in productivity in agri-horti systems may compensate the area sacrificed by canopy coverage of trees up to some extent. Wheat-groundnut intercropped with pomegranate produced higher system productivity (5376 kg /ha) over fenugreek-clusterbean intercropped with pomegranate as well as sole fenugreek-clusterbean. Water productivity of sole orchard can be improved to 0.21 and 0.39 kg /m(3) in tenns of economic yield (WPEY), 0.64 and 0.99 kg/m(3) in terms of biological yield (WPBY) and (sic) 108.8 and (sic) 151.1 /ha/mm, respectively in monitory terms by incorporating fenugreek-clusterbean and wheat-groundnut intercropping systems, respectively.

This study determined the quality status of soils under different land-use categories (i.e. agricultural crop land, orchard land and natural uncultivated land) and different land-use types (i.e. sugarcane, fodder and rice-wheat fields, intercropped and non-intercropped citrus and guava orchards, natural grassland, bare land and wetland peripheries) using population abundance and dynamics of edaphic springtails (collembola) and mites (acari) as bioindicators. Using metallic soil corer (10 cm length and 10 cm diameter), extensive random soil sampling was carried out from selected localities in district Sargodha (Punjab, Pakistan) and soil microarthropods (i.e. springtails and mites) were extracted from composite soil samples using Tullgren-Berlese funnel. Impact of collection seasons (i.e. spring, summer, autumn and winter) and impact of different land-use types or categories on the population abundance of soil microartbropods was assessed. Moreover, soil physico-chemical and microbiological properties were also determined in order to find out the main edaphic drivers which can explain the population dynamics of these microarthropods. Results revealed that all major factors i.e. land-use types and categories, collection seasons and soil properties had a significant impact on the population abundance of springtails and mites. Agricultural soils harbored maximum abundance of both microarthropods followed by orchard land-use types, while minimum arthropod abundance was recorded for soils under natural land-use types. Similarly, maximum and minimum arthropod captures were recorded during spring and autumn seasons, respectively. Moreover, population dynamics of springtails and mites had a significant positive correlation with organic matter and total organic carbon contents, while had a significant negative correlation with soil bulk density. Conclusively, this study demonstrates the differential impact of land-use, season and soil conditions on the population abundance of edaphic microarthropods suggesting their suitability to be used as bioindicators of prevailing soil status.

Modelling movement and stage-specific habitat preferences of a polyphagous insect pest	MOVEMENT ECOLOGY			English	Article						"Parent-offspring conflict; Cellular automata; Crop calendar; Insect pest dynamics; Pest control"	"DIABROTICA-SPECIOSA COLEOPTERA; HOST CHOICE; CHRYSOMELIDAE; DIVERSITY; HERBIVORES"	Background The feeding preferences of Diabrotica speciosa (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) cause a parent-offspring conflict, as providing the best host for the offspring development is detrimental to adult survival and fecundity. Understanding the implications of this conflict could help entomologists to implement pest-management programs. With this in mind, the foraging behaviour of D. speciosa was investigated using an individual-based model in two distinct scenarios. Methods In an intercropping scenario, parent-offspring conflict was simulated when adult insects exploit two crops (corn and soybean) that provide different nutritional advantages for each insect stage. First, we compared three hypothetical types of adult dispersal, considering a continuous oviposition over time: diffusion, attracted to a fixed host and alternating the preference between hosts with frequency 1 tau, where tau is the time in days spent foraging for each host. We also simulated two principles: mother knows best (adult females foraging for corn during the oviposition period) and optimal bad motherhood (adult females remain foraging for soybean to maximise their own fitness during the oviposition period), but considering the existence of a pre-oviposition period. In a landscape scenario, we investigated the population dynamics in an area composed by 4 crop plots that change over time. Results Among dispersal types considering continuous oviposition, the crop-alternating movement a-3 performed best, when close to an optimal tau. Additionally, tau was predicted to be influenced mainly by the width of crop rows. We also verified that the mother knows best strategy is better for the population growth than the optimal bad motherhood. In the landscape scenario, we observed that including fallow periods in the crop calendar and adopting a more-heterogeneous arrangement of crop plots reduced the density of this insect. Conclusion Both the continuous and sequential oviposition simulations indicate that foraging involving switching of target crop benefits population fitness. In the landscape scenario, arranging crop plots more heterogeneously and avoiding vast areas of soybean can help farmers to control this insect pest. Additionally, fallow periods can also reduce significantly D. speciosa populations.

Despite the emphasis of the role of the phytohormone ethylene in the plant physiological response to heterospecific neighbour detection, less is known about how this activated signal mediates focal plant rhizosphere microbiota to enhance plant fitness. Here, using 3 years of peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), a legume, and cyanide-containing cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) intercropping and peanut monocropping field, pot and hydroponic experiments in addition to exogenous ethylene application and soil incubation experiments, we found that ethylene, a cyanide-derived signal, is associated with the chemical identification of neighbouring cassava and the microbial re-assemblage in the peanut rhizosphere. Results Ethylene production in peanut roots can be triggered by cyanide production of neighbouring cassava plants. This gaseous signal alters the microbial composition and re-assembles the microbial co-occurrence network of peanut by shifting the abundance of an actinobacterial species, Catenulispora sp., which becomes a keystone in the intercropped peanut rhizosphere. The re-assembled rhizosphere microbiota provide more available nutrients to peanut roots and support seed production. Conclusions Our findings suggest that root ethylene acts as a signal with a dual role. It plays a role in perceiving biochemical cues from interspecific neighbours, and also has a regulatory function in mediating the rhizosphere microbial assembly, thereby enhancing focal plant fitness by improving seed production. This discovery provides a promising direction to develop novel intercropping strategies for targeted manipulations of the rhizosphere microbiome through phytohormone signals.

Qualitative traits of the meat of Nellore steers supplemented with energy and protein in an integrated crop-livestock system	ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE			English	Article						"marbling; shearing force; zebu"	"FATTY-ACID PROFILE; 4 GENETIC GROUPS; CARCASS CHARACTERISTICS; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; FED DIETS; BULLS; MILK; PERFORMANCE; TENDERNESS; SUNFLOWER"	Context Santa Fe is a model of integrated crop-livestock system in which grain crops and grasses are grown intercropped. After crop harvest, the pastures are grazed in the dry season and, after that, accumulate straw for no-till systems. In this way, protein and energy supplementation can contribute to finish steers on pastures, attending to the increasing demand from internal and external markets for sustainable high-quality red meat. Aim The present study evaluated physical and chemical composition of the Longissimus dorsi meat of Nellore steers fed with increasing levels of energy and protein supplementation on Brachiaria ruziziensis pasture in Santa Fe integrated crop-livestock system. Methods Forty chemically castrated steers were randomly assigned into four groups under a completely randomised design. Each group was supplemented one of four levels of a concentrate containing 17% crude protein and 75% of total digestible nutrients, at 0.98, 1.45, 1.86 and 2.02 kg/animal.day, representing 0.23%, 0.34%, 0.44% and 0.47% of bodyweight respectively. The experiment lasted 105 days, with trough supplementation once a day. Key results As energy and protein increased in the diet, cooking loss decreased (P = 0.01) linearly and shearing force decreased quadratically (P = 0.02), with a strong correlation between them (r = 0.93). Subcutaneous fat thickness showed a quadratic increase (P = 0.03), with its maximum point at the concentrate supplementation level of 1.55 kg/animal.day, with a thickness of 3.36 cm and a high Pearson's correlation with the loin eye area (r = 0.94). There was a quadratic increase in C18:2n6 (P = 0.05) and a linear increase in C22:6n3 (P = 0.04) polyunsaturated fatty acids. The fatty acids of the omega 3 series increased indifferently to the total fat and saturated fatty acids. Conclusions Supplementing Nellore steers with energy and protein in this integrated crop-livestock system improved meat quality, as indicated by tenderness and marbling, and changed the fatty acid profile in a way that would be more attractive to consumers. Implications. The results of the experiment will guide ruminant nutritionists to define a supplement plan for finishing steers in Santa Fe integrated crop-livestock systems targeting healthier, high-quality, and sustainable meat markets.

Appraisal of crop production in agri-horti-silvicultural system under arid-irrigated conditions of Punjab	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						"Agri-horti-silviculture; Agronomic crops; Fruit crops; Inter-cropping; Poplar; Yield"	ECONOMICS	In agri-horti-silvicultural model, the growth, yield and economic appraisal of intercropping of moong-chickpea rotation and turmeric was studied during 2014-18 under arid-irrigated conditions of Punjab. The model comprising one silvicultural crop (poplar), fruit crops (peach, plum, guava and citrus) and agronomic crops (moong-chickpea rotation and turmeric) were evaluated in different combinations. The moong- chickpea rotation and turmeric were also cultivated as sole crops for comparative analysis. The results revealed that the yield of all agronomic crops was the maximum under sole cropping leading to B:C ratio of 2.30 and 2.39 in moong-chickpea rotation and turmeric respectively followed by intercropping in poplar. Among different agri-silvi-horti combinations, the B:C ratio in system including deciduous fruit plants such as peach and plum was better as compared to evergreen fruit plants of guava and citrus. Cultivation of turmeric under different combinations was more beneficial than moong-chickpea crop rotation. Thus, it was concluded that during pre-bearing phase of fruit plants and before economic growth of poplar, the cultivation of turmeric is more profitable in agri-horti-silvicultural model. This model has potential for higher productivity of different crops in addition to natural resource conservation, efficient use of land and other resources.	"[Brar, J.

WEEDS BIOMASS AS AFFECTED BY TILLAGE PRACTICES AND CROPPING SYSTEMS UNDER A SEMIARID ENVIRONMENT	PLANTA DANINHA			English	Article						"tillage; cropping systems; weeds; biomass; semiarid"		Tillage practice has a significant role on weeds eradication and soil water conservation in crop production. Under semiarid agriculture, the monsoon rains (65%) are major source of water in Potohar, Pakistan, which can effectively be used mostly for winter crops production. To evaluate the impact of different tillage system for prevailing cropping systems and their weeds biomass under semiarid conditions, field experiment was conducted at the Arid University Research Farm Koont Rawalpindi (Pakistan) during crop growth seasons 2013-14 and 2014-15. Tillage systems as treatments were (a) three cultivations with a cultivator, as control treatment, (b) mold-board with two cultivations, (c) chisel-plough with two cultivations and (d) minimum tillage (only tillage performed at sowing time) with glyphosate. Sowing was made using drill for all cropping systems i.e. a, b, and d except c which was planted on bed (made by bed planter). In addition to ploughing treatments, different cropping systems (a) wheat - fallow (b) wheat and brassica - fallow, (c) wheat and chickpea fallow and (d) wheat - cluster bean (green manure crop) were also used for minimum two years rotations. On average in both study years, interactive effect of treatments (mold board with 2 cultivations) for the rotation wheat and brassica - fallow showed a reduction in weeds dry biomass of Anagallis arvensis (blue pimpernel, 55.6%), Asphodelus tenuifolius (jungle onion, 42.3%), Chenopodium album (common goosefoot, 40.8%), Circium arvense (creeping thistle, 53.1%), Convolvulus arvensis (field bind weed, 56.6%) and Cynodon dactylon (vilfa stellata, 45.8%) within 60 days after sowing (DAS) as compared with the control treatment (three cultivations on a wheat - fallow cropping system).

Results of the experiment showed that better weed biomass suppression can be achieved by using moldboard plough for cultivation with followed by wheat-brassica cropping system and/or wheat - chickpea intercropping for semiarid soil condition in Pakistan.

THE EFFECTS OF TILLAGE PRACTICES ON INTERRILL EROSION IN THE RED SOIL REGION OF CHINA	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						"Interrill erodibility; Interrill erosion; Rainfall simulation; Red soil region; Tillage practices"	"AGGREGATE STABILITY; RAINFALL INTENSITY; FLOW DISCHARGE; PARTICLE-SIZE; INFILTRATION; ERODIBILITY; RUNOFF; WATER; DETACHMENT; SIMULATOR"	Tillage practices have been adopted extensively to control runoff and soil loss from croplands. To quantify the effects of tillage practices on erosion processes in interrill areas, microplot rainfall simulation experiments were conducted in peanut fields with five tillage practices in the red soil region of China. The results showed that conservation tillage practices, including straw mulch cover (PC), manure fertilizer (PM), and peanut-orange intercropping (PO), could significantly conserve water and reduce soil loss rates by more than 50% compared with traditional furrow (PF) and peanut-radish rotation (PR) treatments. The variations in the hydrologic and soil loss indexes among the treatments were larger in the dry run tests than in the wet run tests. Accordingly, the efficiencies of the conservation practices in reducing soil loss were reflected mainly under a high rainfall intensity or low soil moisture in this study. Additionally, the runoff generation indexes were significantly correlated with the soil loss rate in all five treatments. The measured interrill erodibility was highest in the PR treatment (944,124 kg s(-1) m(-4)) and lowest in the PO and PM treatments (571,797 and 584,238 kg s(-1) m(-4), respectively), as the organic matter content and aggregate stability were relatively high in the two conservation treatments. Influenced by the dynamics of loose materials and possible surface sealing, the interrill erodibility was relatively high and decreased with the final infiltration rate when measured under the dry run conditions. These results could guide cropland soil management and improve process-based erosion models.

However, the supply of bioavailable P for crop plants is insufficient due to the strong adsorption and fixing behaviors in red soils. In this study, we explored P adsorption and desorption characteristics in red soils under different long-term cropping systems. We also analyzed how the cropping systems affect P adsorption and desorption through changing soil physicochemical properties under the experimental conditions. Materials and methods Eighteen red soil samples were collected at depths of 0-20 cm from six cropping systems (abandoned farmland, corn continuous cropping, taro continuous cropping, pea-corn rotation, canola-tobacco rotation, and walnut-tobacco intercropping for at least 10 years) in Miyi County, Sichuan Province, China. Soil physicochemical properties, zeta potentials, and P adsorption and desorption characteristics were evaluated. Results and discussion The P adsorption capacity of soils increased at a decreasing rate with increasing exogenous P concentration, while the P desorption capacity increased constantly; however, the change in the percentage of desorbed P had no clear trend. The soils under pea-corn rotation and taro continuous cropping had lower P adsorption capacities and higher P desorption capacities compared to those under the other cropping systems. The maximum P adsorption capacities (Q(m)) of pea-corn rotation and taro continuous cropping soils were 16.1% and 32.4% of abandoned farmland soil, while the corresponding desorption coefficients were 6.93 and 1.62 times higher than that of abandoned farmland soil, respectively. Soil available P (AP), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and clay content were positively correlated with a and readily desorbable P (RDP), while they were negatively correlated with Q(m) (P < 0.05); opposite trends were found in the sand content. In addition, the zeta potential of soil colloids decreased with increasing soil pH. Among the cropping systems, the absolute value of zeta potential was lowest for tobacco-walnut intercropping, while its isoelectric point was the highest, resulting in the highest P adsorption capacity. Conclusions The long-term cropping systems affect P adsorption and desorption characteristics and P availability in red soils by influencing soil physicochemical properties. The main factors driving the changes in P adsorption behavior were AP, CEC, free Fe oxides, and sand content, while AP, sand, and clay contents were the major factors for the P desorption."

In this research, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by some CPs were investigated for their repellent properties towards the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae Sulzer). The aim of this study was to understand the modes of action involved: direct effects on the aphid and/or indirect effects via the host plant (pepper, Capsicum annuum L.). RESULTS We identified two promising repellent CP species: the volatile blend from basil (Ocimum basilicum, direct repellent effect) and the mixture of (or previously intercropped) C. annuum plants with Tagetes patula cv. Nana (indirect effect). This effect was cultivar-dependent and linked to the volatile bouquet. For the 16 compounds present in the O. basilicum or T. patula bouquets tested individually, (E)-beta-farnesene, and eugenol reported good repellent properties against M. persicae. Other compounds were repellent at medium and/or highest concentrations. Thus, the presence of repellent VOCs in a mixture does not mean that it has a repellent propriety. CONCLUSION We identified two promising repellent CP species towards M. persicae, with a likely effect of one CP's VOCs on the host plant repellency and highlighted the specific effectiveness of VOC blends.

An experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of cropping patterns on Pi concentrations in soil aggregates from the 0-10 cm depth in northwest China. The three cropping patterns were as follows: continuous cotton (CC), corn-wheat rotation (CW), and tree-cotton intercropping (TC). The results showed that more than 89% of the soil mass was in the macroaggregates (> 0.25 mm) in all cropping patterns, indicating a good soil structure in the study area. Total Pi and available P concentrations were significantly higher in the < 0.053 mm aggregate size class than in other classes (p < 0.05). As the dominant component, the Ca-10-P accounted for 48.0-53.8% of total soil Pi. The Ca-10-P concentrations decreased in the order CC > TC > CW. Additionally, the O-P concentrations were enriched in the CC treatment. But, the Ca-g-P, Al-P and Fe-P concentrations were significantly greater in CW and TC than in CC. These results suggested that continuous cotton production leads to plant available Pi (Ca-g-P, Al-P, and Fe-P) convert into unavailable Pi forms (Ca-10-P and O-P). The TC system had the greatest contribution to total P in > 0.25 mm aggregates (p < 0.05), suggesting TC had a greater capacity to supply soil P. TC may be an appropriate fanning practice for maximum availability of P in arid farmland ecosystems.

Sustainability strategies and soil fertility in the dryland Binh Thuan, Vietnam	SPANISH JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article						"Agriculture; land degradation; Arenosols; desertification"	"DESERTIFICATION; CARBON"	Land degradation caused by both human impact and climatic factors leads to desertification and results in a reduction of the vegetation cover, erosion and a loss of soil fertility followed by socioeconomic problems. In particular, non-adjusted land use practices are the main driving forces for desertification. The present study examines how sustainability strategies under dragon fruit and peanut cultivation in Binh Thuan, Vietnam, influence soil fertility in a region that is characterised by Arenosols and a semi-arid climate. The coastal area is prone to desertification which complicates agricultural production. For that purpose, soil analyses for various soil parameters were combined with a socio-scientific survey based on the evaluation of quantitative interviews and a SWOT analysis. The results indicate that no significant effects of sustainability strategies on soil fertility could be measured. Furthermore, no evidence was found that intercropping enhances soil fertility, since soil parameters were not higher under dragon fruit intercropped with peanut than under monoculture. A higher nutrient concentration directly next to the dragon fruit shows that dragon fruit cultivation contributes more to soil fertility than peanut cultivation. This is especially because of the application of mulch around the plant which increases the humus content in soil and keeps the nutrients from leaching. However, the non-cultivated area in between the dragon fruit is more exposed to soil erosion. Differences in values next to and in between the plants are higher under dragon fruit. Therefore, it can be assumed that under peanut, nutrient concentrations are more balanced over the whole field. Due to a rising demand for food and pressure on land not yet used for agriculture, further research on Arenosols and the implementation of agricultural practices adapted to environmental conditions should be accelerated in order to achieve the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals).

This study aimed to identify the main phenolic compounds with allelopathic potential in the shoot of rye (Secale cereale L.) and oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus L.) cover crops, as well as evaluate whether the cultivation system and phonological stage may influence secondary metabolite production and weed emergence. Samples of the shoot of these cover crops were collected at 60, 80, and 100 days after sowing (DAS) and 15 and 30 days after lodging (DAL) under field conditions. Weed emergence was evaluated at 45, 75, and 100 DAL of cover crops. The main compounds in rye were 6-methoxy-2-benzoxazolinone (MBOA) and 2-benzoxazolinone (BOA) under monocropping and intercropping, while flavonoid quercetin was found in oilseed radish at all evaluated times. During the growing cycle, the highest contents of phenolic compounds were found at the elongation stage (60 DAS) of rye under monocropping and intercropping systems (9.33 and 8.22 mg g(-1) DM, respectively) and at grain filling stage (100 DAS) for oilseed radish intercropped with rye and black oat (3.24 and 3.83 mg g(-1) DM, respectively). No differences were found in the contents of the main compounds when the species was grown under monocropping or intercropping systems. A reduction in the contents of MBOA, BOA, and quercetin was observed after lodging. Weed dry matter production was lower at 45 DAL in all treatments with rye and oilseed radish residues when compared to the control. The intercropping of lye with oilseed radish is an alternative management for weed control in agroccological systems due to the physical barrier created by these species and the presence of phenolic compounds with allelopathic potential.

The accessions, derived from collections of the Department of Agriculture and Food Western Australia and the International Research Center for Agriculture in Dry Areas, were propagated in the greenhouse and grown in rows. Selected accessions were then tested in plots and as an intercrop in wheat, in order to test their suitability as living mulch. Moreover, a frost resistance screening was carried out in a climate chamber. Adaptation to southern German conditions and frost tolerance was generally better than expected, as most accessions survived winters with snow cover and transitory temperatures as low as C. Accessions with particularly high frost tolerance were identified and several accessions persisted over four generations of self-reseeding. Although there was a large range of morphological characteristics, no differences concerning their suitability as living mulch could be observed. The results suggest that subterranean clover is sufficiently winter hardy to be grown as an overwintering cover crop or living mulch in southern Germany. Commercially available cultivars appear suitable in the first instance, even though these have not been selected for cold winters. However, adaptation might be further improved by targeted selection among accessions.

The key role in the restoration of biodiversity and soil aggregate stability is fulfilled by organic fertilization. Potato reacts well to this type of fertilization. On the other hand, its tubers, during both the vegetative and storage periods, are exposed to a series of infections caused by soil fungi. Of particular economic importance is dry rot, a storage disease with a complex etiology. This study presents an evaluation of the impact of different organic fertilization forms (manure, white mustard intercrop, barley stubble, barley straw and a combination of barley straw and white mustard intercrop) on losses caused by dry rot. For the first time, their role in the formation of: counts, species composition and belonging to frequency and trophic groups of fungi communities colonizing dry-rotting tubers has been specified. Furthermore, a pioneering element of this research is its evaluation of fungi community biodiversity and its influence on the development of dry rot. The main discoveries are as follows: (i) 24 fungi species (14 pathogenic, 6 saprotrophic, 4 antagonistic), which are the cause of dry rot; (ii) dry rot development is mainly determined by the share of saprotrophic fungi, where their increase reduces the percentage of infected tubers; (iii) manure and white mustard favors tuber colonization by saprotrophic and antagonistic fungi and increases biodiversity of the fungi, which results in improved healthiness; (iv) straw and a lack of fertilization increase the frequency of pathogens and reduce biodiversity, resulting in a stronger development of dry rot. In sustainable agriculture management systems, disease risk can be minimized through introduction of organic matter to soil."

Risk management in rainfed agriculture: An analysis of strategies and adaptations followed by farmers in Madhya Pradesh	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						"Adaptation; Climate change; Rainfed; Risk; Strategies; Varietal diversity"	"CLIMATE-CHANGE; INDIAN AGRICULTURE; ADOPTION; MITIGATION"	Madhya Pradesh is the major producer of soybean in India. Being predominantly rainfed, the state faces high risks in its cultivation. The study undertook a primary survey in Madhya Pradesh to analyze the risk perception of farmers, elucidate the strategies followed by farmers to adapt with the risk and to identify the factors influencing their adoption. The results infer that late onset of monsoon, erratic rainfall and pest and diseases were the major risks. The major risks were related to untimely rainfall, drought and biotic factors like diseases and pest. The major adaptation strategies adopted were intercropping (49%), crop insurance (45%), micro irrigation (17%) and varietal diversification (39%). The study discerns need to develop drought tolerant varieties for rainfed regions, low cost micro-irrigation systems, enhanced credit availability to the farmers and promotion of crop insurance to adapt with production risks.

However, conservation measures have been reported to increase soil resistance and decrease erosion. Hydraulic flume experiments were conducted to measure the detachment rate of disturbed soil samples from a peanut field with five tillage practices. Hydraulic variables were adopted to estimate the soil detachment rate and to quantify the rill erodibility parameter. The disturbed soil detachment rates are substantially greater than those for comparable undisturbed soil experiments. The average disturbed soil detachment rates for the 5 different tillage treatments, from lowest to highest, are as follows: straw mulch (PC) < manure (PM) < peanut and orange intercropping (PO) < peanut and radish crop rotation (PR) < conventional downslope furrows (PF). The conservation measures (PC, PM and PO) have a limited effect on increasing the disturbed soil resistance under low flow energy conditions. Thus, the average rill erodibility is lower, and the critical shear stress is higher for the PC, PM and PO treatments than those of the PR and PF treatments. With a slope gradient steeper than 17.6%, there is no significant difference among the detachment rates of all treatments. A linear function of both flow rate and slope gradient can be used to estimate the disturbed soil detachment rate. Both stream power and flow shear stress are more effective than the unit stream power in predicting soil detachment rates. The stream power is the most effective predictor among the three hydraulic parameters studied. Instead of the power functions, the linear functions of the hydraulic parameters are suggested to quantify the disturbed soil detachment rates.

However, studies are necessary to identify practices that can improve the crop performance, especially in no-tillage systems. This study aimed to assess the effect of cover crops in association with corn on the development and yield of rice cultivated in rotation and cover fertilized with nitrogen doses. The sprinkler irrigation system was used and the experiment was developed in the 2014/2015 and 2016/2017 harvest years, using a randomized block design, in a 5 x 4 factorial scheme. The treatments consisted of the crop remains combinations of single corn crop, corn + Crotalaria spectabilis, corn + pigeon pea, corn + jack bean and corn + Urochloa ruziziensis, as well as cover nitrogen doses (0 kg ha(-1), 40 kg ha(-1), 80 kg ha(-1) and 120 kg ha(-1)) in the rice. The cultivation of upland rice in rotation with corn + pigeon pea was favored by the greater soil cover and nitrogen supply via cycling, if compared to the rotation with single corn crop. The intercropped corn + pigeon pea cultivation in the previous summer resulted in a 15 % increase in the yield of rice grains seeded in the rotation, when compared to the single corn crop. The cover nitrogen application positively influenced the grain yield with the maximum estimated doses of 46 kg ha(-1 )and 105 kg ha(-1) of nitrogen, respectively in the 2014/2015 and 2016/2017 harvest years.

Trees were headed back from ground level in summer. Out of the numerous shoots emerged, 1-2 shoots were budded with early, mid and late season's cultivar. In subsequent years, inter-cropping was carried out in the ber (Ziziphus maurtitiajna Lam.) alleys with greengram (Vigna radiata L.), pearlmillet (Pennisetum glaucum L.) and senna (Cassia angustifolia) at two alleys spacing, i.e. 6 m and 12 m (plant to plant spacing in both the alleys was 6 m) tested over three ber varieties, viz. Gola, Seb and Umran in split-plot design replicated thrice. The rejuvenated trees attained profitable yield level within three years of rejuvenation. Gola ber recorded highest productivity (57.3 q/ha) followed by Seb and Umran. Amongst intercrops, the productivity of greengram as ber equivalent yield was 1.7 and 4.2 times higher over pearl millet and senna, respectively. Although, wider spacing increased the productivity of intercrops by 24%. But, the total system productivity in wider ber alleys was 50.47% less during first year followed by 30.3, 34.6 and 40% during subsequent years, respectively, compared to 6 m x 6 m spacing. The profitability was also higher under 6 m x 6 m spacing. The ber + greengram system gave highest net returns (84.79 x 10(3) (sic)/ha) over other. This agri-horti system also maintained the initial soil fertility status even after four crop cycles. Hence, the appropriate strategy should be to introduce intercrops preferably green gram at a recommended spacing (6 m x 6 m) of ber variety Gola for highest system productivity and profitability.

There are many ways to perform CT, in particular concerning the control of weeds, but few studies have taken into account these methods, which could explain the lack of consensus about the effect of CT compared to T. We tested differences in breeding birds abundance between CT and T while accounting for weed control methods in oilseed rape and wheat CT fields. During the intercrop period, one CT system used a cover crop to control weeds (CTcc), the other used herbicides (CTh) and the control (T) system only used a tillage. We made CTcc/T and CTh/T comparisons by sampling bird abundance (respectively 49 CTcc/51 T and 30 CTh/33 T point counts). We show substantial differences between CTcc/T and CTh/T comparisons as we detected greater bird abundances in CTcc than T for 5 species (2.3-4.1 times more individuals) and a lower abundance in CTh than T for 2 species (2.1-2.2 times less individuals). Our results demonstrate the importance to account for system features to ensure the CT efficiency for farmland birds, declining strongly in Europe since 1980 ( 55 to -67%). Results also highlight an even more negative impact of herbicides than tillage, showing that stopping tillage to intensify herbicide use is not a promising way.

Soil characteristics and the resistance of soil to erosion agents can be improved with appropriate management practices. In this study, hydraulic flume experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of five management practices [manure fertilizer (PM), straw mulch cover (PC), peanut-orange intercropping (PO), peanut-radish rotation (PR) and traditional farrow peanut (PF)] on soil detachment. Based on the results, three conservation management practices (PC, PM and PO) increased the resistance of soil to concentrated flow erosion. The rill erodibility of different treatments was ranked as follows: PC (0.001 s m(-1)) < PM (0.004 s m(-1)) < PO (0.007 s m(-1)) < PF (0.01 s m(-1)) < PR (0.027 s m(-1)). The rill erodibility was affected by soil organic content, aggregate stability and bulk density. The soil detachment rate was closely correlated with the flow discharge and slope gradient, and power functions for these two factors were developed to evaluate soil detachment rates. Additionally, the shear stress, stream power and unit stream power were compared when estimating the soil detachment rate. The power functions of stream power and shear stress were equivalent, and both are recommended to predict detachment rates. Local soil conservation can benefit from the results of this study with improved predictions of erosion on croplands in the red soil region of China. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The dominant form of runoff P was particulate P (PP). Runoff total P (TP) was higher at the vegetative growth stage and lower at the crop reproductive stage. TP and PP were derived mainly from soil Olsen-P, Al-P and Fe-P and amounts increased with sediment content in runoff water. Runoff P discharge was closely related to the changes in soil P forms. Soil Olsen-P, mainly consisting of some Ca-2-P and Al-P, was increased by elevating fertilizer rate. Along with crop growth, there were active interconversions among Olsen-P, Org-P, Fe-P and O-Al-P in the soil, and some available P converted into Ca-10-P, with O-Fe-P possibly being a transitional form for this conversion. The oilseed rape/corn system had less runoff TP at the early stage, and wheat/sweet potato system had a lower runoff P at the late stage. Intercropping corn with sweet potato in the field with oilseed rape as a previous crop may be helpful for alleviating runoff P load during the summer in this region.

Nowadays, alternative practices have been used for sustainable crop production. Green manure is an agricultural practice that aims to maintain or improve soil fertility, increasing its yielding capacity. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of green manure with legumes on the yield and quality of 'Vegas' roses. Grafted rose seedlings were cultivated in open field for 30 months. Legumes used as green manure and planted intercropped with rose bushes were forage peanut (Arachis pintoi) and jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis). Pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) was grown in a separate area, cut, macerated, and applied in the rows between rose bushes every 3 months. Plants of control group received no green manure, only mineral fertilizer and cattle manure, as in all other treatments. The experimental design was randomized block with four treatments (three green manure species plus the control) and seven replications. The highest yield and quality of flower stems in 'Vegas' occurred with addition of pigeon pea on the soil surface or chemically treated (control). Forage peanut and jack bean are not suitable for intercropping with 'Vegas' rose bushes due to possible nutrient and water competition.

Like humic acids in pig slurry were characterized through physics and chemical spectroscopy technics. Heavy metal levels were determined in ration that was offered to pigs, anaerobically digested pig slurry, and plant tissues from pig slurry-fertilized black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb.) and ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) intercrop. Soil contamination was evaluated by the pseudo-total heavy metal levels in six soil layers and the bioavailable levels in the top soil layer. Results indicate that the ration is the origin of heavy metals in the pig slurry. The approximate levels in the ration were as follows (mg kg(-1)): Cu 23.9, Zn 92.02, 153.15, Mn 30.98, Ni 0.23, Pb 10.75, Cr 0.34, Co 0.08, and Cd 0.05. The approximate levels of these metals in the pig slurry were as follows (mg kg(-1)): Cu 71.08, Zn 345.67, Fe 83.02, Mn 81.71, Ni 1.13, Pb 4.35, Co 0.28, and Cd 0.16. Like humic acids contained 55% aliphatic chains, 14% oxygenated aliphatic chains, and 15% carboxyls, demonstrating their high capacity for interaction with heavy metals by forming soluble complexes. Soil contamination was indicated by the accumulation of heavy metals in the six soil layers in relation to the applied pig slurry dose (ranged as follows (mg kg(-1)): Cu 110 to 150, Zn 50 to 120, Ni 20 to 40, and Pb 12 to 16) and as bioavailable forms (levels ranged as follows (mg kg(-1)): Cu < 1, Zn 1.0-1.5, Ni 0.1-1.5, and Pb 1.9-6.3). The positive correlation between heavy metal accumulation in the plants and soil bioavailable heavy metal levels and the lowest heavy metal levels under higher intensity of phytomass removal demonstrate the ability of phytomass management to reduce soil contamination.

Data gathered from various sources, such as a household baseline survey, farm trials, agricultural experts and government agencies, were used. Crop yields, crop prices, and prices for key production inputs, mainly fertiliser and rainwater harvesting through tied-ridges, were simulated for the net economic return distributions, e.g., pearl millet, groundnuts, and sunflower under different farm-technologies scenarios using a farm simulation model. The results indicate that an intercrop of pearl millet and groundnuts is the most economically viable farming system compared with other alternative scenarios if supplemented with rainwater harvesting technology. Risk neutral and risk-averse farmers both prefer this approach. If these technologies are geographically considered and synthesised, they may be cost-effective for farmers with implications for the current and future livelihood and productivity of crops in rural semi-arid areas.

Beauv. (E. ravennae) is a potential high biomass-energy crop with low input requirements. Iron (Fe) deficiency in calcareous soils is a widespread agronomic problem which reduces crop yields. Fe is sparingly soluble under aerobic conditions at high soil pH, such as in calcareous soils; therefore, plants cannot take up enough Fe. Increasing crop productivity of giant grasses, such as Ravenna grass in calcareous soil, has a positive effect by alleviating environmental problems. However, the growth character in calcareous soil and Fe homeostatic trait of Ravenna grass are largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed characteristics of Ravenna grass. The growth of E. ravennae plants were impaired in calcareous soil compared to those in the normal soil. In calcareous soil, the growth of E. ravennae plants differ among the water and fertilizer conditions; E. ravennae plants were grown better in the submerged condition adding micronutrient among conditions. These results suggested that impaired growth of E. ravennae in calcareous soil might be micronutrient shortage. We found that E. ravennae roots possess Fe reductase activities which were upregulated under Fe-deficient conditions. E. ravennae produced and secreted mugineic acid (MA) and deoxymugineic acid (DMA) to acquire Fe from the soil. The amount of MA was higher than that of DMA. Thus, E. ravennae might have both partial Strategy-I and Strategy-II Fe uptake systems. E. ravennae intercropped with transgenic rice plants producing and secreting MA through the introduction of the barley MA synthase gene showed improved growth compared to monocropped E. ravennae plants, suggesting that the increased amounts of MA enhanced their tolerance to Fe deficiency. Our results suggest that there is a considerable potential to improve the growth of E. ravennae plants in calcareous soils by enhancement of their Fe uptake systems through increase of MA production."

The plant species tested in the research were not frost resistant: buckwheat, millet, white mustard and berseem clover. A control were the plots without cover crops. The intercrops were sown in the first decade of August, in autumn a grown biomass was a living mulch, and after being damaged by frost in spring, the mulch was covering ground surface. Winter garlic bulbs were planted in grown biomass of cover plants, in the first decade of September. In the first decade of November and in the first decade of April, the selected soil parameters were determined in the soil layer of 0-10 cm: actual soil moisture (%), soil bulk density (Mg . m(-3)), total porosity (%) and water stability of soil aggregates (%). The harvest of garlic was conducted in the first decade of July. Cover crops mulches had an influence on soil physical properties. In spring, the soil from plots with cover crops mulching characterized with the highest moisture, higher total porosity and soil aggregates stability as well as lower soil bulk density. In comparison to the control cultivation of winter garlic, without cover crops, the effect of plants used for mulching on marketable yield was not observed. Garlic plants intercropped with the white mustard mulch formed leaves and bulbs of higher weight in comparison to cultivation without cover crops.

This study aims to evaluate the impact of different reclamation treatments on abandoned salinized farmland. We investigated four artificial reclamation treatments, continuous cotton (CC), continuous alfalfa (CA), tree-wheat intercropping (TW) and trees (TS), which were conducted in 2011-2012 in the Manasi River Basin of Xinjiang Province, China. Soil nutrient, microorganism and enzyme activity were examined in comparison with natural succession (CK) in an integrated analysis on soil fertility improvement and soil salinization control with these reclamations. Results indicate that the four artificial reclamation treatments are more effective approaches than natural restoration to reclaim abandoned farmland. TW and CA significantly increased soil nutrient content compared to CK. CC reduced soil salinity to the lowest level among all treatments. TW significantly enhanced soil enzyme activity. All four artificial reclamations increased soil microbial populations and soil microbial biomass carbon. TW and CA had the greatest overall optimal effects among the four treatments in terms of the ecological outcomes. If both economic benefits and ecological effects are considered, TW would be the best reclamation mode. The findings from this study will assist in selecting a feasible method for reclamation of abandoned farmland for sustainable agriculture in arid regions.

The most common post-harvest practice in rice fields in France is to burn and then plough the fields. Flooding harvested fields during winter may create agronomical and environmental advantages, but the economic profitability of the practice has not been adequately studied. We used a cost-benefit analysis to explore six possible agricultural scenarios during the rice intercrop period, at the scale of individual farms and of society as a whole. All scenarios were economically realistic for the farmer (benefits-to costs ratios > 1), except current burning-ploughing which was just below economic equilibrium (B/C = 0.93). The most beneficial however was harvesting rice in flooded fields, which saved irrigation pumping costs. Similar results existed at the society level, and burning-ploughing was again clearly unacceptable (B/C = 0.73), largely because of greenhouse gas emissions and the absence of ecosystem benefits made available by flooding fields. Harvesting rice in flooded conditions and maintaining water in the fields afterwards was the most profitable option, and remained so during our sensitivity analysis when a wide range of variable evaluations were simulated. More than burning and ploughing, flooding rice fields facilitates straw and weed seed decomposition and creates a range of environmental benefits including the provision of extensive foraging habitat to wintering waterfowl. Our results suggest that post-harvest flooding of rice fields in France is economically realistic for farmers and the most beneficial practice for society. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effect of sugarcane cropping systems on herbicide losses in surface runoff	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"Atrazine; Diuron; Metolachlor; Pendimethalin; Metribuzin; Paddock to reef"	"GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; EVENT FLOW CONDITIONS; LOWER BURDEKIN REGION; OFF-SITE MOVEMENT; MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; PESTICIDE-RESIDUES; WATER-QUALITY; ATRAZINE; DIURON; DEETHYLATRAZINE"	"Herbicide runoff from cropping fields has been identified as a threat to the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem. A field investigation was carried out to monitor the changes in runoff water quality resulting from four different sugarcane cropping systems that included different herbicides and contrasting tillage and trash management practices. These include (i) Conventional - Tillage (beds and inter-rows) with residual herbicides used; (ii) Improved only the beds were tilled (zonal) with reduced residual herbicides used; (iii) Aspirational - minimum tillage (one pass of a single tine ripper before planting) with trash mulch, no residual herbicides and a legume intercrop after cane establishment; and (iv) New Farming System (NFS) - minimum tillage as in Aspirational practice with a grain legume rotation and a combination of residual and knockdown herbicides. Results suggest soil and trash management had a larger effect on the herbicide losses in runoff than the physicochemical properties of herbicides. Improved practices with 30% lower atrazine application rates than used in conventional systems produced reduced runoff volumes by 40% and atrazine loss by 62%. There were a 2-fold variation in atrazine and >10-fold variation in metribuzin loads in runoff water between reduced tillage systems differing in soil disturbance and surface residue cover from the previous rotation crops, despite the same herbicide application rates. The elevated risk of offsite losses from herbicides was illustrated by the high concentrations of diuron (14 mu g L-1) recorded in runoff that occurred >2.5 months after herbicide application in a 1st ratoon crop. A cropping system employing less persistent non-selective herbicides and an inter-row soybean mulch resulted in no residual herbicide contamination in runoff water, but recorded 12.3% lower yield compared to Conventional practice. These findings reveal a trade-off between achieving good water quality with minimal herbicide contamination and maintaining farm profitability with good weed control. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	"Nawaz, A; Farooq, M"				"Nawaz, Ahmad; Farooq, Muhammad"			Weed management in resource conservation production systems in Pakistan	CROP PROTECTION			English	Review						"Allelopathy; Herbicide resistance; Resource conservation technologies; Weeds"	"SEEDED RICE; TILLAGE; HERBICIDE; GROWTH; YIELD; STRAW; STRATEGIES; MIXTURES; QUALITY; TIME"	"Resource conservation technologies (RCTs) offers pragmatic options to cut down fuel, labor and water resources. In Pakistan, the use of RCTs started in the form of a New Zealand imported zero tillage wheat (ZTW) drill in 1983, and now the ZTW plantation has reached to an area of 507,050 ha. However, initially, the widespread adoption of the ZTW plantation was hampered because of insufficient training and dissemination of information on the proper use of the machinery and planting techniques in Pakistan. In the past few years, rapid uptake of RCTs has been noted in rice-wheat cropping system (RWCS) in Punjab region of Pakistan, the main hub of RCTs, due to direct involvement of farmers during experimentation, and strong collaboration with local machinery manufacturers. In 1992, the inverted 'T' openers' technology, was introduced in locally manufactured ZT drills, which helped to make zero tillage (ZT), a user-friendly technology, acceptable at farm level. Now ZT drills equipped with inverted 'T' coulter technology are available at cheap and affordable rates. Still many farmers do not have access to RCTs machinery, which requires serious attention of policy makers. After the preliminary experiments on direct seeded aerobic rice (DSAR) in RWCS by rice-wheat consortium and Cereal System Initiative for South Asia, the technology has been widely spread on large area in RWCS in Pakistan in recent years. The other RCTs such as laser land levelling and bed planting of crops are also taking roots in various cropping zones of Pakistan, especially in RWCS. Although, RCTs resolves time and edaphic conflicts, reduces the production cost and save plenty of water; nonetheless weed problem has emerged as serious issues in the adoption of RCTs (especially ZTW, DSAR) in Pakistan. In ZT systems, no preparatory tillage is carried out, which favors the growth of many weeds (e.g., perennial weeds). Likewise, absence of flooding conditions in DSAR favors the growth of many weeds. Change in weed flora from annual to perennial weeds has been observed in ZT systems. However, pre-emergence application of pendimethalin, thiobencarb, butachlor, oxyfluorfen oxadiazon, and nitrofen followed by post-emergence herbicides such as ethoxysulfuron, bispyribac sodium, acetochlor and butachlor provides fair weed control in DSAR in Pakistan. Nonetheless repeated use of herbicides with similar mode of action for managing weeds in ZTW and DSAR in Pakistan may induce herbicide resistance in weeds as has been reported in various parts of the world. In this scenario, the integrated weed management strategies may be useful to control weeds in ZTW and DSAR. The strategies for weed management in DSAR may include the use of stale seedbed technique, use of mulches of allelopathic crops like sorghum, crop rotations with allelopathic crops, intercropping with allelopathic crops, use of allelopathic water extracts, and breeding of competitive crop cultivars. Moreover, strong socio-economic mobilization at farmer fields, extensive research, development, extension and training strategies are required for long term sustainability and tackling the problems of weeds in Pakistan for the rapid uptake of RCTs.

Analyzing lock-in in the French agrifood system	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						"Legumes; Pulses; Technological lock-in; Nitrogen management; Agroecology; Agrifood sector; Economic-ecologic conflict"	"LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; PEA-WHEAT INTERCROPS; PATH DEPENDENCE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; LOW-INPUT; HEALTH; FOOD; AGRICULTURE; PESTICIDES; CHALLENGE"	Grain-legume plants fix atmospheric nitrogen in the soil and thus do not need nitrogen fertilizers. Therefore, grain legumes can potentially decrease global warming, as nitrogen fertilization is responsible for half of all agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, grain-legumes have many functional and nutritional properties both as feed and food. Despite the fact that the European Union has granted considerable subsidies to promote grain-legume cultivation, their production continues to fall and there has been no satisfactory explanation as to why. This study provides an answer by showing that a situation of technological lock-in has resulted from the co-evolution of crop systems, based on an agrochemical paradigm, public policies, and market dynamics that promote cereals. This process began with the historical choice by European and French public institutions to relegate grain-legumes to feed in direct competition with imported soybeans. Moreover, interrelated factors, such as breeding selection, public subsidies, and food systems, have favored increasing returns to adoption for cereals to the detriment of grain-legumes. Finally, the evolutionary economics approach used here identified several actions that must be implemented together, such as agricultural cost-accounting methods, nitrogen management, institutional innovations, and market outlets to promote grain-legumes and move towards more sustainable agriculture.

With many insecticides for wireworm control now disappearing worldwide, there is an urgent need for lower risk, efficacious, and cost-effective alternative strategies for use in the twenty first century. To address this need, a novel intercrop attract-and-kill (A&K) method for controlling wireworm damage to tubers and reducing wireworms was evaluated in British Columbia (Agriotes obscurus), and Ontario (Melanotus spp.). Wheat seed treated with fipronil and/or thiamethoxam was planted in-furrow alongside untreated mother tubers. In BC trials, wheat seed treated with fipronil, or fipronil plus thiamethoxam, provided comparable blemish reductions to in-furrow granular applications of Thimet 15G, containing phorate. With these A&K treatments, mean reduction in wireworms relative to untreated controls ranged from 89 to 100 %, as compared to a 59.2 % reduction with Thimet. In the Ontario studies, mean blemish reductions of 81.2 % occurred with intercropped fipronil-treated wheat, and a 66.6 % reduction in damage with fipronil plus thiamethoxam in comparison to Thimet (83.4 % reduction). Reduction in potato yield due to competition with intercropped wheat was seldom observed. It is concluded that an A&K strategy with wheat treated with fipronil at 5 g active ingredient (AI)/100 kg seed would require only 3.4 g AI/ha, relative to 3250 g AI of phorate/ha to achieve comparable control. This A&K strategy offers a highly effective means of wireworm blemish and population control; has low environmental risk; and would be comparable to the cost of currently used prophylactic insecticide treatments such as phorate."

Response of fodder cropping sequences to irrigation scheduling in arid environment	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						"Dry matter yield; Fodder cropping sequences; Green fodder yield; Irrigation levels; Protein yield"	"WATER PRODUCTIVITY; DEFICIT IRRIGATION; NITROGEN UPTAKE; YIELD"	A field experiment was conducted at Jodhpur during kharif, rabi and summer seasons for three consecutive years (2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11) to assess the fodder production potential, water use, water use efficiency and fodder quality of different cropping systems under variable moisture regimes. The main plot treatments consist of four cropping sequences, i.e. bajra-lucerne, cowpea-oat-bajra, Cenchrus ciliaris - C. ciliaris + lucerne, bajra + cowpea (1:1) oat sorghum and three irrigation levels, i.e. 50, 75 and 100 mm CPE in subplots with three replications. Among the crop sequences round the year, maximum mean green fodder yield was recorded from cowpea-oat-bajra sequence, which was at par with bajra + cowpea oat sorghum sequence but significantly higher than C. ciliaris + lucerne and bajra lucerne sequences. Similarly, dry matter yield was also maximum from cowpea oat bajra sequence which was also at par with C. ciliaris C. ciliaris+lucerne and bajra + cowpea oat sorghum sequences but was only significantly higher than bajra lucerne sequence. During rabi season all crops produced significantly higher green fodder yield at 50 mm CPE level than 75 and 100 mm CPE levels but dry matter yield was at par at 50 and 75 mm CPE levels. Green and dry matter yields of summer crops were significantly higher at 50 mm CPE level than that of 75 and 100 mm CPE. This showed that irrigation at 75 CPE level optimized dry fodder yield during rabi season and 50 mm CPE during summer season. The fodder yield of C. ciliaris + lucerne system at 50 mm CPE and 75 mm CPE was at par but significantly higher than that of 100 mm CPE while fodder yield of bajra + cowpea (1:1)-oat sorghum and cowpea-oat-bajra at 50 mm CPE was significantly higher than that of 75 mm CPE. Water use efficiency (WUE) and water productivity were higher with bajra, C. ciliaris and oat grown with sprinkler irrigation. Among cropping sequences C. ciliaris -C. ciliaris+ lucerne system had maximum WUE and water productivity but statistically at par with cowpea-oat-bajra sequence. Water use was higher at 50 mm CPE irrigation level but water use efficiency and water productivity were higher with 75 and 100 mm CPE level. Protein yield was maximum with bajra - lucerne system followed by cowpea-oat-bajra while C. ciliaris-C. ciliaris + lucerne system had lowest protein yield being at par with bajra + cowpea-oat-sorghum sequence. Protein yield was higher with 50 mm CPE level as compared to 75 and 100 mm CPE in all cropping sequences. Irrigation at 75 mm CPE was best for C. ciliaris + lucerne intercropping system and 50 mm CPE for bajra + cowpea, oat - bajra, cowpea-oat-sorghum and bajra-lucerne crop sequence for getting higher productivity of quality fodder under arid conditions.

J	"Wang, Y; Fan, JB; Cao, LX; Liang, Y"				"Wang, Yi; Fan, Jianbo; Cao, Longxi; Liang, Yin"			Infiltration and Runoff Generation Under Various Cropping Patterns in the Red Soil Region of China	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						"tillage practice; soil properties; infiltration capacity; runoff generation; red soil region"	"SEMIARID MEDITERRANEAN AGROECOSYSTEM; DIFFERENT TILLAGE SYSTEMS; AGGREGATE STABILITY; CONSERVATION TILLAGE; SOUTHERN CHINA; ORGANIC-CARBON; WATER INFILTRATION; SUBTROPICAL CHINA; NORTHEAST CHINA; TOTAL NITROGEN"	Soil and surface water runoff are the major causes of cropland degradation in the hilly red soil region of China. Appropriate tillage practices are urgently needed to reduce erosion and protect the soil surface. In this study, five tillage systems [manure fertiliser (PM), straw mulch cover (PC), peanut-orange intercropping (PO), peanut-radish rotation (PR) and traditional farrow peanut (PF)] were compared in terms of soil infiltration and the capacity to generate runoff. Based on field-plot monitoring and simulated experiments, this study revealed that the organic content of the soil in the PO (19.43gkg(-1)), PC (1863gkg(-1)) and PM (1818gkg(-1)) treatments increased compared with those of the PF (1564gkg(-1)) and PR (17.17gkg(-1)) treatments. Moreover, the three tillage practices also enhanced the soil's aggregate stability and infiltration capacity. The average annual runoff generation rates of the treatments were as follows: PR (3,141m(3)ha(-1)a(-1))>PF (2,189m(3)ha(-1)a(-1))>PC (755m(3)ha(-1)a(-1))>PM (514m(3)ha(-1)a(-1))>PO (388m(3)ha(-1)a(-1)). The PO treatment reduced the runoff generation rate by approximately 823% compared with that of the PF treatment. Among the treatments, the PO treatment had the highest threshold rainfall depth (22mm) for runoff generation. Regression analysis revealed that the threshold rainfall depths linearly increased with the infiltration rates. The results of this study could benefit local soil management and cropland conservation. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The study also sought to monitor the agronomic performance, nutrient availability and microbial communities' in the rhizosphere. The potential of five crop sequencing systems comprised 'Pomegranate-Urd-Garlic' (P-U-G), 'Pomegranate-Urd-Pea' (P-U-P), 'Pomegranate-Turmeric' (P-T), 'Pomegranate-Broccoli' (P-B) and 'Pomegranate monoculture' (Pmono) under rainfed ecosystem has been demonstrated. After intercrop sequencing cycles, the essential relevant elements significantly improved growth attributes, physical, chemical and biological attributes of the rhizosphere soil compared to monoculture cropping practice. Maximum moisture content at field capacity (McFc, 24.9%), water holding capacity (WHC, 33.3%) and soil organic carbon (OC, 7.16 g kg(-1)) was recorded in P-U-P intercrop sequencing. This superior sequencing also recorded the available macronutrient contents (N, P, K), exchangeable Ca and Mg of soil which were increased by 8.15%, 36.9%, 8.6%, 31.5% and 22%, respectively over Pmono. Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) extractable micronutrient cations (Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn) improved by 15.6%, 23.2%, 28.7% and 16.5%, respectively. Microbial biomass carbon (MBc), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), and the plate count (colony-forming units, CFUs) of Bacillusspecies, Pseudomonasspecies, total soil fungi, Azotobacter chroococcumand actinobacteria exhibited significant variability. MBc and MBN ranged from 1723 to 255.9 mg kg(-1) and 12.1 to 17.2 mg kg(-1), respectively. Microbial biomass of Pseudomonas species (116.5%), Bacillusspecies (80.5%), total soil fungi (204.4%), A. chroococcum(219.6%) and actinobacteria (205.6%) improved significantly over Pmono. Correlation analysis of different attributes representing the chemical and biological properties of soil also resulted in a significant association at P< 0.05 attribute pairs. Principal component analysis (PCA) of soil quality attributes was also worked out to evaluate the differences induced among intercrop sequencing systems. The results inferred that PC4 accounted for 100% of the total variance in all intercrop sequencing. Therefore, no correlation was observed between the soil properties, and the first, second and third PC (PC1, PC2, and PC3). It is expedient from the studies that the intercrop sequence systems have effects on soil fertility indicators and has the implications for agricultural productivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence and the structure of AMFs communities in cassava grown after different cover crops, and the effect of the cover crop on mineral nutrition and cassava yield under an organic farming system. The occurrence and structure of the AMFs community was evaluated through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGE). A randomized block experimental design was used with four replications. Six different cover crop management systems before cassava were evaluated: black oats, vetch, oilseed radish, intercropped oats + vetch, intercropped oats + vetch + oilseed radish, plus a control (fallow) treatment mowed every 15 days. Oats as a single crop or oats intercropped with vetch or with oilseed radish increased AMFs inoculum potential in soil with a low number of propagules, thus benefiting mycorrhizal colonization of cassava root. The treatments did not affect the structure of AMFs communities in the soil since the AMFs communities were similar in cassava roots in succession to different cover crops. AMFs colonization was high despite high P availability in the soil. The cassava crop yield was above the regional average, and P levels in the leaves were adequate, regardless of which cover crop treatments were used. One cover crop cycle prior to the cassava crop was not enough to observe a significant response in variables, P in plant tissue, crop yield, and occurrence and structure of AMFs communities in the soil. In the cassava roots in succession, the plant developmental stage affected the groupings of the structure of the AMF community.

Taken as a whole, this means more complex and integrated objectives for breeders. Several illustrations will be given of breeding such complex traits for different annual legume species. Genetic diversity for root development and for the ability to establish efficient symbioses with rhizobia and mycorrhiza can contribute to better resource management (N, P, water). Shoot architectures and phenologies can contribute to yield and biotic constraint protection (parasitic weeds, diseases or insects) reducing pesticide use. Variable maturity periods and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses are key features for the introduction of annual legumes to low input cropping systems and for enlarging cultivated area. Adaptation to intercropping requires adapted genotypes. Improved health and nutritional value for humans are key objectives for developing new markets. Modifying product composition often requires the development of specific cultivars and sometimes the need to break negative genetic correlations with yield. A holistic approach in legume breeding is important for defining objectives with farmers, processors and consumers. The cultivar structures are likely to be more complex, combining genotypes, plant species and associated symbionts. New tools to build and evaluate them are important if legumes are to deliver their exciting potential in terms of agricultural productivity and sustainability as well as for feed and food.

On the other hand, it can depreciate the quality of potato tubers and raise storage loss. With bio-fertilisers like UGmax, farmers can limit the need for mineral fertilisers by activating minerals which occur in soil. Microorganisms contained in UGmax, enriched with the start-nutrition medium, process (compost) residue of the last harvested crop, straw, manure break crops (organic fertilisers), etc. Together with soil minerals, they make humus, a natural environment for soil life as well as a 'store' of nutrients. The aim of the following, 3-year research was to determine changes in the content of vitamin C, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and crude protein (nitrogen x 6.25) in cv. Satina potato tubers stored for 6 months indoors at the temperature of 4 C, depending on previous application of soil fertiliser (with/ without UGmax), varied organic matter (without fertiliser, stubble intercrop: pea, straw and farmyard manure (FYM) as well as a half dose of mineral fertilisation as compared with the control. The highest vitamin C content was recorded in potato tubers from the treatments with FYM, full NPK and soil fertiliser. With half the dose of mineral fertilisation, UGmax most effectively increased the vitamin C content in potato tubers in the treatments with FYM and pea. The biggest decrease in the content of that nutrient after 6-month storage appeared in tubers from the plots with FYM, 50% NPK and without UGmax (38.5%). The content of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and total protein in tubers significantly depended on the dose of mineral fertilisation, where full NPK increased the content of the analysed nutrients. Moreover, the content of potassium was significantly higher in tubers from the plots with farmyard manure (FYM). The use of the soil fertiliser significantly increased nitrogen and total protein in tubers. After 6-month storage in chambers at + 4 degrees C, the nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium content decreased slightly, on average by 4.9%, 12.4%, 13.1%, respectively.

Soil and water loss from gentle slopes, however, are always subjectively considered less important and are even neglected in practice. In this study, 21 plots including seven crop-rotation types (CRTs) under three different slight gradients (10 degrees, 15 degrees, 20 degrees), were established in Dingxi, a typical semiarid hilly loess area in China. Eight consecutive years of erosion data under different gentle-slope cultivation conditions were compared and analyzed. The most interesting and key finding is that water erosion remained far higher on slopes with gradients of less than 20 degrees than the tolerable criterion, even when some CRT measures and field treatments (e.g., contour cultivation, stiletto, minimum tillage, and crop-shrub intercropping) were implemented. Newfield techniques targeting erosion control on gentle slopes should be developed. Secondly, compared with other crop species, potato cultivation under sloping conditions was confirmed to cause the highest soil and water loss and should be strictly forbidden at large scales. Being a major source of income for local farmers, potato plantation under terracing conditions, rather than on slopes, is strongly recommended as the first choice for achieving the double advantages of erosion control and farmer income. Thirdly, water erosion on gentle slopes was reduced significantly when different CRTs coupled with land-closure treatments (e.g., farmland abandonment, leaving artificial grassland under natural succession, and consecutive fallows) were conducted simultaneously. This result confirms that these measures are effective for conserving soil and water, and are feasible in practice. Finally, water erosion depended significantly on the timing and proportion of rainstorms in certain periods. The sensitivity of water erosion to natural rainfall, however, was also dependent on the specific surface status. In summary, a higher occurrence of rainstorms coupled with crops that have poor resistance to erosion (e.g., potato, flax, and wheat) and up-down cultivation will certainly accelerate runoff and erosion on slopes, whereas natural succession without human disturbance or appropriate CRTs with contour farming practices can markedly reduce water erosion rates.

Here, we assessed the correlation between productivity and diversity of phytophages and natural enemy assemblages associated with planting date and intercropping in four cotton agroecosystems. Twenty-one pairs of data were used to determine Pearson correlations between species richness, total number of individuals, diversity indices and productivity for each assemblage every five days from 5 June to 15 September 2012. At the same trophic level, the productivity exhibited a significant positive correlation with species richness of the phytophage or predator assemblage. A significant correlation was found between productivity and total number of individuals in most cotton fields. However, no significant correlations were observed between productivity and diversity indices (including indices of energy flow diversity and numerical diversity) in most cotton fields for either the phytophage or the predator assemblages. Species richness of phytophage assemblage and total individual numbers were significantly correlated with primary productivity. Also, species richness of natural enemy assemblage and total number of individuals correlated with phytophage assemblage productivity. A negative but not significant correlation occurred between the indices of numerical diversity and energy flow diversity and lower trophic-level productivity in the cotton-phytophage and phytophage-predator assemblages for most intercropped cotton agroecosystems. Our results clearly showed that there were no correlations between diversity indices and productivity within the same or lower trophic levels within the phytophage and predator assemblages in cotton agroecosystems, and inter-cropped cotton fields had a stronger ability to support the natural enemy assemblage and potentially to reduce phytophages.

Effect of tillage and cropping systems on runoff, soil loss and crop yields under semiarid rainfed agriculture in India	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH			English	Article						"Stubble mulch farming; Ridge farming; Water stable aggregates; Sediment concentration; Soil organic carbon"	"ORGANIC-MATTER; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; MEDITERRANEAN VERTISOL; NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; MANAGEMENT; EROSION; ROTATION; STORAGE"	Cropping practice (tillage) is an important management tool for tackling water induced erosion hazard, promoting in situ water conservation and improving and stabilising crop yields from rainfed production systems of semiarid and subtropical regions. Four practices including conventional tillage (CT), ridge farming tillage (RFT), no tillage (NT) and stubble mulch farming tillage (SMFT) were evaluated for 11 years (1990-1991 to 2001-2002) under semiarid rainfed conditions in western India on a very deep, sandy loam soil. Green gram(1) (Vigna radiata)-mustard (Brassica juncea) sequential cropping and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) + pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) intercropping systems were tested for the first four years (first phase of the experiment). Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata)-mustard sequential cropping and cowpea + castor (Ricinus communis) intercropping systems were used for the following seven years (second phase of the experiment). Runoff, soil losses, sediment concentrations, crop yields, soil organic carbon, bulk density and water stable aggregates were observed for all the treatment combinations. RFT and SMFT were both effective in reducing runoff and soil loss. RFT, NT and SMFT reduced runoff by 69.4, 16.2 and 59.6% respectively compared with CT. Average soil loss in NT was 37.2% less than CT. Average sediment concentration of runoff during June-July was greater than in August-October for all treatments and average sediment concentrations were greater under CT and RFT. The highest average yield of all crops except green gram was recorded under SMFT. Surface soil organic carbon (SOC), bulk density and water stable macro-aggregates were all significantly greater under NT at the end of the experiment, but reverting to uniform tillage negated this effect. Micro-aggregates built-up under SMFT were relatively more stable than those all under NT. The results of this study demonstrate that in the semi-arid sub-tropical agro-ecosystem of Gujarat (western India) adoption of SMFT can significantly improve and stabilise the crop yields and reverse land degradation process.

Antagonistic bacteria in the soil after cover crops cultivation	PLANT SOIL AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"Bacillus spp.; Pseudomonas spp.; soil fungi; antagonistic activity; mulching"	"VAR. SATIVUM BISCH.; COMMUNITIES; RHIZOSPHERE"	The purpose of the studies was to establish the quantitative composition of bacteria Bacillus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. and their antagonistic effect towards soil-borne fungi after the cultivation of oats, spring vetch and tansy phacelia as intercrop cover plants. The total population of bacteria in 1 g dry weight of the soil from the experimental combination where mulch of oats was used was larger than in the combination with spring vetch or tansy phacelia. Totally, approximately three times as much Bacillus spp. was obtained from soil samples as compared to Pseudomonas spp. Tests showed that the most isolates of antagonistic bacteria out of the enumerated genera occurred in the soil after oats cultivation, and the least in the soil after the cultivation of tansy phacelia. Antagonistic Bacillus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. inhibited the growth and development of Fusarium oxysporum, Haematonectria haernatococca and Thanatephorus cucumeris in the most effective way. The greatest total antagonistic effect of Bacillus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. towards Altenaria alternata, F culmorum, E oxysporum, H. haematococca, P. irregulare and T cucumeris was found out after managing the mulch of oats. The smallest total antagonistic effect of bacteria was observed after managing the mulch of tansy phacelia.

Regional differences in several parameters could be observed. Field size varies between 3 ha in the region South and more than 25 ha in the region North-East. Cereals, particularly winter wheat, are the main pre-crop of sugar beet in all regions. In the region West, potato (15%) and corn (10%) are other main pre-crops of sugar beet. Intercrops are cultivated on 10% of the sugar beet area in the regions North-East and East. This percentage is much lower than in the other regions. In the regions West, North-West and South, intercrops are cultivated on 50% of the area. This also effects the soil tillage management in sugar beet. In all regions, the percentage of autumn ploughing decreases and mulching systems increase. The temporal development of applied N-fertilizer rates is equal in all regions with rates being lowest in the regions North-East and East. There are only small regional differences in the harvesting technique in spite of the different structure. In all regions, sugar beet are mainly harvested with self-propelled six-row harvesters. Differences exist in the organization. In the regions North-East and East, harvest is mainly done by specialized contractors, in the other regions jointly in machinery co-operations by the farmers.

The fertility of Cerrado soils is low and, consequently, phosphorus levels as well. Phosphorus is required at every metabolic stage of the plant, as it plays a role in the processes of protein and energy synthesis and influences the photosynthetic process. This study evaluated the influence of cover crops and phosphorus rates on soil chemical and biological properties after two consecutive years of common bean. The study analyzed an Oxisol in Selviria (Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil), in a randomized block, split plot design, in a total of 24 treatments with three replications. The plot treatments consisted of cover crops (millet, pigeon pea, crotalaria, velvet bean, millet + pigeon pea, millet + crotalaria, and millet + velvet bean) and one plot was left fallow. The subplots were represented by phosphorus rates applied as monoammonium phosphate (0, 60 and 90 kg ha(-1) P2O5). In August 2011, the soil chemical properties were evaluated (pH, organic matter, phosphorus, potential acidity, cation exchange capacity, and base saturation) as well as biological variables (carbon of released CO2, microbial carbon, metabolic quotient and microbial quotient). After two years of cover crops in rotation with common bean, the cover crop biomass had not altered the soil chemical properties and barely influenced the microbial activity. The biomass production of millet and crotalaria (monoculture or intercropped) was highest. The biological variables were sensitive and responded to increasing phosphorus rates with increases in microbial carbon and reduction of the metabolic quotient.

In the best tended peasant plantations aged four or five years the dry seed yield obtained in sole cropping was less than 200 kg/ha. Under these conditions, it is very unlikely that the yield achieved in sole cropping exceeds 800 kg/ha in full production.The average yield per meter of live fences older than fifteen years was 0.9 kg/m. Considering the purchase price of jatropha seeds in 2012 in Senegal (65 F CFA/kg - 0.1 euro/kg), and given the bad productivity and the low precocity of the available planting material, the cultivation of jatropha (as a sole crop or in intercropping) is far less profitable than the main cropping system practiced in the region (groundnut/pearl millet/sorghum/cotton rotation with input application). Any improvement in the economic performance of the production of jatropha seeds requires the selection of varieties that are early, hardy and productive. The establishment of living hedges is for the moment the only installation method that can be recommended to farmers. In addition to providing supplementary income related to seed harvest, hedgerows provide different non-monetary benefits appreciated by farmers: land demarcation, soil protection against wind and water erosion, improved soil water balance and windbreak effect favourable to crop development, crop protection against wandering ruminants, and enclosure for the cattle.

The treatments were evaluated in factorial randomized block design. The results revealed that pit method with both the seed rates gave higher cane yield than the recommended conventional flat method and paired row trench method with wheat intercrop. In the context of profitability, paired row trench and conventional flat method with wheat intercrop were better options than pit method. When compared, band application of different rates of FYM, the 15 t/ha of FYM produced the statistically similar cane yield as the recommended rate of 20 t/ha. Therefore band application can help in reducing the FYM rate from 20 to 15 t/ha.

The experiment was installed under field conditions at Western Agriculture Embrapa, Dourados, Brazil. Five fall-winter treatments, planted over one or three subsequent years, were evaluated: corn planted 90 cm between rows; corn planted 45 cm between rows, intercropped corn + Brachiaria ruziziensis, B. ruziziensis alone, and Cowpea. At the end of September 2011, all areas were desiccated with glyphosate, with evaluation being carried out 30 days after the first desiccation. The phyto-sociological characterization of the weed communities was based on abundance, frequency, dominance, and importance index of each species in the community. Areas were also intra-characterized by the diversity coefficients of Simpson and Shannon-Weiner and inter-characterized by the similarity matrix of Jaccard, through cluster analysis by the UPGMA method. Soybean sowing should be followed by sowing a species which allows accumulation of high amounts of residual dry mass on the soil surface, and this dry mass should present high C/N ratio. At this study, the intercropped corn + B. ruziziensis, or even B. ruziziensis alone, planted following soybean, allowed lower infestation levels by weed species after three years of cultivation."

Use of legume green manures as nitrogen sources for corn production	RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Article						"alfalfa; corn production systems; legume green manure; nitrogen fertilizer replacement value; red clover"	"COVER CROPS; MINERALIZATION; DECOMPOSITION; ALFALFA; SOIL"	"Recent volatility in supplies and prices of natural gas and synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizer suggests a need to develop and refine alternative strategies for supplying N to corn. In this study, conducted in north-eastern Iowa, we examined the use of red clover and alfalfa green manures as means of supplying N to a succeeding corn crop. Red clover intercropped with oat produced significantly more biomass and contained more N than alfalfa intercropped with oat. Tilling green manures in the fall or delaying tillage until the following spring did not have a consistent effect on green manure N content. Without N fertilizer, corn grain yield following oat-red clover and oat-alfalfa was 25-63% greater than following oat grown alone, but at the highest fertilizer rate (202 kg N ha(-1)), there was no difference in corn yield between oat-legume and oat-alone treatments. These patterns support the premise that legume green manure effects on corn yield were N-related. Red clover green manure had an N fertilizer replacement value for corn of 87-184 kg N ha(-1); alfalfa supplied corn with the equivalent of 70-121 kg N ha(-1). At a fossil energy cost for N fertilizer of 57 MJ kg(-1) N, reducing synthetic N fertilizer applications to corn by 70-184 kg N ha(-1) would represent a fossil fuel savings of 3990-10,488 MJ ha(-1), equivalent to the energy content of 104-274m(3) of natural gas. These types of savings are likely to become increasingly important as fossil energy supplies become scarcer and fertilizer prices rise."

Herbivore response to habitat manipulation with floral resources: a study of the cabbage root fly	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						"conservation biological control; crop rotation; pest insect"	"ENHANCE BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; ERIOISCHIA-BRASSICAE; NATURAL ENEMIES; PEST-MANAGEMENT; DELIA-FLORALIS; DIPTERA-ANTHOMYIIDAE; FIELD CONDITIONS; GROUND BEETLES; PARASITOIDS; NECTAR"	Biological control of pest insects can be improved by providing natural enemies with additional food resources such as floral nectar within the production field. However, herbivores may also benefit from this practice. The aim of this 3-year field study was to investigate if dill and buckwheat, aimed as food resources for natural enemies, could increase the densities of the cabbage root fly, Delia radicum L. (Diptera: Anthomyiidae), a severe pest on crucifers. Differences in egg density, numbers of pupae and sex ratio were compared between cabbage plots with or without flowers. Habitat manipulation by intercropping flowering plants with cabbage did not increase the overall D.similar to radicum egg density in our 3-year study, and there were no significant differences in egg numbers between treatments in any year. No effect on the fecundity of D.similar to radicum was observed, most likely because of the high mobility and feeding behaviour of the female flies, combined with high abundance and diversity of other food sources around the fields during this period. Despite equal egg numbers, fewer pupae were found in plots with flowers than without in one of three studied years. This finding suggests that natural enemies attacking larvae and pupae of D.similar to radicum were either more abundant or efficient in cabbage plots with flowers.

Because of the long-term data set, many developments over the last years as well as short-term adaptations could be described. Cereals, particularly winter wheat, are the main pre-crop before sugar beet (50%), nowadays followed by corn. Intercrops have been cultivated on 40% of the sugar beet area since the beginning of the survey. In soil cultivation, the use of reduced systems has increased. On more than 65% of the sugar beet area the soil is covered by intercrops or pre-crop residues. Since 2006, an increase in nitrogen-fertilization could be observed. On 50% of the sugar beet area, organic fertilizer is applied also. In general, the whole production process from sowing to harvesting is characterized by an increase in technical specialization. The work is often done jointly in cooperation of farmers, or by specialized contractors. Sugar beet are harvested mainly with six-row harvesters and beets are transported increasingly often with semi-trailer trucks.

Thus the aim of this work was to quantify the losses of soil, water and the potential for entrainment of sediment resulting from water erosion under natural rainfall. In this experiment we used four species of cover crops in two systems: intercropping sunn hemp with millet and intercropping millet with pigeon pea, and the cropping to millet, pigeon pea, jack bean and sunn hemp. To quantify the losses of soil, water and the potential for entrainment of soil sediment were used plots of 4 x 12 m. It was observed that the highest rates of coverage were obtained by species jack bean (77.63%), pigeon pea (64.55%) and the consortium millet + pigeon pea (64.11%). The lowest soil loss was obtained by cultivation of pigeon pea (1.27 Mg ha(-1)), millet (1.47 Mg ha(-1)) and jack bean (1.77 Mg ha(-1)), and lowest water loss was obtained by cultivation of pigeon pea (37.90 mm), in the consortium millet + sunn hemp (40.04 mm) and jack bean (41.83 mm). It is not possible to infer a relationship between the rates phytotechnical and protection against soil erosion.

Arthropod communities related to different mixtures of oil (Glycine max L. Merr.) and essential oil (Artemisia annua L.) crops	INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS			English	"Article; Proceedings Paper"	Annual Meeting of the Association-for-the-Advancement-of-Industrial-Crops	NOV, 2009	Termas de Chillan, CHILE	Assoc Advancement Ind Crops		"Crop; Weed; Herbivores; Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)"	"INSECT COMMUNITIES; WEED MANAGEMENT; DIVERSITY; IMPACTS; ECOLOGY"	Plants can host many herbivores and their natural enemies during their growth cycles. For this reason, changes in the relative abundance of crop and weed plants in a monocropping system as well as different crop plants in an intercropping system may produce great bottom up impacts in the specific and functional structure of spontaneous communities of arthropods. The hypothesis of this study was that the combination of two contrasting species, soybean (Glycine max, Fabaceae, N-2 fixing plant) and annual wormwood (Artemisia annua, Asteraceae, VOCs plant), would be related to different spontaneous communities of arthropods depending on the proportion of each species, and this would favor crop biodiversity without compromising crop production. The objectives of the study were: (a) to analyze the differences of spontaneous communities of arthropods related to different soybean (S)-annual wormwood (W) mixtures, using standard crop management for S production in Argentina, (b) to determine S and W total biomass and W essential oil content and yield and, (c) to analyze the relationship between arthropod communities and crop productivity. Factorial field experiments with 3 replications were done during 2006 and 2007. S density was kept constant (40 plants m(-2)) and different W densities (plants m-2) were added. Treatments were pure S. S + 2W, S + 4W, S + 8W and pure W (8 plants m(-2)). Arthropods were sampled at soybean full flowering and were classified in functional groups as herbivores and non-herbivores. S and W total and relative biomass and W essential oil content and yield from leaves and inflorescences were estimated in reproductive stage. Arthropod morphospecies abundance and richness were determined for each treatment. Data were analyzed using uni (ANOVA) and multivariate (CCA) techniques. Arthropods belonging to 7 orders presented a total richness of 48 morphospecies in 2006 and 36 in 2007. while total abundance was 379 in 2006 and 318 in 2007. The proportion of non-herbivores was higher than the proportion of herbivores. Different arthropod communities were observed according to each treatment. No differences were found among treatments in S + W and S total biomass production, while W total biomass and essential oil yield were both different among treatments. Relative biomass production of S and W was the main explanatory variable related to the contrast of arthropod communities between pure annual wormwood (W) and the rest of the treatments. Annual wormwood could be used as an accompanying essential oil crop or left as a weed in the densities tested in this work, favoring biodiversity and, eventually, pest management without compromising soybean crop yield.

The experiment was established in an Ultisol soil (Typic Paleudults) originated from Caiua sandstone in northwestern of the state of Parana, Brazil, in an area previously cultivated with pasture (Brachiaria humidicola). Two soil tillage systems were evaluated: conventional tillage (CT) in the entire area and strip tillage (ST) with a 2-m width, each with different groundcover vegetation management systems. The citrus cultivar utilized was the 'Pera' orange (Citrus sinensis) grafted onto a 'Rangpur' lime rootstock. The soil samples were collected at a 0-15-cm depth after five years of experiment development. Samples were collected from under the tree canopy and from the inter-row space after the following treatments: (1) CT and annual cover crop with the leguminous Calopogonium mucunoides; (2) CT and perennial cover crop with the leguminous peanut Arachis pintoi; (3) CT and evergreen cover crop with Bahiagrass Paspalum notatum; (4) CT and cover crop with spontaneous B. humidicola grass vegetation; and (5) ST and maintenance of the remaining grass (pasture) of B. humidicola. The soil tillage systems and different groundcover vegetation influenced the C and N mineralization, both under the tree canopy and in the inter-row space. The cultivation of B. humidicola under strip tillage provided higher potential mineralization than the other treatments in the inter-row space. Strip tillage increased the C and N mineralization compared to conventional tillage. The grass cultivation increased the C and N mineralization when compared to the others treatments cultivated in the inter-row space."

Study on the impact of wastewater irrigation on the quality of oils obtained from olives harvested by hand and from the ground and extracted at different times after the harvesting	SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE			English	Article						"Wastewater reuse; Olive tree irrigation; Fallen olives; Olives storage; Oil quality"	"SENSORY PROPERTIES; VIRGIN; PHENOLS; PERFORMANCE; TREES"	"Nowadays, lots of efforts are made in Tunisia for the exploitation of wastewater in agriculture in order to face a very elevated mobilization of resources in water (90%). At Sfax, a Governorate placed in the South of Tunisia, the annual rainfall rarely exceeds 200 mm, so the climate is fairly arid. The significant water deficit can be reduced with the reuse of treated wastewater (TWW). The Sfax wastewater originated from the municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) localized at 5 km in the south of Sfax, Tunisia. This WWTP is an aerated lagoon process receiving industrial wastewaters. Its treatment capacity is 24.000 m(3)/clay. Part of TWW is sent to the olive crops of El Hajeb, as part of a proposed wastewater use in agriculture. Already the wastewater is used to irrigate olive trees and intercrops such as cotton, oats and sorghum silage (Charfi et al., 1999). The aim of the present work was to determine the impact of the irrigation utilizing wastewater on the quality of the oil. The oils analysed were extracted from olives hand-picked directly from the tree and from olives that have fallen under the trees. Moreover, a study on the olive storage has been made in order to evaluate in which way the collection of the fruit could influence the quality of the oil. The results obtained showed that: Olive trees benefit from this contribution of water; irrigation by wastewater has a significant effect in the fatty acid composition; oils relative to olive trees irrigated with wastewaters are more sensible to the oxidization especially after olive storage; oils coming from olive trees irrigated with wastewaters are richer in polyphenols; oils extracted from fallen olives are of poor quality essentially after olives storage and when olive trees are irrigated by wastewater.

The results showed that organic farming reduced the input cost without affecting the net margin in all three states. Total food production was found to be comparable for the two systems in two of three states. While yield of rice and wheat generally was lower under the organic systems, yield from intercropping food crops was generally higher. The number of agro-ecological methods and percentage of farms practicing different agro-ecological methods were higher under organic systems than conventional systems. These results suggest that organic farming has the potential to improve food security of small farmers by reducing indebtedness due to the lower cost of production without affecting total farm production and farm income.

The purpose of this study was to develop specific (for each treatment replication) hydrograms (instantaneous runoff discharge versus time) and sedimentograms (instantaneous sediment concentrations in the runoff and instantaneous soil loss rates versus time), associated with water erosion in a soil under different crop sequences (winter and summer grass and legume species in no-till, mono and intercropped), with different physical conditions on the surface (toddled, recently-chiseled, previously-chiseled, and recently-disked soil, in addition to the presence and absence of crust and of full, little, and no cover by crop residues). The study was conducted in the field, at an experimental station of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (EEA / UFRGS), in Eldorado do Sul (RS), Brazil, under simulated rain on an Ultisol with a sandy clay loam texture in the surface layer and 0.115 m m(-1) average slope steepness. In the beginning of the study the soil had a high degradation degree. The rains (six in total, one for each erosion test) were applied with a rotating-boom rainfall simulator, at the designed rainfall intensity of 64.0 mm h(-1) (in this study the observed rainfall intensities were used, ranging from 59.1 mm h(-1) to 74.6 mm h(-1)) and duration ranging from 1 to 3 hours (determined to reach the runoff equilibrium condition in all erosion tests). It was observed that the hydrograms and sedimentograms were generally coherent with the conditions under which they were developed. Therefore, in most erosion tests the hydrograms differed more from one another than in the crop sequence treatments, opposite to the sedimentograms. The untilled soil surfaces with low roughness and cover, in general, provided hydrograms and sedimentograms with shorter start-up period and greater magnitude, regardless of the presence or absence of crust and type of crop sequence. The recently-tilled soil surfaces and those with medium and great roughness, in general, provided hydrograms and sedimentograms with longer start-up period and smaller magnitude, practically regardless of cover and type of crop sequence. The runoff from soil surfaces with complete cover was diminished and erosion eliminated, regardless of tillage and type of crop sequence. For the crop sequence with teosinte, the hydrograms and sedimentograms showed longest start-up periods and smallest magnitudes, followed by the ones with corn+cowpea and pearl millet, which differed little from each other. The replications of the treatments provided values of instantaneous runoff discharges that seemed more similar to one another and were more regularly distributed in time than those for the corresponding instantaneous concentrations of sediment and instantaneous soil loss rates. The obtained data were valuable for a better understanding of the variation commonly observed in the results of water erosion research developed in the field.

One system consisted of coffee intercropped with banana trees (shaded system) and the other one of coffee intercropped with pigeon pea (unshaded system). The increase in plant diversity on both systems was achieved via introduction of green manures such a perennial pea nut, sunn hemp and Brazilian lucerne. The population of L. coffeella, predation and parasitism of L. coffeella: mines were biweekly evaluated during eight months. The increase in plant diversity on both systems did not affect the attack of L. coffeella on coffee leaves and the mine parasitism rate.

This research was developed with the objective of implementing and accompanying the restoration process of the structure of a degraded soil, by planting crop sequences under no-tillage (autumn-winter and spring-summer, grass and legume, in single and intercropped systems), and later verifying the relations with water and soil losses caused by rainfall erosion, under distinct surface physical conditions (untitled soil, with and without crust; freshly-tilled soil by chiseling and by chiseling followed by disking after one month, and crop residue covering 100, 18, and 0 %). The field study was developed under simulated rainfall, at the Agriculture Experimental Station of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (EEA/UFRGS), in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, from May 2004 to Decembe, 2007. The six erosion tests, in intervals of about a week, were performed from October to December, 2007. The soil used is an Ultisol, with a sandy clay loam texture in the surface layer and 0.115 in m(-1) average slope steepness, and an advanced degree of degradation. The rains were applied with a rotating-boom rainfall simulator, at a constant intensity of 64 mm h(-1), for 1-3 h. For this study, water and soil loss data were adjusted to a rainfall duration of 1.5 h. Properties of soil and plants were measured in the experimental plots and water erosion in the surface runoff The crop sequences and erosion tests influenced the results of the study significantly, with greater differences in the latter than in the former. The erosive process was more influenced by the external or soil surface than the internal or subsurface physical conditions. In general, all crop sequences were effective in restoring the soil structure in the experimental period. The sequence involving teosinte controlled the rainfall erosion process most effectively with regard to soil and water loss and the one involving corn+cowpea and pearl millet with regard to soil loss. The highest soil and water losses in the study were observed from the soil surface with no mobilization and little crop residue cover, regardless of the presence or type of crust, but especially when this latter was slightly cracked prior to rainfall application. The soil surface entirely covered by crop residue, be it untilled or freshly chiseled, controlled runoff effectively and impeded erosion completely. Soil and water losses from the freshly-disked soil surface chiseled a month earlier, although the soil was the most mobilized of all and bare, were practically zero, opposite to what was expected."

We studied the effect of the presence of coriander and Gallant soldier as companion plants in the tomato crop under organic and conventional management on abundance of the tomato. pests and predators. The experiment was carried out under field conditions, at Distrito Federal, Brazil, from July to October, 2004. The experimental design was of randomized blocks with three replicates in a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement [Three crop diversification levels: tomato in monoculture, tomato intercropped with coriander, and tomato intercropped with coriander and Gallant soldier; and two cropping systems: organic and conventional]. Each plot had 80 plants of the tomato and the pest-insects and predaceous arthropods were collected every week in five tomato plants/plot. Tuta absoluta (Meyr.) was the commonest pest species in both cropping systems. The tomato intercropped with coriander and Gallant soldier in organic cropping system had lower abundance and higher diversity of pests, and higher abundance and diversity of predaceous arthropods, mainly at 80 days after the tomato transplanting, coinciding with the population peak of T absoluta (eggs and adults). The more abundant predators were spiders, lady beetles and ants. The spiders were abundant and uniformly distributed in both systems. The lady beetles appeared lately in the organic system, at the flowering season of the coriander. The ants were more abundant in the conventional systems."

The legume based cropping patterns, compared to others, conserved relatively a higher percentage of soil moisture (9.06-13.41%) at all locations. A highest benefit cost ratio in high rainfall zone was recorded in fallow-wheat (2.90) and sunflower + mungbean intercropping based cropping patterns (2.79). Under medium and low rainfall regimes, fallow-wheat and groundnut based cropping patterns proved most efficient and remunerative. The economic analysis of the data revealed the highest gross and net benefits for sunflower + mungbean based cropping pattern in high rainfall zone (Rs. 54077.00 & 34738.00 ha(-1), respectively). However, these benefits were highest in groundnut based cropping patterns in medium and low rainfall zones. The marginal rates of returns were substantially higher for canola based cropping patterns at all the locations (220.91-341.60%). However, fallow-wheat cropping pattern showed promising marginal rate of returns under both high and low rainfall conditions. The performance was well evident from groundnut and canola based cropping patterns at all locations in terms of soil moisture, benefit cost ratio, net returns and marginal rates of returns.

From each taluk 10 villages and from each village five groundnut growers were selected randomly thus making a total sample of 200 farmeus. The study revealed that majority of the farmers (49%) had medium knowledge level about Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices. Majority of the farmers had full knowledge on weeding (92.50%), summer ploughing (80%) growing cowpea/pigeon pea as intercrop (70%). Under the chemical control practices 50 per cent of farmers had full knowledge on insecticide applied, frequency of pesticide and its concentration. With regard to mechanical control methods majority of the farmers had low knowledge on pheromone traps (88%), destruction of alternate host plants(80%) and setting up of light traps (80%). Incase of insecticide of plant origin of IPM practices farmers had low knowledge on frequency of spraying name seed kernel extract (92.50%), its concentrations (87.50%) and preparation (75%). Out of IB characteristics education, farm size, social participation, mass media participation, cosmopoliteness, extension participation and innovation proness had positive and significant relationship with knowledge of IPM practices. All the 13 characteristics taken together explained a variation in 69.27 per cent towards the knowledge level. The results indicate that the systematic efforts on the part of extension agency are required to enlight and orient the groundnut growers on IPM practices having less knowledge.	"[Chandranna, J.

Late blight, caused by Phytophthora infestans Mont. De Bary is one of the most important diseases in organic potatoes and besides varietal resistance its management in Germany relies mainly on the limited use of protective copper based fungicides. The currently allowed amounts of copper of 3 kg ha(-1) and year are more than necessary for plant nutrition and thus are in contrast to the aim of sustainability of organic farming. The results of the presented studies show that it is usually possible to achieve good disease control with only 1-1.5 kg ha(-1) even under high disease pressure with the help of the forecasting model BioPhyto-PRE which was developed for organic farming. To increase the efficiency of less effective fungicides such as plant extracts in organic farming, disease pressure has to be reduced as much as possible by management approaches. Four on-farm experiments showed that strip intercropping of potatoes does reduce disease pressure in 12-16m wide strips with neighbour spring wheat or carrots. A cost-benefit analysis using the prices of the year 2004 showed that growing potatoes without treatment in most cases was the most lucrative option with slightly increased benefits by strip cropping the potatoes. Multiple stepwise regressions show that in organic farming the yield loss relationships between late blight and potatoes can only be determined when N-uptake is integrated into the model. Overall, only very limited yield benefits are achieved by the application of copper fungicides, in most cases due to the limited nutrient supply in organic systems. It is concluded that an integrated forecasting model for late blight management in organic farming will have to include data on growth stage dependent plant nutrient uptake and variety specific properties to allow for efficient and minimised fungicide applications.

The pastures were established with Bermudagrass coastcross (Cynodon dactylon) intercropped or not with the perennial peanut (Arachis pintoi). The intercropped pasture was fertilized with 0, 100 and 200 kg ha(-1) nitrogen (N) per year and the single-cropped pasture was fertilized with 200 kg ha(-1) N per year, totaling four treatments. The experiment was established in 2002 in a Haplorthox (Rhodic Ferralsol) in Paranava, northwestern of Parana, Brazil, using a randomized complete block design, with two replications. Between 2002 and 2007 the stocking rate was based on forage offer level. In March and November 2007, undisturbed soil samples were collected from 0-75 and 75-150 mm depths for the evaluation of soil bulk density, soil porosity, and soil air and water storage capacity. Continuous grazing with stocking rates controlled as a function of the pasture production did not damage the soil physical quality.

The objective of this study was to evaluate soil management systems that decrease soil erosion and improve the fertility status of a Typic Paleudults originated from Caiua sandstone, cultivated with citrus in the northwestern state of Parana, Brazil. Two soil tillage systems were evaluated: conventional tillage (CT) in the entire area, and strip-tillage (ST) with 2 m width, with different interrow management systems. The citrus cultivar was Pera orange (Citrus sinensis) grafted onto 'Rangpur' lime (Citrus limonia) rootstock. The citrus orchard was established in August 1993, and the tree rows were spaced 7 m apart with 4 m between trees. The experiment was set up in a randomized block design with three replications and six treatments: (1) CT and pineapple intercropping in the first year followed by weed control with post emergence herbicide; (2) CT and annual cover crop with the leguminous crop Calopogonium mucronoides, (3) CT and perennial cover crop with the leguminous peanut Arachis pintoi; (4) CT and evergreen cover crop with Bahiagrass Paspalum notatum; (5) CT and cover crop with spontaneous Brachiaria humidicola grass vegetation and (6) ST and maintenance of the remaining grass (pasture) of Brachiaria humidicola. From 1993 to 2005, the soil and leaf chemical composition and fruit yields were evaluated.

J	"Wei, LH; Zhang, B; Wang, MZ"				"Wei, Linhong; Zhang, Bin; Wang, Mingzhu"			Effects of antecedent soil moisture on runoff and soil erosion in alley cropping systems	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Article						"antecedent soil moisture; runoff soil loss; alley cropping system; ultisol"	"CATCHMENT SCALE; SEDIMENT; LAND; INFILTRATION; PATTERNS; RATES; PLOT"	Alley cropping systems may prevent soil and water erosion. The objective of this paper was to assess the effects of antecedent soil moisture on runoff and soil loss in alley cropping systems. Five land use treatments with three replications were included in this study. The treatments were mono peanut cropping (P), younger trees (T-1), older trees (T-2), peanut (Arachis hypogaea) intercropped with younger trees (T1P), and peanut intercropped with older trees (T2P). The trees used were deciduous Choerospondias axillaris. Runoff and soil loss from the experimental plots were monitored and related to rainfall and antecedent soil water potential. Results showed that T-1 and T-2 produced the highest runoff and lowest soil loss while P produced the greatest soil loss. Soil loss was 25.3% less in T1P and 32.0% in T2P than in P. Runoff was 62.6% less in T1P than in T-1 and 56.1% less in T2P than in T-2. Regardless of land use, soil loss was more closely correlated to runoff than to rainfall (R > 0.95 versus R < 0.40). Runoff and soil loss varied with season and antecedent soil moisture. The largest amounts of runoff and soil loss were recorded in the soil water surplus phase (rainy season). In spite of less rainfall in the soil water deficit phase, soil loss was greater than that in the soil water recovery phase. The runoff coefficient was exponentially correlated to the inverse of antecedent soil water potential in the rainy season, while the runoff coefficient was negatively and linearly correlated to antecedent soil water potential in the dry season. These results suggest that saturation excess runoff may be dominant in the rainy season and infiltration excess runoff may become dominant in the dry season. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Screening studies on the host range of branched broomrape (Orobanche ramosa)	JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE & BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article							GERMINATION	Studies on the host range of Orobanche ramosa L., by screening different Summer and Winter crops, medicinal herbs, and a large number of weeds for possible attack by the parasite, revealed substantial variation among species in the number and vigour of parasites attached to their roots. The crops and medicinal herbs most affected were: Apium graveolens, Carthamis tinctorius, Carum carvi, and Trachyspermum ammi (with 36 - 214 Orobanche shoots per pot). Among the crops studied, Ammi visnaga, Brassica nigra, B. oleracea var. botrytis, Cucurbita moschata, Linum usitatissimum, Lupinus albus, and Raphanus sativus were least infected (with 1 - 2 Orobanche shoots per pot). Weeds, including Datura metel, Ferula communis, and Rumex acetosella were heavily infected (with 40 - 67 shoots per pot). In contrast, Antirrhinum orontium, Convolvulus arvensis, Diplotaxis erucoides, Polygonum aviculare and Solanum cornutum showed extremely low infection (with 1 - 2 shoots per pot). T ammi is reported, for the first time, as a potential trap species for O. ramosa. Other plants tested are useful as catch species and both may be used effectively to manage infestation by the parasite by their inclusion in crop rotation or intercropping systems. Non-host species, or those that allowed very low parasite attachment may be grown in fields heavily-infested by the parasite. Control of highly-infected weed species is necessary to prevent parasite multiplication and spread. However, timing this operation after parasite attachment, or before emergence may be effective in exhausting the soil seed-bank, providing the weeds do not pose a serious competition with the crop plants. Many of the plant species tested were not attacked, suggesting a different mechanism of resistance, or lack of stimulants for O. ramosa seed germination. Of the species reported to be good trap crops for this parasite, L. usitatissimum showed very low infection, but B. campestris, C. frutescens, C. annuum, Coriandrum sativum, and T foenum-graecum were heavily infected.

Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) is an annual legume that has been shown to effectively reduce O. crenata infection when intercropped with grain legumes. In this paper, we point that this can be attributed to allelopathy, through inhibition of the germination of O. crenata by fenugreek root exudates. The main inhibitory metabolite was isolated and. characterized. Allelopathy was demonstrated in different bioassays, by inhibition of O. crenata seeds germination both by growing fenugreek and pea plants together (intercropped), and by application of fenugreek root exudates. Fenugreek root exudates were extracted with organic solvent and fractionated giving several fractions, two of which showed moderate (27%) and strong (54%) inhibition of O. crenata seed germination, respectively. The most active metabolite is a new monosubstituted trioxazonane, characterized by spectroscopic methods as the 2-butyl-[1,4,7,2]trioxazonane and named trigoxazonane. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the productive performance of Brachiaria brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich.) Stapf cv. Marandu under different spacings on agrosylvopastoral systems with eucalypt. In December 1999 was planted (in Paracatu-MG Brasil) seedling seed orchard of natural hybrid of Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh x Eucalyptus urophylla S.T. Blake, intercropped with rice in the first year and soybean in the second one. After annual cropping cultivation, was planted the forage, in December 2001. The experimental design used was the randomized blocks, with four repetitions, in split plot, and seven spacings of eucalypt stand [(3x3)+10m, (3x4)+7m, (3x4)+10m, (3x4)+7+10m, (3x3)+15m, 10x3m and 10x4m]. Each split plots, the forage was planted in row and between rows of eucalypt. The photosynthetic photon flux density understory of the stand, the natural and dry matter production and forage quality of Brachiaria brizanhta pasture was evaluated. The results showed that the Brachiaria brizantha forage was higher between rows (shaded) than in rows, independent of the spacing, which not promoted changes in the grass content fiber. There were not significant different among spacings or rows and between rows to N and P nutrients content in forage, but the Ca, K and Mn content were highest under rows.

Strategies to improve and sustain food production capacity in the savanna: The role of leguminous fodder crops in maintaining soil fertility and health	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"crop residue; clipped fodder; dual-purpose legume; green manure; soil productivity; organic N"	"LEGUME COVER CROPS; WINTER COVER; NITROGEN; CORN"	"Soils of the African savanna are generally deficient in nutrients, a situation that has negative implications on crop and livestock intensification and hence on food security in Africa. The exclusive use of inorganic fertilizers to bring about increased crop production sometimes has negative impact on the soil. On the other hand, the adoption of fallow systems to rejuvenate the soils is becoming even impossible as a result of high population pressures, urbanization and industrialization. Alternative strategies for improving on and sustaining food production are therefore required. Organic manure availability is low since livestock population is low, and intensification without appropriate interventions could even worsen existing soil problems. The adoption of alley cropping is limited by the fact that its practice is restricted to the wetter regions. Modified forms of green manure, which involve the use of food/cash crops that farmers will accept and protect, if need be, are therefore suggested. Pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L.) is persistent and, if intercropped with other crops, serves as a cover crop that will protect the soil against adverse weather conditions during the dry season. This legume crop can take up nutrients from the depth of the soil profile and also serve as green manure at the beginning of the next growing season. Clipping of dual-purpose cowpea at 7-8 weeks after planting (WAP) gives over one ton of fodder, which is available for green manuring. Over-seeded legumes can also be thinned down and the fodder so derived incorporated into the soil. Incorporated cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. fodder has good liming properties, which can correct soil acidity, improve soil fertility, and thus reduce the need for chemical fertilizer; while also controlling obnoxious weeds. Cowpea fodder can be fed to livestock, to produce rich organic manure for use by the farmer. Also, clipped lablab (Lablab purpureus L), which has been observed to have good nutritive value as animal feed, could be used. In addition, other legumes such as soyabean (Glycine max L. Merril), which have been found to produce up to 20-89 kg N/ha in 42-63 days, can be grown as companion crops with cereals and can later be incorporated to supply N, among other nutrients. The farmer thus becomes a producer of his own N, instead of entirely relying on imported inorganic fertilizers."

Conserving and increasing biodiversity in the large-scale, intensive farming systems of the Western Cape, South Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE			English	Article							"RENOSTERVELD SHRUBLANDS; FIELD MARGINS; CONSERVATION; FRAGMENTATION; ENVIRONMENT; DIVERSITY"	"The Convention on Biological Diversity, adopted in 1992 in Nairobi and signed by many states, including South Africa, at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro later that year, urges nations to conserve biological diversity. This places a special responsibility on farmers, who own most of the land. Yet agricultural practices usually aim at simplifying ecosystems in favour of the crops (and animals) that are produced. In the Western Cape province of South Africa, this process has resulted in extensive monocultures of wheat, grapevines and fruit trees. The questions arise: should farmers bring more biodiversity back into these systems and, if so, how can they do it? Apart from the moral obligation to do so, perceived benefits include the possibility of greater economic and ecological stability, especially under conditions of global climate change; enhanced aesthetic appeal and greater acceptance of farming practices by the public in general and purchasers of farm produce in particular. Possible disadvantages are short-term losses in productivity and profitability. Measures that will contribute towards increasing biodiversity include: intercropping; the planting and maintenance of shelter belts, buffer strips and natural corridors; retaining riparian and other areas of high value natural vegetation; making dams attractive to wildlife; reducing the impact of pesticides; educating farmers and farm workers about the values of biodiversity conservation; and providing financial incentives to landowners for biodiversity conservation. An overview is provided in this paper of current international and national biodiversity conservation policies and programmes and some of the local initiatives that are active in the Western Cape to protect and re-establish biodiversity."

Twenty-six of 48 samples (54%) from various tissues of three recently infected plants were CMV-positive compared with 7/51 samples (14%) from three long-term infections ( plants affected by dieback for more than 1 year). The virus was also found to have a limited ability to move into newly formed stems. CMV was detected in only 2/23 samples taken from re-growth stems arising from known CMV infected/dieback affected plants. Mechanical inoculation experiments conducted in Fiji indicate that the known kava intercrop plants banana ( Musa spp.), pineapple (Ananas comosus), peanut ( Arachis hypogaea) and the common weed Mikania micrantha are potential hosts for a dieback-causing strain of CMV. It was not possible to transmit the virus mechanically to the common kava intercrop plants taro (Colocasia esculenta), Xanthosoma sp., sweet potato ( Ipomoea batatas), yam ( Dioscorea alata), papaya ( Carica papaya) or the weed Momordica charantia.

Its spatial and temporal variability results from topography, soils, vegetation and land uses. However, little knowledge exists about the effects of land use structure on soil moisture variability. In order to analyze soil moisture variations in relation to land use patterns, five land use structures and seven land use types were selected to monitor soil moisture. Soil moisture measurements were performed biweekly at 26 locations in a small catchment on the Loess Plateau of China from May to October 1998. The measurements were taken using a Theta-Probe at five depths of soil profile (0-5, 15-20, 25-30, 45-50 and 70-75 cm). These data were analyzed for soil moisture variations in space and time for seven land use types. Three peaks and three troughs of soil moisture variations during the growing season were found. The influence of shrubland on mean soil moisture within 0-70 cm was significantly different from that of cropland, orchard and intercropping land. Three types of soil moisture changes in profile were classified as increasing, decreasing and waving types.

The results show the importance of making full use of every open-air hardened surface to collect rainwater and to establish rainwater catchment areas by utilizing unoccupied land. The results also show that the usefulness of the harvested rainwater is enhanced when water saving and prevent seepage techniques are employed. The results indicate that in order to maximize investment it is essential to select crops with a water requirement process that coincides with local rainfall events. Potato was found to be the most suitable crop in the studied region. The economic indices for potato were superior to spring wheat, corn and wheat/corn intercropping. Therefore, potato production using rainwater harvesting and supplemental irrigation is the best alternative for cropping systems in the semiarid region of Gansu, China. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Each experiment included sanitation (removal of diseased plant tissues), fungicide (mancozeb) application, and an untreated control, as standard treatments. Late blight incidence and severity were greatly reduced by sanitation, without reducing the number of healthy leaves; however, tomato growth and production were adversely affected. Fungicide treated plants retained the highest numbers of flowers and attached fruits and gave the highest yields. Three cultural practices were evaluated in repeated experiments for their effectiveness in alleviating the adverse effects of sanitation. Tomatoes grown within plastic shelters early in the production cycle were taller, and had more healthy leaves than those grown late. The numbers of diseased leaves and disease severity were equally low in sanitation alone and plastic shelter/with sanitation treatments. Flower and fruit production were significantly higher when tomatoes were grown under early shelters with sanitation than with sanitation alone. Planting density was increased without significant effects on late blight and tomato growth and production. Intercropping tomato with soybean (Glycine max) or sesame (Sesamum indicum), with sanitation, limited late blight development, but taller intercrops suppressed tomato growth and production. Integrated treatments (combining plastic shelters, a sesame intercrop and high tomato planting density) were evaluated, with and without sanitation, against the fungicide mancozeb. The mean numbers of healthy leaves in the integrated treatments were not significantly less than with fungicide treatment. Late blight incidence and severity were higher in the integrated plots without than with sanitation. The numbers of flowers and attached fruits were not significantly less in integrated treatments than in fungicide treated plots, but tomato yield was highest with fungicide treatment."

The content of various nutrients (N, P, K) in runoff water and sediment fractions was the highest under sole groundnut crop. Groundnut as intercrop with bidi-tobacco and pigeonpea crops increased the content of various nutrients in runoff water arid in sediment fractions in comparison to that in respective sole crops. Among various cropping systems, sediment density under sole groundnut plot was significantly lower (2572 mg L-1) than in the rest of the cropping systems. A significant reduction in sediment density was observed when groundnut crop was taken as intercrop with bidi-tobacco and pigeonpea crops, than that under their respective sole crops.

A four year (1989-1990 and 1992-1993) field experiment was conducted at Coimbatore, India on Alfisols (Chromic Cambisol) to compare the effect of land configuration and nutrient management practices on yield of rainfed sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench). The land configuration treatments were flat bed (FB, the traditional practice), open ridging (OR, ridges, 45 cm apart and 30 cm high) and tied ridging (TR, same as OR plus ridges were tied randomly). The manure and fertilisers were farm yard manure FYM, livestock excreta plus litter at 5 Mg ha(-1) and coir dust (CD, by-product after the extraction of coir from the coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) husk at 12.5 Mg ha(-1)) in combination with nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertiliser levels. Tied ridges stored 14% more soil water and produced 14% and 11% more grain and straw yields of sorghum, respectively, than did flat bed. However, crop yield in TR was comparable with OR. Application of CD at 12.5 Mg ha(-1) combined with 40 kg N ha(-1) and 9 kg P ha(-1) was beneficial for more soil water storage and increased yield of sorghum by 7% over FYM at 5 Mg ha(-1) + 40 kg N ha(-1) and 9 kg P ha(-1). In Vertisols (Vertic Cambisols), experiments were conducted for two years (1991-1992 and 1992-1993) to evaluate land configuration practices. The treatments were broad bed furrow (BBF, 120 cm wide bed with 30 cm wide and 15 cm deep furrows on both sides), compartmental bunding (CB, bunds of 15 cm height formed in all the four sides to form a check basin of 6 m x 5 m size), ridging (RD, ridges were formed for each and every row of the crop manually at four weeks after sowing) and FB under sorghum + pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp) and pearl millet (Pennisetum glacum (L.) Stuntz) + cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp) intercropping separately. Compartmental bunding stored 22% more soil moisture and increased the yield of sorghum + pigeonpea intercropping than did FB in a low rainfall year. In a high rainfall year, BBF produced 34% and 33% more grain yield of sorghum and pearl millet base crops, respectively, over FB. However, BBF and CB were comparable. Pigeonpea intercrop under sorghum followed the same: trend as its base crop, whereas, yield of cowpea differed compared to the pearl millet base crop. Tied ridging and application of manures (CD or FYM) in combination with inorganic N and P fertiliser can increase the soil water storage and yield of crops compared to traditional flat bed cultivation in rainfed Alfisol and related soils of semi-arid tropics. Similarly BBF and CB land configuration practices could be adopted on Vertisols for better water conservation to increase the soil fertility and productivity of intercropping systems.

J	Muller, J				Muller, J			The economic importance of Heterodera schachtii in Europe	HELMINTHOLOGIA			English	Article						"beet cyst nematode; life cycle; integrated control; resistant green manure; resistant sugar beet"	"BEET CYST-NEMATODE; BETA-VULGARIS; SECTION PATELLARES; RESISTANCE; PATHOTYPES; PROCUMBENS; ADDITIONS"	In several European countries, the beet cyst nematode (Heterodera schachtii) has been a serious pest in sugar beet production for more than 150 years. No reliable data on yield losses are available, but it is estimated that the annual yield loss in the EU countries on the world market sugar price level amounts to 90 million Euro (ca. 95 million US $). In Germany, chemical agents are not registered for control. Therefore, different components for the integrated control of beet cyst nematode are assessed: Decisions based on economic thresholds are questionable, inasmuch as routine population assessments based on soil sample analyses are unreliable. Antagonists are widespread but have not proven useful for field control. Targeted application of nematicides to isolated patches of infection is not practicable. Selective pesticides and products preserving beneficial organisms are lacking. Intercropping of resistant radish in sugar beet has given negative results. A long rotation of one in five is effective but not economical. Resistant green manure crops can reduce nematode populations by 60 % and more and thus make a three-year rotation possible. 17 oil radish and 16 mustard varieties are now registered as resistant and are used as catch crops after winter barley or all over the season in set aside fields. In Germany, the first sugar beet variety with resistance to H. schachtii was registered in 1998. In field trials on infested soil, sugar yield of the resistant variety was comparable or even superior to sugar yield of susceptible varieties. Transmission of the resistance is not complete, ca. 5 % of all plants are susceptible. The monogenic resistance can be broken by virulent nematodes. Strategies are needed to prevent the selection of pathotypes in field conditions.

Sugar cane was planted as the main crop and sweet corn and wheat were planted as intercrops at 0, 75, 150, and 300 kg N ha(-1). After the harvest of the sweet corn and wheat, the senesced and harvested crop plants were left and evenly spread in the field between the sugar cane rows. The residues of the intercropped sweet corn and wheat plants were used to compare the amount of residue cover with the photograph slide method and the point intercept method. The average per cent residue cover was significantly higher in wheat than in sweet corn at 0 and 75 kg N ha(-1). Application of 150 kg N ha(-1) produced maximum residue cover. Results indicated that both methods produced similar estimation of crop residue cover at 75, 150, and 300 kg N ha(-1). The photographic method gave a significantly higher crop residue cover than the point intercept method in the 0 kg N ha-(1) treatment. Both the point intercept method and the photographic method gave similar estimation of crop residue cover. The results of the study showed that the point intercept method is easier and economical to estimate crop residue cover than the photographic slide method. However, the photographic slide method has the advantage of producing a permanent record that could be revisited.

The potential proved to be much greater in the rotation field (sugar beet-wheat) than in the monoculture held (mangold). The green manuring with three different intercrops reduced the potential in soil from the rotation field and promoted it in the monoculture field. Investigation on the diversity of egg pathogens in the two fields showed that the monoculture held had a greater diversity than the rotation field. A large fungal diversity is thought to act as a buffer against microbial changes. This is probably a reason why green manuring in the monoculture field did not reduce this fungal diversity as markedly as in the rotation field and why it did not reduce the potential of egg pathogenic fungi in the same held.

Because no differences in weed suppression between the species/cultivars were found in the first experiment, Trifolium repens L. cv. Pertina, which had least negative impact on cabbage yield was chosen for the second experiment. In addition, Trifolium subterraneum L. cv. Geraldton was included. The competition between cover crop and cabbage was considerable in the second experiment. Mowing once or twice did not improve cabbage yield compared with unmoewed treatments. A considerable increase in cabbage yield was achieved both in subclover and white clover by rototilling between the rows 6 weeks after transplanting. The cover crops did not reduce weed biomass or number of weeds early in the season compared with monoculture, but weed biomass in late summer became significantly lower in living mulch. Rototilling was more effective for weed suppression than mowing. Cover crop combined with rototilling reduced weed biomass by 89% compared with untreated monoculture. Subclover living mulch gave the earliest and most ground coverage and the lowest cabbage yield, but it also gave the least insect damage. Both subclover and white clover living mulches gave significantly more marketable cabbage heads than monoculture due to less insect damage. However, damage from caterpillars, primarily Mamestra brassicae L., was too great in all treatments to produce a commercially viable crop. White clover intercropping in cabbage gave significantly higher oat (Avena sativa L.) yield the subsequent year than monocropping. The implications of the current findings on future efforts to improve intercropping are discussed.

We conducted this study to evaluate effects of several annual and perennial crop species on N removal, residual soil N, aggregate stability, and subsequent corn (Zea mays L.) production. Thirteen cropping systems were grown with various rates of N fertilizer for 6 yr on a Typic Calciaquoll soil in central Iowa. Perennial plant species were then killed, corn was planted, and half of each plot was fertilized with 224 kg N ha(-1) and half was left unfertilized. Plant analyses showed that the perennial C-4 species, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman var. gerardii), consistently removed the least N. There was little difference for soil total N, NH4-N, or NO3-N concentrations to a depth of Im among reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.), switchgrass, sweet sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). Residual NO3-N concentrations were higher to a depth of lm for subplots fertilized with 280 kg N ha(-1) for 6 yr than for plots fertilized with less N. Aggregate stability did not differ following reed canarygrass, switchgrass, sweet sorghum, or alfalfa. Without N during the 7th yr, corn following sweet sorghum produced the lowest yield (7.5 t ha(-1)), whereas the highest yield following a nonlegume crop was for corn after big bluestem (11.8 t ha(-1)). Corn without N following soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] yielded 11.1 t ha(-1), while that following alfalfa yielded 13.6 t ha(-1).

Bandicota bengalensis, Rattus rattus, Tatera indica, Meriones hurrianae, Millardia meltada and Mus sp. are the principal rodents associated with crop damage. In rice 0.005% bromadiolone in bait stations at 15 m interval provided 88.3% control success. Based on live burrow count and baits placed directly in the burrows, the percent control was estimated at 98.8%. Increased yield was recorded in fields treated with bromadiolone as against those of warfarin, zinc phosphide and no treatment. Optimum time of control is six weeks after transplantation. In wheat, which is followed by rice in many areas, bromadiolone bait reduced more than 98% of the rodent population. In coconut plantations, with an average damage of 45.3 nuts/palm/year, amongst a single method of trapping only, warfarin baiting, zinc phosphide baiting and bromadiolone cakes, the latter provided 100% success at the rate of 2 cakes or 33 g/palm in treated plots as indicated by fallen nuts. Single climbing to the crown in case of bromadiolone is an extra advantage in the form of saving in labour in comparison to warfarin and zinc phosphide, also providing 100% success. Cacao intercropped with coconut were treated with bromadiolone wax cakes tied at the fonds at a rate of 2 cakes per tree. After 15 days of treatment, damage was completely reduced. The working index of Economic Threshold Level (ETL), schedule of control operations, monitoring techniques and other integrated measures are discussed.

J	Mekbib, F				Mekbib, F			Farmer participation in common bean genotype evaluation: The case of eastern Ethiopia	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article								Advanced genotypes of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) were tested on-station and on-farm to evaluate their performance and acceptability under farmers' circumstances. Farmers were given seed of the genotypes to plant a minimum area of 100 m(2) to be grown as a sole crop or intercropped with sorghum according to their preference. Yield, seed colour, taste, maturity time, disease reaction, growth habit and many other bean characteristics were assessed by farmers. The promising genotypes were higher yielding than the farmers' genotypes in most testing sites. Pairwise ranking of the genotypes showed that in export-oriented western Hararghe, white pea bean (navy bean) type Awash-1 and food bean G-2816 were preferred. In eastern Hararghe GLP x 92 and G-2816 were highly preferred but white pea beans were not preferred. Genotypes in advanced observation nurseries were also evaluated by the farmers and some of the genotypes have been promoted for further testing in yield trials. Selection criteria have been proposed by the farmers in each region. Future breeding and selection of genotypes will incorporate the proposed selection criteria and priorities of the two regions.

Berseem [Cymopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taubert] as an intercrop did not affect cane yields significantly for both the years whereas yield of plant cane was affected significantly on account of intercropping with lucerne and oat (A vena sativa L.), ratoon yield was not affected by various intercropping systems. Maximum cane yield was obtained under sole sugarcane followed by sugarcane intercropped with berseem lucerne and oat, for both plant and ratoon crops. In case of nitrogen levels, optimum level (150 kg N/ha) showed the superiority and gave significantly higher yields over sub-optimum level (100 ks N/ha). Green fodder and dry-matter yields under berseem were significantly higher over lucerne and oat. Optimum nitrogen level yielded significantly higher over sub-optimum level of nitrogen. Chemical properties of soil were also improved at the expiry of the experiment over initial status of soil.

Adult Orius tantillus was observed in cages where there were eggs and first-instar larvae of H. armigera on sorghum and pigeonpea. We found that O. tantillus had two diurnal peaks of activity, after sunrise and before sunset. O. tantillus was found preying on first-instar larvae and not on eggs. However, a later immunoassay of O. tantillus collected on sorghum during period of H. armigera oviposition activity showed that predation of eggs did occur under certain conditions. The activity of O. tantillus on sorghum was significantly higher on the flowers than elsewhere but this was not the case on pigeonpea. Therefore O. tantillus was a significantly more efficient predator on sorghum than on pigeonpea. The results indicate that O. tantillus could be an important predator of early stages of an H. armigera infestation, particularly in sorghum.

Effect of phosphorus and legume variety on the growth of pine seedlings	JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION			English	Article							"FIXED NITROGEN; GRASSES; SWARDS; N-15"	A field study was initiated to quantify growth attributes of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) when intercropped with warm-season annual legumes. In addition to main treatments, subplots of phosphorus (P) and a cool-season annual legume were also evaluated as factors contributing to growth of pine trees. After 3 years, pine seedlings grown with 'Iron and Clay' cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] had grown to a height of 315 cm and had a diameter of 63 mm which was a substantial increase when compared to plants receiving other treatments. Phosphorus application had no effect (P>.10) on pine growth parameters. The addition of 'Tibbee' crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) affected height (P<.10) of pine trees grown with 'Comanche' partridge pea (Cassia fasciculata Michx), and pine trees grown alone (control). Regression analyses indicated no correlation between rate of growth in height of pine trees and warm-season legumes over a three-year period. Growth rate in diameter during this period, however, was greatest for pine trees growing with cowpeas. Pine seedlings grown as a control or with alyceclover had similar diameter growth rate, but then grew slower than pines with cowpeas, and faster than pines grown with partridge peas.

The prototype system detailed in this paper, emphasizes a form of sustainable agriculture composed of a technical system for increased water use efficiency and a technical system for diverse crop products and by-products. Favorable results were obtained with the prototype system in the experimental and field site of 1000 hectares. The key features of the prototype system included selection for: drought resistance crops having low water requirement and high yield potential, intercropping systems with high yield and high benefit, a grain crop yield computer model, nutrient management with emphasis on fertilizer balance and water use efficiency, tillage management and polythene film mulching techniques, establishment of water storage tanks for harvesting runoff to provide life saving/critical irrigation, ammonia-treated wheat straw and silage (corn stem) as livestock forage, etc. Further research is required to techniques for water harvesting and critical irrigation and water budgeting under conditions with different crops, and for application of antitranspirants.

From mid-June to early August A. flavokansiensis feeds on young leaves and inflorescences of D. llinoensis. At high density, A. flavokansiensis potentially reduces seed yield and is thus an important consideration for long-term stands that are to be grown without insecticides. The potential to manage this insect via intercropping its host species with other, non-host perennial species by monitoring A. flavokansiensis density on D. illinoensis within experimental monocultures, two-species mixtures with Tripsacum dactyloides, and three-species mixtures with T. dactyloides and Leymus racemosus was examined. Insects were censused 2-3 times weekly from mid-June to early August at two sites from 1991 to 1995. In the first three years, beetle density was generally low (<1 per plant), and did not differ among treatments. In the fourth year, however, beetle density peaked at 15 and 25 insects per plant at the two sites, and was highest within monoculture for most dates. In 1995, density was again low, but tended to remain higher in monoculture at one site. The results suggest that beetle density on D. illinoensis can be reduced in polyculture and may hold promise for the management of this insect herbivore within perennial grain polycultures.

A single crop of wheat has been a traditional practice for the 8 Mba of vertisols in the Ethiopian highlands with both grain and residues finding use. With proper drainage, early sowing of crops becomes feasible, and this study compared the local wheat system with eight other land-use types (LUTs). Replacing local wheat with genetically superior wheat, cv. ET 13, significantly increased grain and fodder and also the metabolizable energy from a land unit. When ET 13 was followed by grasspea, and intercropped with clover and/or sown between sesbania alleys, the feed, protein and energy outputs from the same land unit were further enhanced many fold compared to the traditional landuse. By combining crops and forages with different maturity and harvest times, it was also possible to change feed availability patterns during the year. How these different options could be targeted to serve multiple crop/livestock objectives of the smallholder is discussed briefly.

Merr.] between rows of 'JA 4' pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] was most productive and remunerative (Rs 13 303/ha), followed by 2:4 and 3:6 intercropping system of pigeonpea + soybean and pigeonpea sole. soybean-equivalent yield (2 751 kg/ha) and pigeonpea-equivalent yield (1 926 kg/ha), aggressivity (0.105), relative crowding coefficient (10.0), land-equivalent ratio (1.71), monetary advantage index (3 300) and mean yield index of soybean (80.4) and pigeonpea (90.9) were also higher in 1:2 row arrangement Intercropping system however, proved better than double cropping, as the latter needs higher cost of management and lacks soil moisture at 0-15 cm depth (8.9%) on receipt of deficient rains beyond October, precluding the sowing of winter crops.

A. pulvinum was the most abundant natural enemy of A. gossypii and accounted for an average of 80 % of natural enemies in cotton fields. The abundance of A, pulvinum was low in flooded fields and increased with the number of years since the field has been rotated from flooded to dried conditions. A. pulvinum was also more abundant in monoculture cotton fields than in cotton-wheat intercropping fields. A. pulvinum was a major limiting factor of A. gossypii population growth early in the season when other natural enemies of A. gossypii were rare. Other natural enemies such as spiders and coccinellids increased in abundance later in the season and complemented A. pulvinum in providing successful control of early-season A, gossypii in unsprayed cotton fields. The role of A, pulvinum in integrated cotton pest control is also discussed.

Soil samples were taken in time interval every two weeks from March to December in layers from 0.2 to 1.0 m. The course of change in N(in) in the soil during 1992, when winter wheat was cultivated, is characterized by a reduction of N(in) due to the nitrogen uptake by plants and by the accumulation of N(in) after the harvest. In the period from the end of June to the end of October in a layer of 0 to 1 m more than 100 kg N.h-1 was accumulated. High rainfall in November and December caused the leaching of the largest part of nitrates below 0 to 1 m of soil layer (Figs 1, 2). This nitrogen, unable to change into organic forms, is the potential source of the pollution of underground water by nitrates. Therefore, it is recommended that farmers cultivate catching intercrops to reduce the content of the soluble forms of nitrogen in the soil profile. The content of N(in) in the soil was evaluated to consider the uptake of nitrogen by winter wheat and sugar beet, soil temperature and content of water in the soil (Figs 5, 6, 8, 9). The dominant factors affecting N(in) content are as follows: crop, soil temperature, soil humidity when winter wheat is cultivated; soil temperature, crop and soil humidity, when sugar beet is cultivated. A mathematical evaluations of results and the equations of the model for the above-mentioned factors have been calculated, which make possible a more general and objective evaluation of N(in) movement in the soil. In the movement and in the accumulation of N(in) in soil were found out no significant differences between low-input and organic agricultural systems."

Increasing pressure on the land has reduced the length of the fallow periods, which are necessary to restore soil fertility, resulting in declining yields. To investigate ways of reversing this decline, three systems combining phosphorus fertilizer application, improved varieties of millet and cowpea, and improved agronomic practices were compared with the traditional millet-cowpea intercrop system in a three year experiment. The most productive system involved the rotation of fertilized millet and cowpea. Pre-sowing tillage increased hay and fodder yields in all the improved systems. The application of fertilizer increased the amount of available phosphorus in the soil. Soil pH declined somewhat in all treatments, although the initially low soil organic matter did not change.

The development of species-specific integrated pest management (IPM) programs for such pests depends on event forecasting, predicted density changes, and manipulation of colonization rates. Research on potato leafhopper, Empoasca fabae (Harris), is presented to illustrate the development of such IPM programs. First, based on first detection of spring migrants, local temperature patterns, and established developmental requirements of the leafhopper, phenological prediction of expected population increase is shown to serve to alert IPM scouts when to begin field-based sampling. Second, observed densities of adults and predicted densities from a model simulating within-field dynamics demonstrates that both within-field factors as well as landscape-level factors influence densities. Finally, intercropping of oats and alfalfa is shown to reduce colonization of adults as a function of oat density, illustrating the potential of crop modification as a means to reduce pest colonization. Although landscape-level management programs have been employed for some highly mobile, polyphagus pests, current lack of knowledge of potato leafhopper regional dynamics prevents such program development at present. Yet, within-field management may significantly reduce colonization rates, thus leading to reduced crop susceptibility to pest-induced damage.

We focus on the system's characteristics and the impact of government policies on its development. When paulownia is intercropped with winter wheat, their different growth periods and root distributions result in more efficient use of water and other limited resources. In addition to timber production, paulownia trees on cropland enhance the microclimate and therefore improve wheat yield and quality. Intercropping also stabilizes farm income and reduces farm risk by diversifying agricultural activities and providing windbreaks and shelters that stabilize crop production over time. China's rural reform initiated in 1978 is a major source of the rapid development of the system in the past decade. Reports of the good performance of the crop-paulownia system, along with its high tolerance to natural conditions, are likely to make it attractive to other countries.

The aim was how to increase the bearing capacity and to decrease the risks of wind erosion, mineralization of organic matter and nitrate leaching in calcareous low bog peat. During 4 years in the depth of 90 cm in the deep plough plains we found up to 100 kg NO3--N/ha less than in low bog plains. After intercropping and normal N-fertilizing there was no enrichment of nitrate in the upper layers of the soil after deep ploughing. Therefore, in this deep ploughed soil nitrate leaching during winter was strongly reduced. The organic matter in the top soil of the deep plough covering (2,4 %) is especially accelerating the biochemical processes in this young soil as shown by the ammonium and nitrate contents.

Even in an above-average wet season, the practice of bunding (a temporary network of earth banks) raised the total dry matter yield of the local sorghum cultivar from 4412 to 6007 kg ha-1 and its grain yield from 898 to 1103 kg ha-1. Another traditional practice, intercropping sorghum with a low density of cowpea, increased the land equivalent ratio by 10-30% despite marginal reductions in the yields of the component crops. Incorporating sorghum stover into the soil at the end of one season raised the next season's seed yield of sorghum from 403 to 551 kg ha-1 and of mungbean from 247 to 343 kg ha-1. When compared with continuous sorghum cropping, a clean fallow break in one season - storing moisture for the next - did not increase the subsequent yield of local sorghum, but increased peanut nut-in-shell yields from 333 to 604 kg ha-1 at an unfertilised farm site and from 562 to 973 kg ha-1 when phosphorus was applied. New systems that increase the availability of moisture and of the principal limiting nutrient, phosphorus, would lead to substantial human benefits.

A field study was conducted in runoff plots to quantify the effect of potato hilling on soil loss, soil moisture distribution and soil temperature. Three hilling practices; hilling performed at before crop emergence (pre-hilling), one-pass hilling (at 15 days after potato emergence), the conventional two-pass hilling (at 15 and 30 days after potato emergence), and the control (non-hilling) constituted the treatments. Root length density, vegetal cover, soil surface roughness and soil water infiltration capacity were quantified at different stages of potato growth and related with the sediment yield. Soil temperature and soil moisture contents were monitored using Onset HOBO sensor probes throughout the potato growth cycle. Compared to the conventional two-pass hilling, pre-hilling increased the soil moisture content by 6% and lowered the soil temperature by up to 3.4 degrees C at crop emergence, thus optimized tuber germination and growth. This ensured earlier canopy closure and reduced the cumulative sediment yield by 12 t/ha. The increased surface roughness resulting from pre-hilled ridges puddled the surface water and increased the soil water infiltration rate by 7 to 9 mm/hr compared to the non-hilled plots. Planting potatoes in pre-hilled plots has a potential to optimize the soil temperature and soil moisture conditions and can reduce the high soil erosion rates in sloping arable lands."

The aim of our study was to investigate the ability of bispecific mixtures to simultaneously produce these two services of N management in relation to their interspecific interactions. Methods Three field experiments were conducted at contrasting sites from summer to autumn to evaluate 25 mixtures and 10 sole crops. We measured biomass, N acquisition, C:N ratio and soil mineral N. Ecosystem services were assessed using both experimental data and simulation model predictions. Results Overall, prediction of N mineralized from cover crop residues was significantly higher for mixtures than for non-legume sole crops. Predictions of nitrate leached after mixtures did not differ significantly from those after non-legume sole crops and remained significantly lower than those under bare soil, especially for mixtures with turnip rape which benefitted greatly from being in mixtures. Conclusions Some of the mixtures provided a choice of compromises between the two ecosystem services, which helps define solutions for adapting mixture choice according to the site's soil and climate characteristics and to fallow period management.

Indeed legumes provide plant proteins for animal feed and human food. Legumes fix atmospheric N-2 and, in turn, provide cheap and green N fertilisers. Additionally, legumes are used as diversification crops in rotations based on oilseed rape and cereals. Despite those benefits, legume crops in Europe represent less than 4 % of arable lands, and European legume seeds are underused for animal and human nutrition. Nonetheless, European authorities are now fostering the development of legume crops for sustainable agriculture. Here, we analyse forage and grain legume-producing systems since 1950 in order to identify the actual constraints of legume development. We show that legumes can contribute to the agroecological transition for sustainable agriculture, food and energy and for sustainable agri-food systems. Then, we point out that high added-value niche markets are required for supporting legume production. The major research needs identified are (1) analysing the constraints of the current systems and identifying ways of moving towards systems that include more legumes, (2) identifying new and diversified uses for legumes in a sustainable food chain, (3) assessing and improving the ecosystem services provided by legumes at cropping system and territory scales and (4) promoting agroecology through and for legume crop management.

The potential role of annual forage legumes in Canada: A review. Can. J. Plant Sci. 90: 403-420. The need to reduce agricultural input costs while increasing soil fertility has prompted researchers to look for alternative crop production systems that include N fixing crops. Annual legumes can be used in rotations as forages and green manure crops to increase the organic matter and N content of soils and provide soil cover to control erosion and weeds. Despite the benefits of annual legumes, high production costs and scarcity of seed has hindered their use.

Nevertheless there is no doubt that climate change is taking place. Usually, attempts are made to evaluate regional and global risks of climate change relevant to agricultural production, but hypotheses for synergistic effects between agriculture and nature conservation are scarce. Generally, an increasing temperature will increase crop production levels in the northern hemisphere, which will justify a higher fertiliser input and thus increased nutrient losses to the environment. Here, the expansion of legumes in the crop rotation may contribute efficiently to counteract the problem, and in doing so biodiversity of crop rotations will be promoted. Longer growing seasons, combined with higher temperatures offer the chance for diversification of crop rotations as the spectrum of suitable crops is broadened. Possibly the most important synergistic effect between agriculture and nature conservation is related to the protection against flooding. Based on current knowledge an increase of the infiltration rate of agricultural soils will reduce the flooded area. in this respect organic farming possibly provides the best environmental benefits.

In recent years, the health of soil ecosystems has been severely threatened by the large input of synthetic fertilizers and the continuous monocropping in greenhouse-based intensive production systems. As a result, the N utilization efficiency has significantly decreased, which has had adverse impacts on soil, water, and the atmosphere. Additionally, soil-borne plant diseases are more frequent in greenhouse-based intensive vegetable systems. Shifts in the microbial community structure and diversity largely account for these continuous cropping problems in vegetable agricultural soils. Scope In this review, soil microbial deterioration, including microbial activities, C source utilization patterns, nitrification, microbial community composition, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are summarized. Soil microbial deterioration is due to the excessive use of fertilizers, which have caused soil secondary salinization and acidification, pollutants brought on by intensive vegetable agriculture, and principally continuous cropping of same or similar vegetable species. Conclusions Therefore, measures must be taken to restore soil microbial communities, including rational fertilization, rotation or intercropping, cultivation of catch or cover crops, and reductive soil disinfestation. Rational fertilization, such as the reduction in chemical N fertilization levels, substitution of chemical fertilizer by organic manure, and the use of bio-fertilizer and bio-organic fertilizer, is of decisive importance. This review provides a better understanding of ecosystem health in vegetable agricultural soils and recommends effective measures to improve the health of these ecosystems.

Our objective was to explore suitable conditions, at farm and downstream levels, for organic hempseed oil production in Sicily, taking on an action-research perspective that involves local actors. Based on a preliminary characterisation of barriers to organic hemp development at different value chain levels, we carried out targeted complementary investigation: (i) assessment on agroenvironmental performances of integrating hemp in durum wheat-based rotations; (ii) chemical analysis of local hempseed oil; (iii) exploration of marketing opportunities and value chain development. Our results showed that the lack of technical and economic knowledge as well as the deficiencies of suitable cultivars and adequate machinery were the main barriers for the organic hemp value chain development in Sicily. The analysis of agroenvironmental performances also revealed both strengths and weaknesses of hemp introduction in durum-wheat based rotations. Despite the identified limitations, we demonstrated that the organic hemp value chains represent interesting perspectives for the Sicilian farming sector, particularly in case of substantial barriers removal or adaptation."

Companion planting enhances pest suppression despite reducing parasitoid emergence	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						"Diaeretiella rapae; Repeated measures ANCOVA; Shelter; Parsley; Companion plants; Numerical response; Intraguild predation"	"CONSERVATION BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; INTRAGUILD PREDATION; NATURAL ENEMIES; GENERALIST PREDATORS; POPULATION STABILITY; HABITAT MANAGEMENT; ORIUS-INSIDIOSUS; APHIS-GOSSYPII; SOYBEAN APHID; PEA APHID"	Engineering agricultural habitats to increase resources for natural enemies has been widely adopted for promoting conservation biological control of arthropod pests. In this context, companion planting (i.e., intercropping) has been a common habitat manipulation used for bolstering the abundance of natural enemies by means of providing them with alternative food and shelter. However, the mechanistic understanding of how companion plants interact with the target crop, as well as with the pest and natural enemy community to influence biological control, remains poorly understood. In this field study, we assessed how companion plants (i.e., non-flowering parsley) intercropped with collard greens could affect the natural infestation by aphids, natural enemy activity and parasitoid emergence. Aphid densities were significantly lower in companion plant treatments over the first four weeks of the experiment, which likely reflected increased predation by sheltered generalist predators. The results also suggest that companion planting can indirectly influence the time and strength of specialist natural enemies' numerical response. Moreover, companion planting was associated with lower parasitoid emergence, which was likely a response to increased intraguild predation. It appears that by mediating a lower aphid density, companion plants may breakdown the dilution effect and consequently promote higher predation of mummies by generalist predators. Lastly, reducing aphid density through companion planting in the brassica system is appealing since Brazilian growers have a limited number of insecticides registered for aphids, which have been a detrimental pest that often turns the collard leaves unmarketable due to stunted growth.

This concern is in general in the Eastern Himalayan regions (EHR) of India in particular. A field experiment was conducted with the objectives to generate additional biomass and sequester more C in coarse-textured sloping lands. This experiment is done for four consecutive years in the EHR, India. The rice (Oryza sativa L.)-rapeseed (Brassica campestris L. var. rapeseed) cropping system was practiced during the first two years (2012-13 to 2013-14) and rice-rapeseed-cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) system during the two following years (2014-15 to 2015-16) of the study under different tillage and mulch systems. The tillage system included: 1) CT-RI: conventional tillage (CT) with 100% residue incorporation (RI) and 2) NT-RR: no-till (NT) with 100% residue retention (RR). The mulches included 1) rice straw mulch (SM), 2) Gliricidia sp. mulch (GM), 3) brown manuring mulch (BM)-cowpea grown as intercrop with rice up to 40 days after sowing (DAS), killed with 2,4-D and 4) no mulch (NM). The cowpea, as a cover crop was introduced during 2014 and 2015 as pre-rainy season crop before the sowing of rice to generate additional biomass in the system. The four year total above ground biomass yield of rice and rapeseed didn't vary significantly between CT-RI (31.93 and 17.40 Mg ha(-1)) and NT-RR (31.86 and 17.46 Mg ha(-1)), respectively. However, the total above ground biomass yield of cowpea was more under NT-RR (10.75 Mg ha(-1)) when compared to that under CT-RI (9.79 Mg ha(-1)). The amount of total biomass (above + below ground) and C added into the soil was more under NT-RR than that under the CT-RI. After 4 cropping cycles, the NT-RR had higher SOC concentration, pool (29.9 vs. 29.1 Mg ha(-1)), sequestration rate (450 vs. 265 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and C retention efficiency (7.7 vs. 4.6%) than those under the CT-RI at 0-30 cm depth. The mulched plots produced more crop biomass (both above and below ground), recycled more C in soils with a trend of relatively more SOC pool (29.7-29.8 vs. 29.0 Mg ha(-1)), sequestration rate (391-428 vs. 221 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and C retention efficiency (6.64-6.94% vs. 4.66%) than those of NM treatment. These results were seen despite difference among the mulch treatments (SM, GM and BM) which were statistically non-significant after 4 cropping cycles. Inclusion of cowpea as cover crop during pre-rainy season in the system doubled the rate of C sequestration (478 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). Therefore, the data supports the recommendation of cultivation of the rice -rapeseed system under NT-RR along with cowpea intercropping up to 40 DAS (BM) in rice. Besides this, the inclusion of pre-rainy season cowpea before rice could generate additional biomass and enhance SOC sequestration on upland and sloping hills in the EHR of India and in similar conditions elsewhere.

Therefore, the safety and quality of raw tea leaves are important indices for making tea and related products. Habitat management has been widely used as an environmentally friendly method to control pests in agroecosystems. To investigate the impact of habitat management on tea plantation ecosystems, a habitat management approach with intercropping was established. The function of habitat management on pest control was evaluated. Furthermore, metabolome and transcriptome analysis were applied to assay changes in quality-related metabolites. The habitat management approach was found to maintain arthropod biodiversity and develop natural arthropod enemies in the tea plantation. Therefore, the yield of the habitat management-treated tea plantation was increased. Metabolome analysis showed that epigallocatechin-3-gallate, the major catechin in tea leaves, has a significantly increased content in leaves of tea plants under habitat management compared with those in the control tea plantation. The content of L-theanine, the major amino acid in tea leaves, was not significantly changed in tea plants under habitat management. Furthermore, aroma compounds were more abundant in tea leaves from the habitat management-treated tea plantation than those from the chemical pesticide-treated tea plantation. Therefore, habitat management is reported for the first time as a safe and effective approach to improving the yield and quality of tea leaves.

Here we quantified biomass allocation of intercropped cotton (Gossypittin hirsutum) growing at two population densities (3.0 and 7.5 plants m(-2)) and with or without application of the growth regulator mepiquat chloride (MC) in three consecutive years. The beta growth function was used to quantitatively characterize the dynamics of biomass partitioning. Compared to low density, high density increased daily growth rate and final above-ground dry matter, but decreased allocation to fruits. Application of MC did not affect dry matter accumulation but increased allocation to fruits by 22%. The parameters of the beta growth function have a clear biological interpretation, providing a useful quantitative characterization of the effect of management on dry matter allocation in cotton. The function may also be used to model organ-specific daily assimilate partitioning as a component in models of plant growth and crop production with the consideration of discussed caveats.

Undersowing winter oilseed rape with frost-sensitive legume living mulch: Consequences for cash crop nitrogen nutrition	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Biological nitrogen; Nitrogen mineralisation; Nitrogen-fertiliser recovery; Winter oilseed rape"	"GREEN MANURES; HAIRY VETCH; CORN; BARLEY; WATER; PEA; COMPETITION; DYNAMICS; TILLAGE; SYSTEM"	The use of legume cover crops as green manure is often seen as an effective means of supplying nitrogen to the following crop. As winter oilseed rape requires a large amount of N in the spring, the introduction of frost-sensitive legume living mulch (killed off during the winter) is a promising way of decreasing mineral N fertiliser inputs. The aim of this study was to assess the supply of biological N to rape during the spring from several frost-sensitive legumes, grown as intercropped living mulches. We carried out a field trial over two growing seasons before sowing, comparing seven legume species and three legume mixtures intercropped with rape, and two levels of soil mineral N. The presence of legumes, living during the autumn and dead during the spring, resulted in 20-40 kgN ha(-1) more nitrogen uptake in oilseed rape, by the end of flowering, compared to rape grown as a sole crop. Moreover, the use of N-15-labelled nitrogen fertiliser showed that this increase in rape N accumulation was due to the mineralisation of legume residues, but also to other mechanisms such as increase in fertiliser-N recovery and in soil organic matter mineralisation.

In this paper, we review studies that used Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to investigate the effects of reducing external inputs on the eco-efficiency of cropping systems, measured as the ratio of production to environmental impacts. We also review various cropping system interventions that can improve this ratio. Depending on the initial situation and the impacts considered, reducing inputs will in itself either reduce or increase environmental impacts per product unit-highly eco-efficient cropping systems require application of optimum instead of minimum quantities of external inputs. These optimum rates can be lowered by utilizing positive synergies between crops to minimise waste of nutrients and water and by utilizing locally produced organic waste; both from within the farm as well as well as from the surrounding sociotechnical environment. Eco-efficiency can also be improved by increasing yields in a sustainable matter. Strategies such as breeding, increasing diversity, no-tillage or intercropping will not be effective under all conditions. LCA provides a useful framework to identify environmentally optimum levels of inputs and trade-offs between various intensification scenarios."

However, it is unclear whether rice root exudates transfers to watermelon rhizosphere soil and whether AMF affects the transfer of rice root exudates to watermelon rhizosphere soil. A rhizobox experiment, with aerobic rice under (14) CO2, was conducted to investigate the effect of AMF colonization on carbon (C) transfer from rice to watermelon and on phosphorus (P) uptake by both watermelon and rice. The rhizobox was separated into labelling side (L side) and sampling side (S side) by inserting nylon mesh in the middle of the box. The L side was planted with aerobic rice, and the S side was aerobic rice (monocropping) or watermelon (intercropping). When (14) CO2 was added to rice canopy at the L side, (14) C activities of rice roots and rhizosphere soils in the L side were increased by intercropping with watermelon or AMF colonization. The (14) C was detected in roots and rhizosphere soils of rice and watermelon in the S side, but no differences were found among different treatments. (14) C activities in leaves were improved by AMF inoculation in the S side, regardless of rice or watermelon. Mycorrhizal colonization stimulated P absorption and translocation to rice in intercropping system. These findings suggest that AMF colonization could increase C transfer from rice to watermelon while intercropping with watermelon could promote AMF colonization and P uptake by rice.

Fusarium wilt of watermelon, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum (Fusarium oxysporum), drastically reduces watermelon yields in continuous cultivation systems, but it can be significantly alleviated using watermelon/aerobic rice intercropping system as shown by the research carried out in this laboratory. It is important to evaluate the interaction between root exudates from the two crops and the pathogen and thus to clarify the mechanism of disease suppressiveness in the intercropping system. The effects of phenolic acids, sugars and free amino acids in root exudates from watermelon (REW) and rice (RER) on the growth of Fusarium oxysporum were studied. The results obtained are listed as follows: (1) REW significantly increased spore germination and sporulation, whereas RER had inhibitory effects on those two parameters. (2) HPLC analysis showed that salicylic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid and phthalic acid were identified in exudates from both plants, but p-coumaric acid was only detected in rice and ferulic acid only in watermelon. Moreover, of the total rice exudates a high proportion (37.9 %) of p-coumaric acid was detected and the total amount of phenolic acids was 1.4-fold as high as that in watermelon. (3) Considerable differences in the components and contents of both sugars and amino acids were found between REW and RER exudates. (4) Exogenously applied alanine (Ala) increased spore germination and sporulation. In contrast, addition of exogenous p-coumaric acid reduced spore germination and sporulation, relative to controls. It was concluded that the rice root exudates had anti-fungal properties while that from watermelon promoted pathogen growth. This discovery provided a scientific basis for practicing watermelon/aerobic rice intercropping to control Fusarium wilt in watermelon.

Agronomic management options for phosphorus in Australian dryland organic and low-input cropping systems	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE			English	"Article; Proceedings Paper"	Workshop on Low P Farming Systems	2007	AUSTRALIA				"MICROBIAL COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; CONVENTIONAL FARMING SYSTEMS; ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; WHEAT-PASTURE ROTATIONS; GUINEA SAVANNA ZONE; P-UPTAKE EFFICIENCY; BRASSICA-NAPUS L.; LUPINUS-ALBUS L; SOIL-PHOSPHORUS; ROCK PHOSPHATE"	Maintenance of available phosphorus ( P) is a problem faced by both conventional and organic systems but it is exacerbated in the latter given that manufactured inorganic sources of P fertiliser are not permitted under the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements certification guidelines. The focus of this paper is a discussion of potential agronomic strategies to assist in sustainable management of the soil P resource in organic and low-input broadacre farming systems within the Australian rain-fed cereal-livestock belt. The paper considers three broad strategies for agronomic management of Pin this context and draws on reported research from overseas and within Australia. An analysis of the current knowledge suggests that the option most likely to ensure that soluble P is not a limitation in the system is the importation of allowable inputs that contain P from off-farm, although for much of the Australian cereal-livestock belt the immediate issue may be access to economically viable sources. Research targeted at quantifying the economic and biological benefits to the whole-farm system associated with the adoption of these practices is required. Improving the P-use efficiency of the system by incorporating species into rotation or intercropping systems that are able to use P from less soluble sources has been a successful strategy in parts of the world with climate similar to much of the Australian cereal-sheep belt, and deserves further research effort in Australia. Agronomic management to maximise quantity and quality of pasture and crop plant residues undoubtedly builds labile soil organic matter and facilitates P cycling, but the strategy maybe of limited benefit in low-rainfall areas that do not have the capacity to produce large biomass inputs. Evidence that organic or low-input systems naturally increase the numbers and diversity of soil organisms is sparse and published studies from Australian systems suggest that P nutrition is not enhanced. However, seed and soil microbial inoculants to facilitate improved P uptake have been developed and are currently being field tested in Australia. Progress in selection and breeding for cereal genotypes that are more P efficient and other plant genotypes that can use less labile P sources, is gaining momentum but still remains a long-term prospect, and may involve genetic modi. cation which will not be acceptable for organic systems.

Two experiments were conducted to investigate whether inoculation with the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Glomus versiforme can alleviate such competition and thus promote the growth of intercropped fruit trees by increasing soil nutrient exploitation. In the first experiment, intercropping was established in rhizoboxes containing sweet orange ( Citrus sinensis ) and the leguminous herb Stylosanthes gracilis inoculated with the AM fungus. Mycorrhizal inoculation did not appear to decrease competition, but increased the biomass of the herb much more than that of sweet orange. Inoculation had little effect on phosphorus (P) content of sweet orange, but significantly increased that of the legume roots. The AM fungal contribution to P uptake of the herb was twice that of sweet orange. Lateral roots of the herb tended to branch horizontally, with a large proportion entering the soil volume occupied by sweet orange; AM inoculation enhanced this effect. In Experiment 2, growth of the plants in monoculture revealed that the mycorrhizal dependency of the legume was much higher than that of sweet orange. It is suggested that mycorrhizal dependency can have a large influence on the role of the AM fungus in mediating competition in an intercropping system, and that fruit trees with high mycorrhizal dependency, together with a grass or herb with low mycorrhizal dependency, may be the optimum intercrop combination in orchards."

J	"Singh, HP; Batish, DR; Kohli, RK"				"Singh, HP; Batish, DR; Kohli, RK"			Allelopathic interactions and allelochemicals: New possibilities for sustainable weed management	CRITICAL REVIEWS IN PLANT SCIENCES			English	Review						"agroecosystems; allelochernicals; allelopathy; biotechnological means; cover crops; crop improvement; crop residues; cropping patterns; green manure crops; natural herbicides; smother crops; sustainable agriculture; weed management"	"RYE SECALE-CEREALE; WHEAT TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; ACTIVE SECONDARY METABOLITES; SOYBEAN GLYCINE-MAX; CORN ZEA-MAYS; ALFALFA MEDICAGO-SATIVA; SPEARGRASS IMPERATA-CYLINDRICA; HYACINTH EICHHORNIA-CRASSIPES; GROWTH-REGULATING ACTIVITIES; NONTOXIC FUNGAL METABOLITE"	Weeds are known to cause enormous losses due to their interference in agroecosystems. Because of environmental and human health concerns, worldwide efforts are being made to reduce the heavy reliance on synthetic herbicides that are used to control weeds. In this regard the phenomenon of allelopathy, which is expressed through the release of chemicals by a plant, has been suggested to be one of the possible alternatives for achieving sustainable weed management. The use of allelopathy for controlling weeds could be either through directly utilizing natural allelopathic interactions, particularly of crop plants, or by using allelochemicals as natural herbicides. In the former case, a number of crop plants with allelopathic potential can be used as cover, smother, and green manure crops for managing weeds by making desired manipulations in the cultural practices and cropping patterns. These can be suitably rotated or intercropped with main crops to manage the target weeds (including parasitic ones) selectively. Even the crop mulch/residues can also give desirable benefits. Not only the terrestrial weeds, even allelopathy can be suitably manipulated for the management of aquatic weeds. The allelochemicals present in the higher plants as well as in the microbes can be directly used for weed management on the pattern of herbicides. Their bioefficacy can be enhanced by structural changes or the synthesis of chemical analogues based on them. Further, in order to enhance the potential of allelopathic crops, several improvements can be made with the use of biotechnology or genomics and proteomics. In this context either the production of allelochemicals can be enhanced or the transgenics with foreign genes encoding for a particular weed-suppressing allelochemical could be produced. In the former, both conventional breeding and molecular genetical techniques are useful. However, with conventional breeding being slow and difficult, more emphasis is laid on the use of modem techniques such as molecular markers and the selection aided by them. Although the progress in this regard is slow, nevertheless some promising results are coining and more are expected in future. This review attempts to discuss all these aspects of allelopathy for the sustainable management of weeds.

Contribution of allelopathic effects to the overall weed suppression by different cover crops	WEED RESEARCH			English	Article						"allelopathy; Alopecurus myosuroides; intercropping; Stellaria media; Triticum aestivum; weed control"	"PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; ACTIVATED CARBON; GROWTH; BUCKWHEAT; GERMINATION; MANAGEMENT; ADSORPTION; CHARCOAL; UPDATE; RYE"	Cover crops can suppress weeds within agricultural fields due to competitive and allelopathic effects. Glasshouse experiments were conducted to evaluate the relative proportions of allelopathic effects to the total weed inhibition. Six different cover crop species were combined with three weed species in the presence or absence of active carbon over a period of four weeks. Active carbon was used as an adsorbent for allelopathic substances in the soil. Our study revealed that the competition between cover crops and weeds shifted, possibly due to the minimisation of allelopathic effects by active carbon in the soil. We assume that the degree of cover crops allelopathic effects on weeds is species-specific, both on the side of cover crops and on the weed side. The cover crops Raphanus sativus, Fagopyrum esculentum and Avena strigosa showed the highest allelopathic weed suppression with up to 28%. Additionally, Stellaria media turned out to be the most sensitive weed against allelopathic effects induced by all cover crops, except for Linum usitatissimum and Guizotia abyssinica. The knowledge about the contribution of competitive and allelopathic effects by cover crops would help to create cover crop mixtures with high weed suppressive ability.	"[Sturm, D.

Crucifer-legume cover crop mixtures are effective to obtain high nitrogen related services, but few data exist on their performances for S-related services. Our study aimed to assess performances of a wide variety of bispecific crucifer-legume mixtures designed to provide soil S catch-crop and S green-manure services. Methods A two-year field experiment was conducted at two sites near Toulouse, France (silt clay loam soil) and Orleans, France (sandy loam soil) in which cultivars from eight crucifer species and nine legume species were tested as sole and bispecific cover crops. Results Crucifer-legume mixtures and crucifer sole cover crops provided the same level of S catch-crop service (12 kg S ha(-1)), significantly higher than that of legume sole cover crops (4 kg S ha(-1)). Similarly, crucifer-legume mixtures provided almost the same level of S green-manure service (5.5 kg S ha(-1)) as crucifer sole cover crops (6.5 kg S ha(-1)). Conclusion Our results demonstrate the compatibility and complementarity of certain crucifer and legume species when grown together to provide S and N catch-crop and green-manure services. For a same cover crop species no strong cultivar effect has been highlighted in our growing conditions.

Influence of cultivars, cropping systems and nutrient levels on yield and quality of mango in north India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURE			English	Article						"Magnifera indica; cropping systems; fruit quality; intercropping"	"PRODUCTIVITY; PHOSPHORUS; FRUIT; PEA"	A field experiment was carried-out on 3-year-old mango trees (6 m x 6 m) during 2011-12 and 2012-13 at New Delhi to study the effect of cultivar, cropping system and nutrient level on yield and quality parameters. The experiment was laid out in a split-split-plot design with three replications. The main plots comprised of four cultivars, viz., Pusa Surya, Amrapali, Mallika and Dashehari, sub-plots consisted of four cropping systems, viz., vegetable cowpea-Indian mustard, green gram-Indian mustard, blackgram-Indian mustard and sole mango. Sub-sub plots included three fertility levels viz., control, 50% recommended dose of NPK fertilizers (RDF) + 50% recommended dose of FYM (RD-FYM), and 100% RDF + 100% RD-FYM to mango. A marked variation in fruit yield and fruit quality was observed among mango cultivars. 'Amrapali' exhibited supremacy over rest of the cultivars for yield and quality parameters. Under vegetable cowpea-mustard system, the mango fruit yield and yield parameters were comparatively higher. However, the physical and biochemical fruit quality parameters showed a non-significant variation among cropping systems. Application of 100% RDF + 100% RD-FYM remaining at par with 50% RDF + 50% RD-FYM produced significantly higher number of fruits/plant (16.5 and 24.3), fruit weight (212 and 223 g) and pulp: stone ratio (5.01 and 5.02) during 2011-12 and 2012-13, respectively over control. Application of 100% RDF + 100% RD-FYM exhibited higher biochemical quality parameters viz., TSS, vitamin C, total carotenoids and total sugars during both years over other treatments. Overall, 'Amrapali', vegetable cowpea-mustard cropping system and application of 100% RDF + 100% RD-FYM were the best performing treatments in terms of fruit yield and quality parameters in the current study.

However, tillage is difficult to combine with a growing crop, which limits its application. The aim of this study was to evaluate how soil vertical cutting with minimum soil disturbance and mowing affect the growth and competitive ability of E. repens in a grass-clover crop. A tractor-drawn prototype with vertical disks was used to fragment E. repens rhizomes with minimal soil and crop disturbance. In experiments performed in 2014 and 2015 at a field site close to Uppsala, Sweden, the rhizomes were fragmented before crop sowing (ERF), during crop growth (LRF), or both (ERF+LRF). Fragmentation was combined with repeated mowing (yes/no) and four companion crop treatments (none, Italian ryegrass, white clover, and grass/clover mixture). The results showed that in the grass-clover crop, rhizome fragmentation reduced E. repens rhizome biomass production and increased Italian ryegrass shoot biomass. ERF and LRF both reduced E. repens rhizome biomass by about 38% compared with the control, while ERF+LRF reduced it by 63%. Italian ryegrass shoot biomass was increased by 78% by ERF, 170% by LRF and 200% by ERF+LRF. Repeated mowing throughout the experiment reduced E. repens rhizome biomass by about 75%. Combining repeated mowing with rhizome fragmentation did not significantly increase the control effect compared to mowing alone. We concluded that rhizome fragmentation using vertical disks can be used both before sowing and during crop growth to enhance the controlling effect of grass-clover crops on E. repens.

In the scenario of conventional farming system, limited chances are available to cope with these issues. Relay cropping is a method of multiple cropping where one crop is seeded into standing second crop well before harvesting of second crop. Relay cropping may solve a number of conflicts such as inefficient use of available resources, controversies in sowing time, fertilizer application, and soil degradation. Relay cropping is a complex suite of different resource-efficient technologies, which possesses the capability to improve soil quality, to increase net return, to increase land equivalent ratio, and to control the weeds and pest infestation. The current review emphasized relay cropping as a tool for crop diversification and environmental sustainability with special focus on soil. Briefly, benefits, constraints, and opportunities of relay cropping keeping the goals of higher crop productivity and sustainability have also been discussed in this review. The research and knowledge gap in relay cropping was also highlighted in order to guide the further studies in future.

Field studies were performed, in order to investigate the weed suppressing ability of Medicago lupulina, Trifolium subterraneum and a mixture of Lolium perenne and Festuca pratensis as living mulches in sugar beet at four locations in South Germany during 2014 and 2015. Living mulches were sown 2 and 30 days after sowing (DAS) of sugar beet. Weed densities ranged from 0 to 143 plants m-2 with Chenopodium album, Polygonum convolvulus and Polygonum aviculare being the most abundant weed species. It has been found that living mulches could reduce herbicide input up to 65%. Weed suppression of living mulch was highest with Trifolium subterraneum (71%). The early sown living mulches (2 DAS) revealed a 28 g m(-2) higher biomass compared to late sowing (30 DAS). However, no any linear correlation was found between living mulch biomass and weed suppression. White sugar yield (WSY) was highest in the herbicide treatments (12.6 t ha(-1)). Trifolium subterraneum yielded the highest WSY of the living mulches with 11.1 t ha(-1) across all locations. Our work reveals that living mulch can play a major role in integrated plant protection by reducing herbicides in sugar beet production.

Therefore, over the past few years in many countries, there has been a growing trend toward conservation agriculture (CA) to enhance sustainability without compromising land productivity. Three important pillars of CA are minimal tillage operations, permanent residue cover, and rotation of primary crops. Adoption of CA, however, influences weed populations differently from conventional agriculture. Weed control in CA is a greater challenge than in conventional agriculture because there is no weed seed burial by tillage operations and soil-applied herbicides are not incorporated, resulting in reduced efficacy. The behavior of weeds and their interaction with crops under CA tend to be complex and not fully understood. A large proportion of weed seed bank remains generally on or close to the soil surface after crop sowing under CA. Weed species, in which germination is stimulated by light, are likely to be more problematic in CA. In addition, in the absence of tillage, perennial weeds may also become more challenging in this system. On the other hand, weed seeds present on the soil surface are more prone to desiccation and greater predation activity of insects, especially ants. Crop residues, when uniformly and densely present, under CA could suppress weed seedling emergence, delay the time of emergence, and allow the crop to gain an initial advantage in terms of early vigor over weeds. Where pre-emergence herbicides are applied, crop residues may also intercept a considerable proportion of the applied herbicide and may result in lower herbicide efficacy. Approaches such as stale seedbed practice, uniform and dense crop establishment, use of cover crops and crop residues as mulch, crop rotations, and practices for enhanced crop competiveness with a combination of pre- and post-emergence herbicides could be integrated to develop sustainable and effective weed management strategies under CA systems.

In Finland, undersowing is a suitable method for establishing cover crops in cereals. The effect of annual undersowing on soil nitrate N was studied at two sites. Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), white clover (Trifolium repens L.), a mixture of red clover and meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.), and westerwold ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam. var. westerwoldicum) were undersown in spring cereals during six successive seasons, and a pure stand of cereal was grown in two years after that. In all years, the soil nitrate N was measured in late autumn, and in addition in different times of the season in last four years. The effect of undersowing on soil NO3-N content was generally low, but in one season when conditions favoured high N leaching, westerwold ryegrass decreased soil NO3-N. The negligible increase of N leaching risk in connection with undersowing clovers, associated with late autumn ploughing, supports the use of clovers to increase the cereal grain yield. The highest levels of soil NO3-N were recorded at sowing in spring irrespective of whether a crop was undersown or not. NO3-N contents were higher in sandy soil than in silt. Undersowing can be done annually in cereal cultivation either to fix or catch N. No cumulative effects on soil nitrate N were associated with undersowing after six years.

The amount of N-2 fixed is primarily controlled by four principal factors: (1) the effectiveness of the rhizobia-host plant symbiosis, (2) the strength of the sink, i.e., the ability of the host plant to accumulate N, (3) the amount of available soil N and (4) environmental constraints to N-2 fixation. Much of the N fixed by grain legumes is removed at harvest, the remainder becomes available to subsequent crops following mineralization, may be incorporated into the soil organic matter, or as with fertilizer N, may be lost from the cropping system. This paper reviews some of the agronomic management practices that affect N-2 fixation by grain legumes, asking whether grain legumes can provide an overall net N benefit to the soil when grown in rotation with other crops. A survey of long-term trends in N-2 fixation by selected grain legumes is included, and some possible explanations for the observed stagnation in efforts to increase N-2 fixation under field conditions are presented.

These largely extractive farming systems have resulted in nutrient depletion, soil fertility decline, low productivity and land degradation. A study conducted over 25 years in Niger, aimed to evaluate the long-term effects of organic and mineral fertilizers, cropping systems (CS) of millet and cowpea on crop productivity. The traditional millet/cowpea inter crop system without P fertilizer (TrM/C) was compared with four improved CS receiving P fertilizer: sole millet (MM), millet/cowpea intercrop (M/C), millet-cowpea rotation (M-C), and M/C and rotation with cowpea (M/CC). Nitrogen fertilizer (N) and the residues of millet (CR) were applied alone or in combination in all five cropping systems. CR were always applied as mulch. The traditional system (TrM/C) produced the lowest millet grain yields (GY) (0.02-0.43 t/ha). All the four improved CS (MM, M/C, M-C and M/C-C) increased GY compared with the traditional system (TrM/C). The M/C and MM systems increased millet GY 3 and 3.3 times compared with the TrM/C, respectively. The M/C-C and M-C systems produced 4 and 4.2 times more GY than that of the TrM/C system, respectively. The lowest revenue was obtained with the TrM/C system. Except for the TrM/C, the revenue of the MM system was lower compared with combined cultivation of millet and cowpea. Compared with the TrM/C system, M/C and M/C-C provided 2 times more revenue. By providing 2.4 times more revenue than the TrM/C system, the M-C system was the most productive system. Cowpea provided from 54% and 56% of the revenue in M/C-C and M-C system, respectively. Soil organic carbon decreased in all the CS from 46% to 63% compared with the soil kept under natural vegetation fallow. The improved CS increased soil P from 3.4 to 4 times. Over the 25 years of cropping, the highest millet yields were obtained with the lower levels of rainfall indicating the role of nutrients in the system. The four improved systems maintained millet yields over the 25 years of cropping. By improving water and nutrient use efficiency, integrated management of mineral fertilizers, CR and cowpea affected more crop productivity than the rainfall. We concluded that cereal-legume based cropping systems treated with small doses of mineral fertilizers and CR could be used for sustainable management of soil fertility in low-input farming systems.

Thus, the objective was to evaluate the release of nutrients from different manure types and the nutrient accumulation in forage cactus across different cropping systems. Different manure sources (cattle, goat, sheep, and broiler litter) were evaluated for the following cropping systems: (i) Gliricidia sepium intercropped with cactus cv. IPA-Sertania; (ii) Leucaena leucocephala intercropped with cactus cv. IPA-Sertania; and (iii) Cactus cv. IPA-Sertania in monoculture, in the tropical semiarid region of Brazil. The rate of decomposition and release of N, P, and K from manure was determined by incubating a litterbag, evaluated in different periods (0, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256 days). Broiler litter released the greatest amount of N and P. Sheep manure released the greatest amounts of K. The greatest accumulations of N, P, and K in cactus biomass occurred when broiler litter was applied. Cactus monoculture accumulated less N over 256 days, indicating that the presence of tree legumes favors the accumulation of N in cactus. Broiler litter promoted the best synchronism between N release and N uptake in different cropping systems."

Mechanistic simulation models are powerful tools to reach this goal. Our objective was to integrate plant-plant competition for nitrogen into the preexisting FLORSYS model simulating the effects of cropping systems on weed dynamics and crop production. The formalisms were either created or inspired from other models and adapted to make them compatible with the individualbased representation of FLORSYS. Plant nitrogen uptake was simulated by confronting plant nitrogen demand (driven by shoot growth) to plant nitrogen supply (depending on root characteristics, soil-nitrogen availability and the presence of neighboring plants with roots in the same soil zone). A nitrogen stress index allowed accounting for the impact of plant nitrogen nutrition on plant photosynthesis, biomass allocation and morphology. The new formalisms consisted of only seven species-specific parameters. Despite simplifying hypotheses in formalisms, predictions were in good agreement with knowledge on canopy functioning and crop-weed interactions. We provide the first mechanistic cropping system model focusing on weeds that simulates plant-plant competition for nitrogen (in addition to competition for light). It will be useful to understand the role of nitrogen in crop-weed interactions and identify agroecological management strategies promoting weed regulation by competition.

Field stationary experiment was conducted between 2016 and 2019 with potato in a crop rotation system on leached chernozem soil. Farmyard manure, 40 t/ha, applied prior to potatoes planting promotes nitrogen fixation (0.8-2.0 times compared to control). However, it has also affected denitrification (in 1.4-2.2 times higher compared to control). The lowest rate of mineral fertilizers used in the experiment, N40P40K40, was shown as most environmentally feasible. Under its use the increase of soil nitrogenase activity and low denitrification levels were observed. Same trends were also noted for the medium fertilizer rate, N80P80K80. The highest doses of mineral fertilizers, N120P120K120, substantially affected the denitrification process and reduced the nitrogen fixation activity (in 1.9-2.2 times). The combination of manure with the medium fertilizers rate has also resulted in high denitrification levels, while the soil nitrogen fixation activity has restored only at flowering stage. Crop inoculation with A. brasilense combined with the manure application, has not affected studied processes. However, crop inoculation after the green manure intercropping has shown the growth of nitrogenase activity. Used on the mineral fertilizers background inoculation has activated nitrogen fixation and has ensured the decrease of denitrification levels, subject to the fertilization background. High fertilizer rates have hampered the inoculation efficiency. Inoculation has promoted crop yields on unfertilized and mineral backgrounds or following green manure. Crop inoculation following organic and the organo-mineral backgrounds had no significant effect, probably due to the competition for A. brasilense from microorganisms that have created a competitive environment for A. brasilense. Despite its environmental expediency, inoculation combined with the low fertilizer doses underperforms the action of inoculation combined with the medium fertilizer rates showing the latter as the compromise between the environmental requirements and crop productivity. The use of inoculation has promoted the accumulation of starch and ascorbic acid and has contributed to the reduction of nitrate contents in the tubers of inoculated plants.

A discrete choice experiment was conducted in the Hexi Corridor (D1) and the west Loess Plateau (D2) in northwest China. The results show that farmers in D1 preferred intercropping and rotating cover crops to the current single cropping system, while farmers in D2 prioritized intercropping over rotation and least preferred planting cover crops in marginal land in the double-cropping system. Farmers in both sites preferred 1 or 3 years of adoption over 5 years. Additionally, farmers in D2 preferred technical assistance to reduce the high proportion of agrochemicals. The results indicate that younger farmers with higher annual household incomes were most likely to opt out in D1. In D2, more agricultural labor inputs and raising livestock had positive effects on the adoption of the package. Moreover, farmers who cultivated cash crops were more reluctant to move away from the current cropping system. This study highlights the uses of cover crop intercropping and rotation combining with technical assistance in different agriculturally intensive cropping systems that may be useful in guiding site-specific policy.

More specifically, we examined the effect of informational messages on consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for lentils bearing different production labels. Study participants were given two generic messages designed to promote lentils as a general product with nutritional and environmental benefits. These messages were followed by two specific messages related to one lentil packet with revealed information about the use of certain agricultural practices (e.g., intercropping, organic and local production, and producer partnerships). Initial WTP were measured before the information was provided. The results show that labeling had a strong influence on initial WTP. When WTP were measured after the participants had received the generic and specific informational messages, we observed a weak but significant influence for the lentils with organic and local production labels. There was no effect for the lentils without any production labels. We thus conclude that providing generic information via official recommendations and further developing legume labeling systems could act synergistically to drive some weak changes in consumer choices.

Soil water balance models for determining crop water and irrigation requirements and irrigation scheduling focusing on the FAO56 method and the dual K-c approach	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Article						"Crop coefficients; Crop evapotranspiration; Dual K-c approach; Real time irrigation management; Water use assessment; SIMDualKc model"	"DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; PENMAN-MONTEITH; COEFFICIENT APPROACH; ROOT-ZONE; DEFICIT IRRIGATION; ECONOMIC RETURNS; WINTER-WHEAT; ESTIMATING EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; ESTIMATING EVAPORATION; MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES"	This study reviews soil water balance (SWB) model approaches to determine crop irrigation requirements and scheduling irrigation adopting the FAO56 method. The K-c-ETo approach is discussed with consideration of baseline concepts namely standard vs. actual K-c concepts, as well as single and dual K-c approaches. Requirements for accurate SWB and appropriate parameterization and calibration are introduced. The one-step vs. the two-step computational approaches is discussed before the review of the FAO56 method to compute and partition crop evapotranspiration and related soil water balance. A brief review on transient state models is also included. Baseline information is concluded with a discussion on yields prediction and performance indicators related to water productivity. The study is continued with an overview on models development and use after publication of FAO24, essentially single K-c models, followed by a review on models following FAO56, particularly adopting the dual K-c approach. Features of dual K-c modeling approaches are analyzed through a few applications of the SWB model SIMDualKc, mainly for derivation of basal and single K-c, extending the basal K-c approach to relay intercrop cultivation, assessing alternative planting dates, determining beneficial and non beneficial uses of water by an irrigated crop, and assessing the groundwater contribution to crop ET in the presence of a shallow water table. The review finally discusses the challenges placed to SWB modeling for real time irrigation scheduling, particularly the new modeling approaches for large scale multi-users application, use of cloud computing and adopting the internet of things (IoT), as well as an improved wireless association of modeling with soil and plant sensors. Further challenges refer to the use of remote sensing energy balance and vegetation indices to map K-c, ET and crop water and irrigation requirements. Trends are expected to change research issues relative to SWB modeling, with traditional models mainly used for research while new, fast responding and multi-users models based on cloud and IoT technologies will develop into applications to the farm practice. Likely, the K-c-ETo will continue to be used, with ETo from gridded networks, re-analysis and other sources, and K-c data available in real time from large databases and remote sensing.	"[Pereira, L.

Composition analysis revealed that a total of 16 compounds with possible antioxidant activity were contained in the obtained EEC, such as bergaptol, curcumenol, viscutin, homobutein, nissolicarpin, and 4-hydroxyisopimpinellin. Similar to tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), EEC inhibited the increases in acid value, carbonyl value, and total polar compound content of frying oil during frying. The decrease in content of polyunsaturated fatty acids and the increase in content of saturated fatty acids were also significantly inhibited in TBHQ-added or EEC-added oils. More than 45 % of the reduction in concentration of octanoic acid was obtained in EEC-added oils, which was comparable to those observed in TBHQ-added oils. Thermal oxidative degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids was proven to be retarded by adding EEC and TBHQ to moderate the deterioration of frying oil. Thus, the potential use of EEC as a natural antioxidant was demonstrated to extend the usage life of vegetable oils with a high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids during frying.

The objective of this study is to understand the briquetting characteristics of woody and herbaceous biomass blends, which might result from intercropping. Tests were conducted on blends of lodgepole pine, switchgrass, and corn stover biomass using three hammer mill screen sizes (i.e., 4.8, 12.7, and 19.05 mm), three blend moistures (12%, 15%, and 18%, w.b.), and two- and three-blend ratios (i.e., 1:1 and 1:1:1) using a pilot-scale hydraulic briquette press. The briquette properties, such as unit and bulk density, durability rating after 5 days of storage (as they tend to attain stable density), and the energy consumption of the process were measured. The results indicate that moisture content of 12% and 15% (w.b.) and smaller hammer mill screen size of 4.8 mm increased the unit and bulk densities to >750 and >430 kg/m(3)and moisture content (15% and 18% (w.b.)) and hammer mill screen size of 12.7 and 19.05 mm produced briquettes with durability rating values of >95%. The higher moisture content of 18% (w.b.) and the hammer mill screen size of 12.7 and 19.05 mm had the highest energy consumption. The proximate and ultimate analysis showed that energy content improved by blending lodgepole pine with both corn stover and switchgrass and also showed increased calorific value and reduced ash content. Scanning electron microscopy micrographs showed interlocking of particles and cracks in the briquettes.

Given this, in this study, we assess the soil rehabilitation in a bauxite-mined area after three years of the field experiment installation through the determination of the total and labile C and N contents, in addition to the carbon management index (CMI), in soil and in stable aggregates separated into three classes (macro: 4.75-2.0 mm, meso: 2.00-0.25 mm and micro: 0.25-0.053 mm). Among the rehabilitation strategies, different combinations of fertilizations and ground cover plants intercropping with coffee, were evaluated. Results revealed that among all the treatments with fertilization, the highest water-stable macroaggregates (+80%), MWDW (2.86 mm), GMD(W) (2.02 mm), AGRI(W) (81.48%) and SAI(W) (89.21%) in the 0-20 cm soil layer were recorded in organic fertilization + brachiaria treatment (OF/B), close to native vegetation (NV). These indices were characterized as good indicators of macroaggregation and soil quality; however, the mesoaggregates reflected the differences in the dynamics of C and N due to the influence of management systems. In the soil, the plots under organic and chemical fertilization + brachiaria (OF + CF/B) had more TOC (22.11), TN (1.49), LOC (1.44), LN (0.054) g kg(-1), respectively, and CMI (33.06%). Significant effect of the OF + CF fertilization was only observed in aggregate size of meso and microaggregates. TOC and TN contents were higher in the mesoaggregates, but not higher than the soil, however, LOC and CMI had higher values in the macroaggregates, higher than the soil. In general, when OF/B was used, the macroaggregation increased by 27.6%, MWDw (7.51%), the GMDw (48.52%), and OF + CF/B, the TOC (63%) and TN (67%) in relation to the pre-mined area. CMI is very effective in evaluating the best management systems to recover degraded areas, such as areas of mineral extraction, and the best indicators of this index were evaluated in the aggregate classes. The estimation of CMI values and analysis of organic attributes in aggregate classes can be used to ascertain the impacts of management practices and how they aid in the recovery of the physical quality of soil in the rehabilitation phase. The application of the organic and/or organic and chemical fertilization with brachiaria may represent an option for the sustainability of the system by the reconditioning of the organic attributes of the soil in mineral exploration area."

The role of legumes in the sustainable intensification of African smallholder agriculture: Lessons learnt and challenges for the future	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Review						"Best-fit technologies; Biological N-2 fixation; Legume agronomy; Legume-rhizobium symbiosis; Rhizobium inoculants; Rotational benefits"	"BIOLOGICAL NITROGEN-FIXATION; SOIL FERTILITY MANAGEMENT; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; RESOURCE USE EFFICIENCY; ZEA-MAYS L; BRADYRHIZOBIUM-JAPONICUM; GRAIN LEGUMES; N-2 FIXATION; SYMBIOTIC PERFORMANCE; PROMISCUOUS SOYBEANS"	Grain legumes play a key role in smallholder farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), in relation to food and nutrition security and income generation. Moreover, because of their N-2-fixation capacity, such legumes can also have a positive influence on soil fertility. Notwithstanding many decades of research on the agronomy of grain legumes, their N-2-fixation capacity, and their contribution to overall system productivity, several issues remain to be resolved to realize fully the benefits of grain legumes. In this paper we highlight major lessons learnt and expose key knowledge gaps in relation to grain legumes and their contributions to farming system productivity. The symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia forms the basis for its benefits and biological N-2-fixation (BNF) relies as much on the legume genotype as on the rhizobial strains. As such, breeding grain legumes for BNF deserves considerably more attention. Even promiscuous varieties usually respond to inoculation, and as African soils contain a huge pool of unexploited biodiversity with potential to contribute elite rhizobial strains, strain selection should go hand-in-hand with legume breeding for N-2-fixation. Although inoculated strains can outcompete indigenous strains, our understanding of what constitutes a good competitor is rudimentary, as well as which factors affect the persistence of inoculated rhizobia, which in its turn determines whether a farmer needs to re-inoculate each and every season. Although it is commonly assumed that indigenous rhizobia are better adapted to local conditions than elite strains used in inoculants, there is little evidence that this is the case. The problems of delivering inoculants to smallholders through poorly-developed supply chains in Africa necessitates inoculants based on sterile carriers with long shelf life. Other factors critical for a well-functioning symbiosis are also central to the overall productivity of grain legumes. Good agronomic practices, including the use of phosphorus (P)-containing fertilizer, improve legume yields though responses to inputs are usually very variable. In some situations, a considerable proportion of soils show no response of legumes to applied inputs, often referred to as non-responsive soils. Understanding the causes underlying this phenomenon is limited and hinders the uptake of legume agronomy practices. Grain legumes also contribute to the productivity of farming systems, although such effects are commonly greater in rotational than in intercropping systems. While most cropping systems allow for the integration of legumes, intercropped legumes provide only marginal benefits to associated crops. Important rotational benefits have been shown for most grain legumes though those with the highest N accumulation and lowest N harvest index appear to demonstrate higher residual benefits. N balance estimates often results in contradictory observations, mostly caused by the lack of understanding of belowground contributions of legumes to the N balance. Lastly, the ultimate condition for increased uptake of grain legumes by smallholder farmers lies in the understanding of how legume technologies and management practices can be tailored to the enormous diversity of agroecologies, farming systems, and smallholder farms in SSA. In conclusion, while research on grain legumes has revealed a number of important insights that will guide realization of the full potential of such legumes to the sustainable intensification of smallholder farming systems in SSA, many research challenges remain to be addressed to realize the full potential of BNF in these systems.

Argentina ranks third in area of saline soils in the world, with a third of its territory showing various degrees of salinity, sodicity and/or alkalinity. On this type of soils, rangelands are the main forage resource for livestock production. Many wild species have forage potential and can also be used for the rehabilitation of rangelands and for intercropping. Information about these species, as well as on the physiological and genetic bases associated with salinity tolerance, provides relevant tools for efficient selection methods. This study addresses Argentine wild halophyte species with forage potential and describes selection criteria with an emphasis on the following taxa: (a) Poaceae: subfamily Chloridoideae and tribes Paniceae and Triticeae, (b) Fabaceae and (c) Amaranthaceae (formerly known as Chenopodiaceae). The review is intended to contribute to the general discussion on strategies for the improvement of wild plant genetic resources, using forage species naturally growing in saline soils in Argentina as a case study.

We evaluated if subsidiary crops (SCs, e.g., cover crops) can mitigate the effects of non-inversion tillage on weed abundance. Two-year experiments studying SC use, tillage intensity, and nitrogen (N) fertilization level were carried out twice at six sites throughout northern and central Europe. SCs significantly reduced weed cover throughout the intercrop period (-55% to -1% depending on site), but only slightly during the main crops. Overall weed abundance and weed biomass were higher when using non-inversion tillage with SCs compared to inversion tillage without SCs. The effects differed due to site-specific weed pressure and management. With increasing weed pressure, the effect of SCs decreased, and the advantage of inversion over non-inversion tillage increased. N fertilization level did not affect weed abundance. The results suggest that SCs can contribute by controlling weeds but cannot fully compensate for reduced weed control of non-inversion tillage in the transition phase. Using non-inversion tillage together with SCs is primarily recommended in low weed pressure environments.

However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not been fully elucidated. This study was designed to assess the role of microorganisms inhabiting Allium rhizospheres and antifungal compounds produced by Allium roots in Fusarium wilt suppression by Allium cultivation. Suppression of cucumber Fusarium wilt and the pathogen multiplication by Allium (Welsh onion and/or onion)-cultivated soils were eliminated by heat treatment at 60 degrees C, whereas those by Welsh onion-root extract were lost at 40 degrees C. The addition of antibacterial antibiotics eliminated the suppressive effect of Welsh onion-cultivated soil on pathogen multiplication, suggesting the contribution of antagonistic gram-negative bacteria to the soil suppressiveness. The Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons revealed that genus Flavobacterium was the predominant group that preferentially accumulated in Allium rhizospheres. Flavobacterium species recovered from the rhizosphere soils of these Allium plants suppressed Fusarium wilt on cucumber seedlings. Furthermore, confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that Flavobacterium isolates inhibited the multiplication of the pathogen in soil. Taken together, we infer that the accumulation of antagonistic Flavobacterium species plays a key role in Fusarium wilt suppression by Allium cultivation.

Notwithstanding the importance of this crop, yam production has been stagnating, threatening rural livelihoods and food security. Contrary to traditional yam systems in Ghana, an alternative system that integrates pigeonpea and yam is being proposed to mitigate constraints in existing yam production system through replenishing soil fertility, the provision of stakes for staking, and providing nutritious grains to farmers. The purpose of this study was to explore farmers' constraints and determine farmers' knowledge of the pigeonpea-yam cropping system. The investigation was conducted using structured questionnaires on a sample consisting of 150 yam farmers from three major yam-producing districts of Ghana. Results revealed that access to capital, mechanization, and poor road network were among the main constraints that militated yam production. A majority (68%) farmers are also still using shifting cultivation in search of fertile lands for yam production. The study found that farmers had poor knowledge of the pigeonpea-yam cropping system and the benefits and uses of pigeonpea. Given the potential of the pigeonpea-yam intercropping system in addressing soil fertility and providing a readily available source of stakes, it would be a viable option for smallholder farmers to increase and sustain production.

The results showed that developing leaves under MS exhibited the higher leaf area and leaf mass than that of WS. Blade thickness, palisade tissue thickness, sponge tissue thickness, cell size, cell numbers, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, and cytokinin content of developing leaves under MS were lower, while auxin and gibberellin contents were higher than that of NS.

In East Africa these two crops are economically important and are commonly intercropped by smallholder farmers. The role of host plant volatiles in M. incognita interactions with these two commodities is currently unknown. Here, we investigate the olfactory basis of attraction of tomato and spinach roots by the infective second stage juveniles (J2s) of M. incognita. In olfactometer assays, J2s were attracted to root volatiles from both crops over moist sand (control), but in choice tests using the two host plants, volatiles of tomato roots were more attractive than those released by spinach. Root volatiles sampled by solid phase microextraction (SPME) fiber and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) identified a total of eight components, of which five (2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine, 2-(methoxy)-3-(1-methylpropyl)pyrazine, tridecane, and alpha- and beta-cedrene) occurred in the root-emitted volatiles of both plants, with three (delta-3-carene, sabinene, and methyl salicylate) being specific to tomato root volatiles. In a series of bioassays, methyl salicylate contributed strongly to the attractiveness of tomato, whereas 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine and tridecane contributed to the attractiveness of spinach. M. incognita J2s were also more attracted to natural spinach root volatiles when methyl salicylate was combined than to spinach volatiles alone, indicating that the presence of methyl salicylate in tomato volatiles strongly contributes to its preference over spinach. Our results indicate that since both tomato and spinach roots are attractive to M. incognita, identifying cultivars of these two plant species that are chemically less attractive can be helpful in the management of root knot nematodes.

Four peak SNP loci located on chromosome D03 were simultaneously associated with more plant architecture component traits. A candidate gene, Gh_D03G0922, might be responsible for plant height in upland cotton. Abstract A compact plant architecture is increasingly required for mechanized harvesting processes in China. Therefore, cotton plant architecture is an important trait, and its components, such as plant height, fruit branch length and fruit branch angle, affect the suitability of a cultivar for mechanized harvesting. To determine the genetic basis of cotton plant architecture, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using a panel composed of 355 accessions and 93,250 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified using the specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing method. Thirty significant associations between 22 SNPs and five plant architecture component traits were identified via GWAS. Most importantly, four peak SNP loci located on chromosome D03 were simultaneously associated with more plant architecture component traits, and these SNPs were harbored in one linkage disequilibrium block. Furthermore, 21 candidate genes for plant architecture were predicted in a 0.95-Mb region including the four peak SNPs. One of these genes (Gh_D03G0922) was near the significant SNP D03_31584163 (8.40 kb), and its Arabidopsis homologs contain MADS-box domains that might be involved in plant growth and development. qRT-PCR showed that the expression of Gh_D03G0922 was upregulated in the apical buds and young leaves of the short and compact cotton varieties, and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) proved that the silenced plants exhibited increased PH. These results indicate that Gh_D03G0922 is likely the candidate gene for PH in cotton. The genetic variations and candidate genes identified in this study lay a foundation for cultivating moderately short and compact varieties in future Chinese cotton-breeding programs.

However, it is not clear if mepiquat chloride (MC) application is still necessary in the new system. We hypothesized that MC application might reduce leaf photosynthesis and economic yield and thus not be necessary in the new system. To test the hypothesis, short-season cotton was sown in mid-May at 10 plants m(-2) and with 225 kg N ha(-1) applied at early flowering, and MC was applied three times at five main-stem leaf intervals initiated from the 6th leaf stage at five dosages (MCO, MC30, MC60, MC90, and MC120 represent 0,30, 60,90, and 120 g ha(-1), respectively) in a 2-year experiment The photosynthesis, chlorophyll contents, carbohydrate contents, carbohydrate metabolic enzyme dynamics, and cotton yield under different MC treatments were determined. Photosynthesis was reduced by 1-28% and lint yield decreased by 6-29% as MC dosage increased. However, chlorophyll a, b, a + b, sucrose, glucose, fructose, and starch contents in the 4th leaf from the top were increased by 3-56%, 2-45%, 3-51%, 4-48%, 3-48%, 2-63%, and 2-43%, respectively. The activities of enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism decreased by 2-25% for sucrose phosphate synthase, but increased by 2-40%, 2-30%, and 3-52% for sucrose synthase, soluble acid invertase, and neutral invertase, respectively. These findings suggest that increased accumulation of sucrose, hexose, and starch in the leaf with MC application diminished photosynthesis and thus could explain the yield loss. Therefore, MC application is not necessary for late-planted cotton.

Spiders are an abundant and successful group of natural predators that are considered efficient in the biocontrol of the major insect pests in agroecosystems. Spider diversity in different stages of the rice crop growth from eastern Uruguay was analysed. Field study was developed on six rice farms with rotation system with pasture, installed during intercropping stage as cover crop. Six rice crops distributed in three locations were sampled with pitfall and entomological vaccum suction machine. Sixteen families, representing six guilds, were collected. Lycosidae, Linyphiidae, Anyphaenidae and Tetragnathidae were the most abundant families (26%, 25%, 20% and 12%, respectively) and comprised more than 80% of total abundance. Other hunters (29%), sheet web weavers (25%) and ground hunters (24%) were the most abundant guilds. Species composition along different crop stages was significantly different according to the ANOSIM test. The results showed higher spider abundance and diversity along the crop and intercrop stages. This study represents the first contribution to the knowledge of spider diversity associated with rice agroecosystem in the country.

In this study, we investigated the impact of living mulch in cereal crops on weed density and grain yield. Seven field experiments were conducted in Southwestern Germany. Perennial ryegrass and white clover were sown on the same day as the cereal crop (early) and when cereals had produced 3-5 leaves or the first tillers (late). Average weed density in the control plots without living mulch was 45 weeds m(-2). Perennial ryegrass and white clover significantly reduced weed density to 22 plants m(-2) and 25 plants m(-2). Sowing date of living mulch had no effect on weed density. Grain yield was equal in all treatments. The results show that living mulch can suppress weeds without competing with the cereal crop.

The soil under the experiment was silty loam Planosol (Endohypogleyic-Eutric - Pie-gln-w). The research objective was to determine the influence of different non-chemical weed control treatments on soil and sugar beet root chemical composition under organic farming conditions. Six weed control methods were tested: inter-row loosening (CT, control treatment), cutting and mulching with weeds (MW), Persian clover (MC), white mustard (MM) and spring barley (MB), inter-row steaming (ST). According to the results of the investigation, during the two plant growing seasons, the accumulated biomass of inter-row plants positively influenced the content of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the soil, but decreased the proportion of magnesium and sulfur. Inter-row loosening (control treatment) positively affected nearly all the tested soil chemical properties (especially total nitrogen and magnesium), except for the content of sulfur. Although inter-row mulching with weeds drastically decreased the content of phosphorus, the concentration of potassium increased. Mulching with the Persian clover improved the contents of total nitrogen and available potasshim. However, this impact was common. Mulching with white mustard significantly increased the contents of potassium and magnesium. Similar results were found in the plots with spring barley living mulch. In the steamed plots, due to the lack of plant residues, the soil properties did not improve and the losses of phosphorus and magnesium were the highest in the entire experiment. Different non-chemical weed control methods decreased the yield and the sucrose content in sugar beet roots. The content of potassium, sodium and alpha amino nitrogen in the roots did not significantly depend on the methods of weed control.

Field experiments were carried out on two cropping systems (rapeseed-rice rotation and rice-rice continuously) between July 2015 and October 2015. Laboratory tests were conducted to compare rapeseed-rice rotation with rice-rice continuous cropping as the control to investigate enzyme activity and the structure of bacterial communities in the soils. Two sets of soil samples were collected and tested to show that, compared to rice-rice, the catalase, urease, phosphatase and cellulase contents of the soil from rapeseedrice rotation are increased by 11.92, 24.94, 18.80 and 20.34%, respectively, and the sucrase content decreased by 17.93%. DNA from soil microbial communities was extracted for analysis of microbial diversity using the high-throughput sequencing technique. Microbial communities in the rapeseed-rice soil were significantly different in composition to those in the rice-rice soil. Crop rotation increased the size of bacterial populations and altered their proportionality in the bacterial community and decreased the population size of Chlorobi and Chloroflexi. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that there are significant differences in bacterial population size between the two cropping systems. Firmicutes, Latescibacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Gemmatimonadetes and Acidobacteria were the principal driving force microorganisms. Rape-rice soil showed more Firmicutes and Latescibacteria in the July samples and Gemmatimonadetes and Acidobacteria in the October samples whereas the rice-rice soil showed more Verrucomicrobia and Gemmatimonadetes in the July samples and Latescibacteria and Verrucomicrobia in the October samples. These results suggest that in comparison with a rice-rice planting system, long-term rapeseed-rice rotation changes the composition and structure of microbial communities, affects soil enzyme activity, supports a more abundant and diverse microbial population, and consequently maintains higher soil quality and fertility.

However, the expansion of green manure is affected by a range of factors, such as soil geophysical properties and human intervention. This paper proposes an approach of spatial modelling to understand the mechanisms that influence green manure expansion and map the future distribution of green manure intercropped in the orchards in the Pinggu District, Beijing, China. We firstly classified the orchards into five grades according to a land productivity evaluation, and then considered two strategies for implementing green manure. Two scenarios were designed to represent the strategies: prioritizing low-productivity orchards to promote green manure intercropping (scenario 1) and prioritizing high-productivity orchards to promote green manure intercropping (scenario 2). The spatial expansion of green manure for 2020 was simulated at a resolution of a 100 x 100 m grid in the CLUE-S (the Conversion of Land Use and its Effects at the Small Region Extent) model. The two strategies led to quite different spatial patterns of green manure, although they were applied to the same areas. As a result, the spatial pattern of green manuring of scenario 1 was more concentrated than that of scenario 2. To summarize, the modelled outcomes identified the driving factors that affect green manure expansion at a grid scale, whereas the implementing strategies directly determined the spatial arrangements of green manuring at a regional scale. Therefore, we argue that the assessment of the driving factors and the prediction of the future distribution of green manuring are crucial for informing an extensive use of green manure.

Pulses for food and nutritional security: The technology perspective	INDIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS AND PLANT BREEDING			English	Article						"Nutritional security; technology; pulses; nutrition perspective; food security"		Pulses though extremely important from a food security and nutrition perspective in India have lagged behind cereals and have been moved increasingly to marginal environments. The persistent demand supply gap in pulses poses several challenges including technological ones that stem from movement of pulses to difficult environments and its place in relation to the competing crops. Technologies in pulses have evolved in line with the needs such as short duration to meet intercropping requirements. Given the long history of technology development that lags behind principal crops marked by near absence of private sector in R&D in pulses, it may be time to rethink and try demand pull systems of research with Advance Marketing Commitments along the lines suggested for vaccines.

However, currently there is no network for organic farmers practicing conservation agriculture, and a lack of knowledge on how organic farmers implement conservation agriculture in practice. Consequently, few technical references are available for organic farmers when they start applying conservation agriculture practices, in particular on controlling weeds without the use of herbicides. The main objectives of this study were: (1) to explore the diversity of conservation agriculture techniques (i.e., reduced tillage, no-tillage and green manures) practiced among European farmers, and (2) to identify farmers' main strategies for implementing conservation agriculture and the agronomic and environmental factors that determine these strategies. Strategies were identified by analyzing survey results on: (1) the type and degree of use of conservation agriculture practices by farmers, and (2) the effects it produces in terms of soil disturbance and soil cover (low, medium and high). We carried out a survey of 159 European organic farmers and collected 125 data sets on management of winter-sown crops. Among the conservation agriculture practices, reduced tillage was used by 89%, no-tillage by 27% and green manure by 74% of the 159 interviewed farmers. Green manures were more frequently used in northern Europe than in the south (below 45 degrees N). Most of the farmers used crop rotations, with a mean duration of 6 years. A wide diversity of conservation agriculture practices were used, with farmers rarely using all three techniques (no-till, reduced till and green manures) within one system. The range of practices was grouped into five strategies ranging from intensive non-inversion tillage without soil cover to very innovative techniques with no-tillage and intercrops. The five strategies for conservation agriculture could be grouped into two larger categories based on weed control approach: (1) intensification of the mechanical work without soil inversion or (2) biological regulation of weeds with cover crops. The diversity of strategies identified in this study shows that organic farmers use innovative approaches to implement conservation agriculture without herbicides. This study's findings will help organic farmers to experiment with innovative practices based on conservation agriculture principles and also benefit conventional farmers who use conservation agriculture practices and would like to reduce or eliminate the use of herbicides.

The major constraint in the success of aerobic rice is high weed infestation. Hence, we have discussed the weed flora, yield losses, herbicide-resistant weeds, need for integrated weed management, and approaches to manage weeds in aerobic rice systems. A review of several studies indicated that 90 weed species were competing with rice under aerobic systems, causing 23-100% reductions in grain yield. Weed control in aerobic rice gets difficult due to shifts in weed flora and herbicide resistance development in weeds. A wide increase in grain yield (15-307%) by implementing different weed control practices elaborates the scope of weed management in aerobic rice. Practices, such as soil solarization, sowing of competitive crop cultivars, stale seedbed preparation, mulch application, correct fertilization, and intercropping, were found to have particular significance for managing weeds in aerobic rice systems. Moreover, hand weeding and mechanical control were more effective when combined with other weed control methods. Herbicides, such as pendimethalin, 2,4-D, penoxsulam, ethoxysulfuron, bispyribac-sodium, triclopyr, imazosulfuron, bensulfuron, pretilachlor, and metsulfuron, were found most effective in aerobic rice systems. Keeping in view the severity of weed infestation in these systems and the evolution of herbicide resistance, reliance on a single control method is out of question. Hence, the approach of integrated weed management is the most appropriate for proper weed management and the subsequent success of rice cultivation using aerobic systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of these two-year field experiments was to study the suitability of different LM options of burr medic (Medicago polymorpha L. var. anglona) for organic cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L.) cultivation in two sites under Mediterranean conditions. In central Italy (Experiment 1) contemporary and delayed (to crop) sowings of LM were compared with a no-cover crop treatment, contrasting two local cauliflower cultivars and a F1 Hybrid. In southern Italy (Experiment 2) the sustainability of systems combining LM (anticipated and contemporary sowing compared with no-cover) and organic fertilisation strategies was assessed. The aboveground biomasses dry weights of cauliflower crop (heads and residues), burr medic and weeds were separately determined. Results suggested that in Experiment 1 the LM was not able to smother weeds establishment and growth, as a consequence of early sowing, while cauliflower yield was reduced. Moreover, the genotypes behaviour was greatly influenced by the LM sowing times. In Experiment 2, irrespective of the agronomic practices applied, climatic conditions notably influenced cauliflower cultivation and also reduced the mean yield. Therefore, the recorded differences between the two experimental sites highlighted the need to tailor the LM strategies to the different environmental conditions.

Where susceptible varieties are grown, farmers control these diseases with routine fungicide applications. To determine an optimum application rate and spray schedule for Orius (R) (tebuconazole 250g/L), we sprayed 10mL and 20mL Orius (R) per 15 L spray water twice at two trifoliate leaf stage and 50% flowering, and three times at the same stages, with an additional application at pod initiation. In farmers' fields, we tested the effect of fungicide sprays, use of resistant variety, intercropping, increased plant spacing and farmyard manure on rust and ALS diseases. Application three times of 20mL Orius (R) per 15 L spray water reduced rust severity scores by 5.7 and 2.4 in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Lowest rust and ALS severities were observed when a resistant variety, fungicide or farmyard manure was used. Pod yield increments due to disease management ranged between 13% and 242%. Prophylactic fungicide application, use of resistant varieties and farmyard manure can be used to reduce disease severity and improve snap bean quality on smallholder farms.

Future air quality regulations could mandate the use of no-till floor management practices in California's Central Valley. We evaluated the combined effects of cover crop type (oats alone or oats grown with legumes) and tillage on soil nutrient availability, vine nutrition, growth, and yield characteristics of Vitis vinifera cv. Merlot grown under regulated deficit irrigation in a commercial vineyard from 2008 to 2010. Five treatments were used: Resident Vegetation (RV) + Till, Oats + Till, Oats/Legumes + Till, Oats + NoTill, and Oats/Legumes + NoTill. No differences in soil nutrient availability were found among the treatments. Of the numerous nutritional constituents analyzed on leaf petioles and blades, only NO3-N-petiole was affected by floor management. At nearly all growth stages among all years, NO3-N-petiole of tilled treatments was twice the no-till treatments. At harvest, yield, mean cluster weight, cluster number per vine, and aboveground cover crop biomass differed among treatments in 2009 and/or 2010 but not in the first year (2008); however, responses were not consistent among treatments within each respective year. Importantly, yields were similar from all four cover crop treatments compared to the typical management (RV + Till), suggesting that use of cover crops and/or no-till practices may be implemented in an irrigated vineyard with little immediate effect on grape productivity in mature vineyards."

Cereals have been reported to inhibit O. crenata parasitism when grown intercropped with susceptible legumes, but the responsible metabolites have not been identified. A number of metabolites have been reported in cereals that have allelopathic properties against weeds, pests, and pathogens. We tested the effect of several allelochemicals identified in cereals on O. crenata seed germination and radicle development. We found that 2-benzoxazolinone, its derivative 6-chloroacetyl-2-benzoxazolinone, and scopoletin significantly inhibited O. crenata seed germination. Benzoxazolinones, L-tryptophan, and coumalic acid caused the stronger inhibition of radicle growth. Also, other metabolites reduced radicle length, this inhibition being dose-dependent. Only scopoletin caused cell necrotic-like darkening in the young radicles. Prospects for their application to parasitic weed management are discussed.

The results indicated that all aqueous leaf extracts of walnut had statistically significant inhibitory effects on the germination of basil seeds and on seedling growth characteristics. Seed germination percentages, the lengths and fresh weights (FWs) of the plumule and the radicle, the FWs and dry weights (DWs) of the shoots and roots, and leaf areas decreased significantly with increasing concentrations of aqueous walnut leaf extract. The DWs of the plumules and radicles were increased by the undiluted walnut leaf extract. Moreover, it was found that the yields of essential oils and total phenolics, and the anti-oxidant activities of basil seedlings increased with increasing concentrations of aqueous walnut leaf extract, whereas the relative water contents of basil leaves, leaf water potentials, as well as the total chlorophyll and carotenoid contents of basil leaves decreased significantly. The highest protein contents and peroxidase (POD) activities were achieved using undiluted or 1:2 (v/v) diluted aqueous walnut leaf extracts, respectively. The results of this study suggest that cultivation of the basil cultivar, 'Genovese' may be appropriate for walnut tree-based intercropping systems, based on the increases in anti-oxidant capacity and the accumulation of secondary metabolites.

In this study, a field trial was conducted to explore the effects of habitat diversification, specifically an intraspecies mixture of genetically distinct cotton lines, on nontarget pests and soil-borne disease. It was hypothesized that the mixture would suppress disease severity and would alter pest and predator abundances. Results confirmed that a row-mixture of 75% insect-resistant cotton and 25% disease-resistant cotton suppressed Fusarium wilt and controlled cotton aphids. However, intercropping at the genotypic level increased mirid bug and sweetpotato whitefly densities in cotton. Moreover, the effect of the mixture on predator abundance ranged from neutral to positive and was highly variable among species and years. Species-specific pest responses to the crop mixture provide new insights for optimally sized and configured refuge construction in the future.

Conservation Agriculture (CA) is currently promoted in the region as a technology to reduce soil degradation, mitigate the effect of droughts and increase crop productivity while reducing production costs. CA relies on the simultaneous use of three practices: (1) minimum or zero-tillage; (2) maintenance of a permanent soil cover and; (3) diversified profitable crop rotation. The most prominent aspect of CA for degraded lands in the semi-arid tropics would be the organic soil cover that impacts on the soil water balance, biological activity, soil organic matter build-up and fertility replenishment. Yet, the organic resources are the most limiting factor in Sahelian agroecosystems due to low biomass productivity and the multiple uses of crop residues, chiefly to feed the livestock. Hence, CA as such may hardly succeed in the current Sahelian context unless alternative sources of biomass are identified. Alternatively, we propose: (1) to gradually rehabilitate the biomass production function of the soil through increased nutrient input and traditional water harvesting measures that have been promoted as soil and water conservation technologies in the Sahel, e.g. zai, in order to restore soil hydrological properties as prerequisite to boosting biomass production; (2) to encourage during this restorative phase the regeneration of native evergreen multipurpose woody shrubs (NEWS) traditionally and deliberately associated to crops and managed the year around and; (3) to shift to classical, less labour intensive CA practices once appropriate levels of soil fertility and water capture are enough to allow increased agroecosystem primary productivity (i.e., an active 'aggradation' phase followed by one of conservation). The CA systems we propose for the Sahelian context are based on intercropping cereal crops and NEWS building on traditional technologies practiced by local farmers. Traditionally. NEWS are allowed to grow in croplands during the dry season; they reduce wind erosion, trap organic residues and capture the Harmattan dust, influence the soil hydraulics and favour soil biological activity under their canopies. They are coppiced at the end of the dry season, leaves and twigs remain as mulch while branches are collected for domestic fuel and other uses. Shoots re-sprouting during the rainy season are suppressed as weeds. Such CA systems have limited competition with livestock due to the poor palatability of the shrub green biomass, which may increase their acceptance by smallholders. Such aggradation-conservation strategy is not free of challenges, as it may imply initial soil disturbance that entail important labour investments, substantially change the structure and management of the cropping system (annual crop-perennial plant), and lead to emerging tradeoffs in the use of resources at different scales. This paper offers a state of the art around NEWS and their integration in relay intercropping CA systems, discusses the above mentioned challenges and the main research needs to address them.

A review	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Review						"Aerobic rice; Arbuscular mycorrhiza; Biofortification; Rhizosphere; Soil; Zinc"	"ORYZA-SATIVA L.; SEMINAL ROOT-SYSTEM; PRECEDING CROP; ORGANIC-ACIDS; LOWLAND RICE; GRAIN-YIELD; WHEAT-GRAIN; SOIL ZINC; COMPENSATORY INCREASES; ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAS"	Zinc (Zn) deficiency is a widely occurring constraint for rice production and for human nutrition. Scarcity of water is leading to a shift from flooded to aerobic rice production, which can have an impact on Zn deficiency in rice. Zinc bioavailability is a function of both soil and plant factors that can be altered by water management, particularly in relation to conditions in the rhizosphere. Biogeochemical modeling based on bulk soil conditions failed to predict the effect of water management on Zn bioavailability, but revealed that dissolved organic anions, pH, and redox conditions were major determinants. Rhizosphere sampling is needed to understand the difference in Zn mobilization and uptake between flooded and aerobic cultivation systems. Zinc bioavailability is not only affected by changes in the chemical properties of the soils, but also by biological processes such as mycorrhizal inoculation and root release of organic compounds into rhizosphere. Phytosiderophores and organic acids are two classes of Zn chelators secreted from roots that have been linked to the release of Zn from soil-bound forms and its subsequent uptake by plants. A shift to aerobic condition provides a favorable environment for activity of mycorrhizal fungi and enhanced mycorrhizal inoculation under aerobic conditions has been shown to increase plant Zn uptake. Aerobic rice genotypes with varying tolerance to Zn deficiency display a trade-off between mycorrhizal Zn responsiveness and root exudation of Zn chelator in the rhizosphere, which is probably due to a competition for carbon. Potential agronomic management practices in aerobic rice production systems are discussed, with an emphasis on their roles in improving bioavailability of Zn. Addition of Zn fertilizers by soil or foliar application have been shown to increase Zn concentration in cereal grains but the extent of the increase differs among crop species. The shift from flooded to aerobic condition can cause significant N transformations, which may consequently affect Zn mobilization and uptake. An appropriate N management strategy, including an effective combination of source, rate, application method, and timing, should consider the effects on soil pH. Application of P fertilizer should be done with careful consideration to the effect on Zn uptake. A reasonable cropping system (intercropping and crop rotation) could prevent Zn deficiency and offer an effective and sustainable pathway to Zn biofortification. Keeping these points in mind, this review describes our current knowledge of Zn bioavailability as affected by changes in soil-plant interactions caused by the transition from flooded to aerobic rice cultivation.

However, adoption is often constrained by poor weed suppression compared to nonlegume cover crops. In field experiments conducted in organic vegetable cropping systems in north-central New York, two primary hypotheses were tested: (1) mixtures of legume cover crops (cowpea and soybean) with grasses (sorghum-sudangrass and Japanese millet) reduce weed seed production and increase cover crop productivity relative to legume monocultures and (2) higher soil fertility shifts the competitive outcome in favor of weeds and nonlegume cover crops. Cover crops were grown either alone or in grass-legume combinations with or without composted chicken manure. Under hot, dry conditions in 2005, cowpea and soybean cover crops were severely suppressed by weeds in monoculture and by sorghum-sudangrass in mixtures, resulting in low legume biomass, poor nodulation, and high levels of Powell amaranth seed production (> 25,000 seeds m(-2)). Under more typical temperature and rainfall conditions in 2006, cowpea mixtures with Japanese millet stimulated cowpea biomass production and nodulation compared to monoculture, but soybeans were suppressed in mixtures with both grasses. Composted chicken manure shifted competition in favor of weeds at the expense of cowpea (2005), stimulated weed and grass biomass production (2006), and suppressed nodulation of soybean (2006). In a complementary on-farm trial, cowpea mixtures with sorghum-sudangrass suppressed weed biomass by 99%; however, both common purslane and hairy galinsoga produced sufficient seeds (600 seeds m(-2)) to replenish the existing weed seedbank. Results suggest that (1) mixtures of cowpeas with grasses can improve nodulation, lower seed costs, and reduce the risk of weed seed production; (2) soybean is not compatible with grasses in mixture; and (3) future costs of weed seed production must be considered when determining optimal cover crop choices."

This can benefit not only the legumes themselves but also any intercropped or subsequent crops, thus reducing or removing the need to apply N fertilizers. Improved quantification of legume biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) will provide better guidance for farmers on managing N to optimise productivity and reduce harmful losses to the environment. There are many techniques available for the direct quantitative measurement of legume BNF in the field and in controlled environments. However, these are time-consuming and therefore expensive, and generate data relevant only to the time and place of measurement. Alternatively, legume BNF can be estimated by either empirical models or dynamic mechanistic simulation models. Comparatively, simulation by a dynamic model is preferable for quantifying legume BNF, because of its capability to simulate the response of N fixation to a wide range of environmental variables and legume growth status. Currently there is no published review of the approaches used to simulate, rather than measure, legume BNF. This review of peer-reviewed literature shows that most simulation models estimate the N fixation rate from a pre-defined potential N fixation rate, adjusted by the response functions of soil temperature, soil/plant water status, soil/plant N concentration, plant carbon (C) supply and crop growth stage. Here, we highlight and compare the methods used to estimate the potential N fixation rate, and the response functions to simulate legume BNF, in nine widely-cited models over the last 30 years.We then assess their relative strengths in simulating legume BNF with varying biotic and abiotic factors, and identify the discrepancies between experimental findings and simulations. After this comparison, we identify the areas where there is the potential to improve legume BNF simulation in the future. These include; (1) consideration of photosynthetic C supply, (2) refining the various effects of soil mineral N concentration, (3) characterization and incorporation of excess soil water stress and other factors into models, and (4) incorporation of the effects of grazing, coexistence and competition with intercrops and weeds into models to improve their practical relevance to sustainable agricultural systems. This review clarifies, for the first time, the current progress in legume BNF quantification in simulation models, and provides guidance for their further development, combining fundamental experimental and modelling work."

Effect of cover crops and mulches on weed control and nitrogen fertilization in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.)	CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						"Weed suppression; Soil cover; Crop residues; Integrated weed management; Nitrogen supply; Tomato yield"	"INTERCROPPING DESIGN; GREEN MANURE; HAIRY VETCH; SOIL; MANAGEMENT; GROWTH; TILLAGE; CLOVER; SUPPRESSION; YIELD"	Cover crops and mulches are a suitable choice for sustainable agriculture because they improve weed control and crop performance. The aim of this research was to investigate weed control and nitrogen supply by using different winter cover crop species which were converted into mulches in spring. We carried out a 2-year field experiment where a tomato crop was transplanted into four different types of mulches coming from winter cover crops [hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.), subclover (Trifolium subterraneum L), oat (Avena sativa L), and a mixture of hairy vetch/oat)] and in conventional treatment (tilled soil without mulch). The mixture of hairy vetch/oat cover crop produced the highest aboveground biomass (7.9 t ha(-1) of DM), while the hairy vetch accumulated the highest N in the aboveground biomass (258 kg N ha(-1)). The oat cover crop was the most effective cover crop for suppressing weeds (on average 93% of weed aboveground biomass compared to other cover crops). After mowing the cover crop aboveground biomass was placed in strips as dead mulch into which the tomato was transplanted in paired rows. Weed density and total weed aboveground biomass were assessed at 15 and 30 days after tomato transplanting to evaluate the effect of mulches on weed control. All mulches suppressed weeds in density and aboveground biomass compared to the conventional system (on average 80% and 35%, respectively). The oat was the best mulch for weed control but also had a negative effect on the marketable tomato yield (-15% compared to the conventional treatment). Amaranthus retroflexus L and Chenopodium album L were typical weeds associated with the conventional treatment while a more heterogeneous weed composition was found in mulched tomato. Legume mulches, in particular hairy vetch, gave the best marketable tomato yield 28% higher than the conventional system both with and without nitrogen fertilization. This research shows that winter cover crops converted into dead mulch in spring could be used successfully in integrated weed management programs to reduce weed infestation in tomato crops.

However, the benefit of these innovations depends on the farming context. Here we present the ad hoc adaptation of the crop model SIMBA and a method to evaluate 16 innovations in six types of farms previously selected through a typology of the banana farming systems in Guadeloupe. The innovations include regulation of pesticide use, rotations and fallows, intercropping, conditional application of pesticides, resistant cultivars, and integrated systems. Our results show that, for a given innovation, the yield and pesticide reduction vary widely with different farm types. We show that environmentally friendly innovations often cause a greater decrease in yield in more productive farm types. Nevertheless, despite an apparent trade-off between yield and pesticide use, some innovations address both production and environmental issues, e.g., rotation with fallows improved with cover crops, regular fallows, and rotations with pineapples for the most intensive farm types. Our modelling study confirms the importance of innovation-farm type interactions and the usefulness of models for assessing large numbers of technological innovations among a wide range of biophysical and technical contexts.

Integrated crop-livestock systems in the southeastern USA	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	"Article; Proceedings Paper"	Symposium on Integrated Crop-Livestock Systems for Profit and Sustainability	NOV 08, 2005	Salt Lake City, UT	ASA,CSSA,SSSA			"SOUTHERN PIEDMONT USA; NO-TILL; BERMUDAGRASS MANAGEMENT; FORAGE PRODUCTION; GRAZING WHEAT; GRAIN-YIELD; SOIL; CORN; NITROGEN; BAHIAGRASS"	Opportunities to integrate crops and livestock are abundant throughout the southeastern USA due to a mild climate and a rich natural resource base that can produce different crops throughout the year. Although not currently common, integration of forage and grazing animals with cropping systems could benefit both production and environmental goals. This report summarizes research from some of the key components that could produce viable integrated crop-livestock production systems: sod-based crop rotation, cover cropping, intercropping, and conservation tillage. Sod-based crop rotations have been effective in breaking pest cycles and restoring soil organic matter, which critically controls a wide diversity of key soil and plant properties and processes. Cover cropping by itself has many agronomic benefits, but its adoption appears to be limited, because of cost without immediate economic benefit. Grazing of cover crops could provide an immediate economic benefit to producers, especially with the development of conservation tillage technologies to avoid deterioration of soil and water quality. The potential for advancement of integrated crop-livestock systems is exemplified in a few current research projects in the Coastal Plain and Piedmont regions. With greater integration of crops and livestock, new management guidelines and experiences will be needed, but the quantity and quality of production and economic return could increase, while at the same time placing less degrading pressure on soil and water resources.

A critical analysis of challenges and opportunities for soil fertility restoration in Sudano-Sahelian West Africa	NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS			English	Review						"fertilizers; legumes; modelling; organic amendments; soil fertility management; West Africa"	"ACID SANDY SOIL; FARMERS MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES; MONITORING NUTRIENT FLOWS; FARMING SYSTEMS NUTMON; PEARL-MILLET GROWTH; CROP RESIDUES; LAND-USE; WIND EROSION; LONG-TERM; CHEMICAL-PROPERTIES"	Since the 1970s, research throughout West Africa showed that low soil organic matter and limited availability of plant nutrients, in particular phosphorus and nitrogen, are major bottlenecks to agricultural productivity, which is further hampered by substantial topsoil losses through wind and water erosion. A few widely recognized publications pointing to massive nutrient mining of the existing crop-livestock production systems triggered numerous studies on a wide array of management strategies and policies suited to improve soil fertility. Throughout Sudano-Sahelian West Africa, the application of crop residue mulch, animal manure, rockphosphates and soluble mineral fertilizers have been shown to enhance crop yields, whereby yield increases varied with the agro-ecological setting and the rates of amendments applied. In more humid areas of Western Africa, the intercropping of cereals with herbaceous or ligneous leguminous species, the installation of fodder banks for increased livestock and manure production, and composting of organic material also proved beneficial to crop production. However, there is evidence that the low adoption of improved management strategies and the lack of long-term investments in soil fertility can be ascribed to low product prices for agricultural commodities, immediate cash needs, risk aversion and labour shortage of small-scale farmers across the region. The wealth of knowledge gathered during several decades of on-station and on-farm experimentation calls for an integration of these data into a database to serve as input variables for models geared towards ex-ante assessment of the suitability of technologies and policies at the scale of farms, communities and regions. Several modelling approaches exist that can be exploited in this sense. Yet, they have to be improved in their ability to account for agro-ecological and socio-economic differences at various geographical scales and for residual effects of management options, thereby allowing scenario analysis and guiding further fundamental and participatory research, extension and political counselling.

The research results during the last 2 decades have clearly established that these adverse impacts of green revolution technologies may be mitigated through an appropriate choice of alternative crops and cropping systems, which are efficient user of resource base (land, water, light and energy), economically more remunerative and environment-friendly. An adoption of well-designed situation-specific alternative cropping systems along with appropriate method of cultivation could minimize the occurrence or intensity of diseases and insect pests, including weeds, considerably. These are also helpful in conservation of the soil resource, improvement of soil health and protection of the environment by minimizing nitrate leaching, besides improving nutrient and water-use efficiencies. System-based integrated nutrient management, integrated pest management and resource conservation technologies such as, zero tillage, furrow-irrigated raised bed, and ridge or bed planting are some of the new technologies deserving immediate focus. The suggested strategies of immediate concern are complementary intensive intercropping systems under limited water availability, quantification of on-farm impacts of diversification options on productivity, stability, profitability, soil health, water and nutrient-use productivity development of sustainable production models using computer software, organic fanning systems, focus on system-based integrated resource management, development of site-specific precision input management and resource-conservation technologies, appropriate policies for multi-disciplinary research through inter-institutional and or inter-organizational collaborative programmes, and development of appropriate decision-support systems for diversification options and resource-use optimization under variable scenarios.

J	Hossain, MA				Hossain, MA			Agronomic practises for weed control in turmeric (Curcuma longa L.)	WEED BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Review						"planting depth; planting pattern; planting space; planting time; seed size; turmeric yield; weed interference"	"WHEAT SEED SIZE; SPRING WHEAT; CROP DENSITY; YIELD; ROW; HERBICIDES; REMOVAL; DEPTH; SOIL"	"Weeds are the main problem with turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) cultivation where herbicides are not allowed. This is because herbicides cause water contamination, air pollution, soil microorganism hazards, health hazards, and food risks. Considering turmeric's medicinal value and the environmental problems caused by herbicides, various agronomic practises have been evaluated for non-chemical weed control in turmeric. One additional weeding is required before turmeric emergence and weed infestation is much higher when turmeric is planted in February and March, as compared to April, May or June planting. A similarly higher yield of turmeric is achieved when it is planted in February, March, and April, compared to late plantings. Weed emergence and interference are not affected by planting depth, seed size, planting pattern, planting space, ridge spacing, and the row number of turmeric until 60 days after planting. This is because turmeric cannot develop a canopy structure until then. Thereafter, weed infestation reduces similarly and significantly when turmeric is planted at depths of 8,12, and 16 cm, compared to shallower depths. The yield of turmeric at these depths is statistically the same, but the yield for the 16 cm depth is difficult to harvest and it tends to decrease. Turmeric grown from seed rhizomes (daughter rhizomes) weighing 30-40 g reduces weed infestation significantly and obtains a significantly higher yield compared to smaller seeds. The mother rhizome also can suppress weed infestation and increase the yield markedly. Around 9% weed control and 11% higher yield are achieved by planting turmeric in a triangular pattern compared to a quadrate pattern. The lowest weed infestation is found in turmeric grown in a 20 or 30 cm triangular pattern and the highest yield is obtained with the 30 cm triangular pattern. Turmeric gown on two-row ridges spaced 75 cm apart shows excellent weed control efficiency and obtains the highest yield. This review concludes that turmeric seed rhizomes of 30-40 g and/or the mother rhizome could be planted in a 30 cm triangular pattern at the depth of 8-12 cm on two-row ridges spaced 75-100 cm apart during March to April in order to reduce weed interference and obtain a higher yield. Mulching also suppresses weed growth and improves the yield. The above agronomic practises could not control weeds completely; biological weed management practises could be integrated in turmeric fields using rabbits, goats, sheep, ducks, cover crops or intercrops."

An indeterminate cultivar was examined from twenty-seven treatments consisting of all possible combinations of three levels of photosynthetic irradiance, 100, 250 and 400 mumol m(-2) s(-1), applied during three phenological phases. Acclimation characteristics to reduced irradiance included lower chlorophyll a/b ratio, reduced stomatal density, increased specific leaf area and leaf area ratio and increased shoot-root ratio. Susceptibility of the phases varied when comparisons were made based on entire phases and a magnitude that considered timing and light interception. Number of pods per plant, the predominant yield component, responded to irradiance level during all phases but most during flowering. For number of seeds per pod the only relevant phase was seed filling while seed weight responded during flowering and seed filling. A significant interaction between the irradiance levels of phases was observed for pod number.

In order to assess the effects of land use and landscape position on soil nutrients consisting of soil organic matter (SOM), total N (TN), total P (TP), available N (AN) and available P (AP), soil samples were collected in August and October 1998 and July 1999 from three transects in a small catchment on the loess plateau, China. The three transects consisted of typical land use structure from the top to foot of hillslope in the study area: fallow land - cropland - woodland - orchard (Tl), fallow land - shrub land - fallow land - cropland - woodland - orchard (T2) and intercropping land - woodland (T3). Significant differences among land uses were found for SOM, TN and AN. Woodland, shrub land and grassland had the higher levels for them compared to fallow land and cropland. Use of soil deterioration index showed that soils deteriorated moderately ( - 17.05%) under orchard and seriously (ranging from -29.91% to -20.32%) under fallow land, cropland and intercropping land, while soils had no deterioration ( - 0.74%) under shrubland and ( - 0.69%) grassland. This study indicated that the cultivated hilly lands must be abandoned before a critical minimum SOM of 0.492%. Soil nutrient responses to landscape positions were variable depending on transect and the location of land use types. The highest levels in SOM, TN and AN were observed at middle slope position on T1, while they occurred at foot slope position on T3. However, an increasing trend from upper slope to foot slope for five nutrients were found on T2. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

J	Bath, B				Bath, B			Nitrogen mineralization and uptake in leek after incorporation of red clover strips at different times during the growing period	BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE & HORTICULTURE			English	Article							"BRUSSELS-SPROUTS; SOIL-NITROGEN; LIVING MULCH; CATCH CROPS; N-15; GROWTH; SYSTEM; LOSSES; WHEAT; YIELD"	Green manure crops are an important N-source in organic farming systems with field vegetables. Difficulties in controlling N-mineralization from green manure crops and differences in N-uptake pattern of succeeding crops result in large variations in crop N-uptake and increase the potential risk of N-losses. In this work, time of incorporation of red clover was examined as a means to improve the availability of mineralized N to reek. Strips of red clover, left between the rows of leek. were incorporated at planting, or 2 or 4 weeks after planting. The difference in N-uptake was small between treatments with incorporation of red clover strips between rows at planting and 2 weeks after planting. With the latest time of incorporation the N-uptake was lower. The inter-row clover strips assimilated and transferred inherent soil-N as well as N mineralized from red clover incorporated in the leek rows. This kept mineral-N values at a lour level until time of incorporation. The effect was especially pronounced and prolonged in treatments with the latest time of incorporation and contributed to the low growth rate in this treatment. Low growth rate made it difficult for the leek crop to exploit N mineralized between rows and thereby decreased N-uptake and increased the leaching risk after harvest. Results from this experiment show that intercropping, beyond the crop establishment phase, can not be recommended. However, if other benefits such as decreased pressure from weeds and pests. and improved soil structure are taken into account, intercropping may prove to be economically justifiable.

Organic soil amendments and crop diversification are basic components of LEI systems. Weed scientists can improve the use of these practices for weed management by improving knowledge of four relevant ecological mechanisms. First, multispecies crop rotations, intercrops and cover crops may reduce opportunities for weed growth and regeneration through resource competition and niche disruption. Secondly, weed species appear to be more susceptible to phytotoxic effects of crop residues and other organic soil amendments than crop species, possibly because of differences in seed mass. Thirdly, delayed patterns of N availability in LEI systems may favour large-seeded crops over small-seeded weeds. Finally, additions of organic materials can change the incidence and severity of soil-borne diseases affecting weeds and crops. Our research on LEI sweetcorn and potato production systems in central and northern Maine (USA) suggests that these mechanisms can reduce weed density and growth while maintaining crop yields. Low-external-input farming systems will advance most quickly through the application of interdisciplinary research focused on these and other ecological mechanisms.

Field carabids are species rich and abundant in arable sites, but are affected by intensive agricultural cultivation. For sampling, fenced pitfall trapping or pitfall trapping is recommended according to the type of study. Many of the assumed beneficial pest control activities of carabids are still based on laboratory feeding records. In the field, carabids have been demonstrated to reduce cereal and sugar beet aphid populations in their early colonization phase, mainly by foraging on aphids that have fallen from the vegetation. Egg predation on Dipteran eggs, e.g. the cabbage root fly, has been overestimated in earlier literature. Scattered data indicate carabidforaging on certain coleopteran pest larvae. In North America, some evidence has been found for control of pest lepidopterans. Larger carabids, e.g. Abax parallelepipedus, can effectively control slugs in greenhouses. Because of their spermophagous feeding habits, certain species of Harpalus and Amara could have some potential for biological weed control. As a result of their sensitive reaction to anthropogenic changes in habitat quality, carabids are considered of bioindicative value for cultivation impacts. Carabids seem to be negatively affected by deep ploughing and enhanced by reduced tillage systems. No negative effects have been found for mechanical weed control and flaming. Carabid recruitment is enhanced by proper organic fertilization and green manuring. Intensive nitrogen amendment might indirectly affect carabids by altering crop density and microclimate. Field carabid assemblages are not bound to a certain crop type, but shift in dominance according to the crop-specific rhythmicity of cultivation measures and changes in crop phenology and microclimate. Crop rotation effects could also be influenced by held-size dependent recolonization capability of carabids. They are enhanced by crop diversification in terms of monocrop heterogeneity and weediness as well as by intercropping and the presence of field boundaries, although corresponding increases in their pest reduction efficacy have not yet been evidenced.

Expansion of dry bean production into dryland areas in western Canada requires re-evaluation of the best growth habit. The objective of this study was to compare determinate and indeterminate pinto bean cultivars for seed yield and other agronomic traits under a soil moisture gradient. Six pinto bean cultivars, three determinate and three indeterminate, were grown under an available soil moisture gradient in Saskatoon SK, Canada at one environment in 1993 and at two environments in 1994. An increase in available soil moisture, induced by growing rows of pinto bean plants at increasing distances from a spring-seeded winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) strip, increased number of pods per plant, plant height, seed weight, seed yield and seed nitrogen concentration for both determinate and indeterminate cultivars of pinto bean. Indeterminate cultivars, however, were taller and higher yielding than determinate cultivars at every level of soil moisture under these dryland conditions.

Web-building spiders are directly linked to the configuration of the vegetation because of specific web attachment requirements. Both correlative and experimental data support a tight relationship between spider density and habitat structure. Most of the available data show that agricultural practices which enhance the structural complexity of the environment (such as intercropping, mulching, and conservation tillage practices) enhance the density and diversity of the spider community. The key question regarding spiders in agroecosystems is, of course, whether they are in any way suppressing the activity of herbivores. Some studies uncovered a strong link between habitat complexity, spider abundance and plant productivity; but others have not, and the mechanisms by which spiders could exert a top-down effect are not clear. More investigation into the specifics of how habitat structure influences the predator-prey interactions in agroecosystems is needed in order to truly understand and manage agricultural production in a responsible manner."

A 2-yr study was conducted to evaluate the effects of cropping system [monocrop corn (Zea mays L.) and corn intercropped with annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.)] on dry matter (DM) production and distribution and on N uptake and allocation in the plants during the development of corn. Each of these corn systems was produced on a fine sandy loam (Typic Humaquept), using an application of 270 kg N ha(-1) in each spring. Zero N (control) and conventional N rate (180 kg N ha(-1)) treatments were included for monocropped corn with conventional drainage. Plant tissues of all treatments were sampled at six-leaf, tasseling, and mid-grain filling stages, and after physiological maturity. In both years, DM production and N uptake of intercropped corn were lower than, or not different from, the monocropped corn (depending on growth stage). The total N uptake and DM production of the intercropping system (corn + ryegrass + weeds) were greater than those of the monocrop system. Application of 270 kg N ha(-1) resulted in 20% less N recovery than 180 kg N ha(-1) with monocropped corn production using free drainage. Both the corn-ryegrass intercropping system and applied N rates altered the allocation of DM and N among different parts of the corn plants. The ryegrass and weeds were not able to take up enough of the extra N after the high N rate was applied for two consecutive years. The effect of precipitation on annual ryegrass growth was an important factor in N uptake by the intercropping system.

J	Martin, CC				Martin, CC			Weed control in tropical ley farming systems: A review	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	"Article; Proceedings Paper"	Workshop on Conservation Farming for the Semi-Arid Tropics	JUL 18-20, 1995	KATHERINE, AUSTRALIA	Austr Inst Agr Sci, No Territory Zone,Doug Peake Mem Trust			"COMPETITION; MANAGEMENT; TILLAGE; GERMINATION; DYNAMICS; PASTURES"	"The first sustained effort to develop a ley farming system (a pasture legume rotated with a grain crop) for the Australian semi-arid tropics began in the late 1970s at Katherine, Northern Territory, where various strategies were identified and implemented. It was soon discovered that a main constraint to success was the invasion of the legume ley by grass weeds. This occurred despite the replacement of Townsville style (Stylosanthes humilis), which provided the base for the early work, with more competitive legumes such as Verano (Stylosanthes hamata) and Centurion centro (Centrosema pascuorum). Early weed control work focused on the use of chemicals, but later competition and population dynamics were studied in S. humilis pastures. The ley farming system comprised a number of essential elements, each of which offered opportunities for weed control. First, a legume ley was rotated with grain crops. Past work concentrated on legume leys, but nitrogen (N)-fertilised grass leys may be successful if the N was economically supplied. Grasses can effectively suppress weeds. Rotation of herbicides is possible. Sicklepod (Senna obtusifolia) can be controlled with atrazine in the sorghum phase, and emergent Sida spp. can be controlled in the pasture phase using a herbicide roller. Second, cattle graze the legume ley and crop residues in the dry season. Cattle can be used to suppress grass weeds in the wet season. The major use of the legume ley, however, was to provide high quality food in the dry season when there was little other available food. Future research should investigate the economics of balancing the need for grass weed control with food provision in the dry season. Third, crops sown directly into a ley killed with a knockdown herbicide. Although the need for improved soil surface management was. recognised early, development of reduced tillage was delayed until the availability of glyphosate. Initial work concentrated on improving plant establishment under mulch. Recent work has shown that mulches can effectively control weeds in crops without the use of herbicides; best weed control occurred when glyphosate was applied as a single application at sowing. Fourth, ley regenerated as an intercrop in the grain crop. There is no doubt that the presence of an intercrop reduces the yield of the grain crop. Future research should investigate the economics and risks associated with intercrop-induced changes in yield and herbicide-use patterns. The extreme climate and sandy soils pose problems for herbicide use. There is marked seasonal variation in effectiveness of pre-emergence herbicides, ranging from zero to marked crop phytotoxicity. The effectiveness of knockdown herbicides is reduced by stressed target plants and rain soon after spraying. Mulch dynamics, grazing, competition and interference, and herbicide interactions with target plants and the environment, were identified as key features requiring attention in a ley farming system to achieve practical weed management."

Enhanced biological diversity potentially offers agricultural producers a means of reducing the cost of their production. Conservation of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes may be greatly enhanced by the adoption of certain crop management practices, such as reduced pesticide usage or measures to prevent soil erosion. Still, the vast monocultures comprising the crop area in many Canadian agricultural landscapes are often of limited conservation value, thus the inclusion of appropriate wildlife habitat in and around arable lands is a fundamental prerequisite for the integration of wild species within agricultural landscapes. This review of current literature considers the potential for non-crop areas within agricultural landscapes to be reservoirs of agronomically beneficial organisms including plants, invertebrates, and vertebrate species. Non-crop habitats adjacent to crop land have been identified as significant for the maintenance of plant species diversify, for the conservation of beneficial pollinating and predatory insects, and as essential habitat for birds. A key component for enhancement of biodiversity is the reintroduction of landscape heterogeneity by (1) protection and enhancement of key non-crop areas, (2) smaller fields and farms, and (3) a greater mixture of crops, through rotation, intercropping and regional diversification. The benefits of increased biodiversity within arable lands are reviewed for various species groups. In the Canadian. context, any serious attempt to derive significant agronomic benefit from increased biodiversity will require considerable changes in the agricultural programs and policies which shape mainstream industrialized agriculture. The problems of crop depredation by vertebrate species, weed and insect competition, which still represent significant impediments to the creation and proper management of wildlife habitat, are also discussed.

They are interdependent and contribute to stability in plant communities. Soils typically contain several species of VAM fungi, all of which may colonize the roots of most crop plants. However, the fungi may differ in their ability to elicit specific host-plant or host-soil responses, suggesting that a combination of fungi is needed to function as an adequate plant-,soil interface. Since in agricultural ecosystems the introduction of exotic weeds and crops, cultivation, and chemicals alter the composition and vitality of the VAM mycoflora, management practices enhancing the combined effects of surviving and introduced VAM fungi must be developed. Benefits of introduction depend on the potential of VAM fungi to exploit soil resources and to tolerate the natural and culturally imposed conditions of a host soil, and on their compatibility with specific host plants in forming associations of improved productivity. Fungi must therefore be selected to satisfy the requirements of the agricultural situations whose problems they are intended to alleviate. In addition to applications in plant nutrition, VAM fungi are involved in crop rotation, intercrops, grazing, and weed and pest control. Perhaps the greatest potential for the utilization of VAM fungi in sustainable plant production systems lies in the improvement of soil stability and erosion control.

In the latter 2 regions, pastoral industries dominate and crop production is curtailed by regular and severe soil waterlogging, except for limited areas of lower rainfall. Subsurface drainage can eliminate waterlogging, but is feasible only for the Western District where subsoils are sufficiently stable. The other regions all have a long history of soil degradation due to cropping practices, but these effects can now be minimised with the use of direct drilling and stubble retention cropping methods. A vigorous pasture ley phase is still considered necessary to maintain nitrogen levels and to restore soil structure to adequate levels for sustainable farming. Future productivity improvements will require increased root growth in the subsoils. Deep ripping, 'slotting' of gypsum, and crop species capable of opening up subsoils are techniques which may hold promise in this regard. The inclusion of lucerne, a perennial species, in annual pastures and intercropping at intervals is a technique being pioneered in north-central and western Victoria and may provide the best opportunity to crop duplex soils successfully without associated land degradation.

The objective of this mechanistic greenhouse study was to determine the effect of cover crop community diversity and soil fertility on nitrogenase activity and nodule biomass of cowpea. Cover crops were grown for 42-53days, aboveground biomass was harvested, and nitrogenase activity was estimated with the acetylene reduction assay. Roots were then excavated to determine nodule and root biomass. Nitrogenase activity and nodule biomass per plant were greatest in cowpea monoculture and reduced by 71-98 percent in four-species mixtures. Reduced capacity for N-2 fixation was partially driven by lower cowpea biomass in mixtures. The ratio of root nodule / shoot biomass increased by 81-297 percent in low-fertility relative to high-fertility soils, which contributed to increased nitrogenase activity. Results suggest cowpea monocultures in low-fertility soils have the greatest potential for N-2 fixation.

However, farmers seldom use crop mixtures, due to a combination of obstacles characterizing a sociotechnical lock-in. The dominant system remains the cultivation of pure crops, with acknowledged environmental impacts, but some innovative farmers are experimenting crop mixtures. This study aimed to identify and analyze the crop mixtures grown by these farmers, with a view to creating cognitive resources to help other farmers to adopt and adapt this practice to their own context. The on-farm innovative practices tracking method was implemented in Center-West and Southwest France. We surveyed 47 farmers who were already growing crop mixtures. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to identify the crop mixtures grown by these farmers, the objectives targeted with these mixtures, the crop management applied, and the farmers' satisfaction criteria. In total, 77 combinations involving 29 different species were found. Most of the mixtures included grain or forage legumes. We distinguished seven types of crop mixtures, based on their seasonal or temporal organization, and the target outlets for the mixtures. Each type of crop mixture was associated with a particular set of farmer's objectives. Crop management practices for mixtures of similar species sometimes differed considerably between farmers. An analysis of the agronomic rationale of farmers revealed consistency between technical choices, farmer's objectives and farm context. Based on an agronomic cross-analysis of these on-farm innovative practices, we generated actionable knowledge and cognitive resources to support farmers and agricultural extension workers wishing to redesign their cropping systems to make them more sustainable.

In particular, pulses are crops that can help both agriculture and the food industry become more ecological, as they reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help reduce animal-based consumption. Today, however, the development of these crops in Europe has been hindered due to lock-in, since major crops have been co-developed to a greater extent in farming and food systems. After briefly reviewing the major mechanisms that lead to this lock-in, this article adopts a co-evolution framework to address the interconnected transition of agriculture and food systems. We explore how current societal trends in the agrifood system offer new opportunities for pulses, and how simultaneous changes both in production and consumption can facilitate this dual transition. Drawing on insights from the literature and interviews with stakeholders in France-taken here as examples-we argue that to develop pulses, strong support is required from public institutions to coordinate and guide the multiple actors involved in the same direction.

J	"Ding, HY; Ali, A; Cheng, ZH"				"Ding, Haiyan; Ali, Ahmad; Cheng, Zhihui"			Dynamics of a Soil Fungal Community in a Three-Year Green Garlic/Cucumber Crop Rotation System in Northwest China	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						"Allium sativum; Cucumis sativus; sustainable agriculture; fungal diversity"	"MICROBIAL COMMUNITY; INTERCROPPING SYSTEM; BACTERIAL COMMUNITY; RHIZOSPHERE SOIL; CUCUMIS-SATIVUS; SOYBEAN YIELDS; CINNAMIC ACID; COVER CROPS; DIVERSITY; MICROORGANISMS"	A decreased soil biological environment in terms of an unstable microbial population and diversity index is primarily caused by intensive continuous cropping systems. In this study, a crop rotation system was established to evaluate the soil fungal diversity using a pyrosequencing-based analysis during three successive growing seasons (2013, 2014, and 2015) under a field pot investigation. We found that overall green garlic/cucumber rotational effects increased cucumber productivity under these growing practices. Analysis of fungal communities in rhizosphere soils by high-throughput pyrosequencing showed that the estimated treatment effects were more obvious during the three-year trials, and OTU richness was much higher than the control in cucumber-planted soils. The relative frequencies of fungal diversity showed variable responses before and after rotation practices, and mainly alpha-diversity of fungi increased in garlic planted soil and again decreased after cucumber planted soil in each year. The phylogenetic classification illustrated that the fungal communities were dominated by the taxa Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, Glomeromycota, and Zygomycota across all samples. Particularly, the relative abundance of the taxon Ascomycota was largely and predominantly enriched with the increasing number of garlic bulbs during the three years. Moreover, the majority of abundant taxa positively correlated with available P and K contents, while being highly negatively correlated with soil pH, EC, and SOC. These results indicate that garlic-cucumber-based crop rotations induce fungal richness and diversity and promote the sustainability of agricultural ecosystems, thus enhancing crop growth and production.

WILCZEK; WESTERN KENYA; SRI-LANKA; MEXICAN SUNFLOWER; ORGANIC-ACIDS; ALUMINUM; BUCKWHEAT; CALCIUM"	Oxalate has been associated with Al tolerance in higher plants. We found higher concentrations of free oxalate and Al in roots as compared to leaves of Tithonia diversifolia sampled from either a cultivated field or a native undisturbed soil in an ecological reserve located in the coastal range in northern Venezuela. Both soils showed similar concentrations of Ca, Mn and Ni whereas the concentrations of Al, Fe, Cu and Zn of the cultivated field were higher than those of the native soil. Plants from the cultivated field had leaves with higher concentrations of Al, Ca, Fe, and P than those from the native soil. The same was observed in roots, but only for Fe and P. The highest values of free oxalate, measured by ion chromatography, were found in plants growing on native soil. In leaves, higher levels of free oxalate were correlated with lower total Ca concentrations. Roots of young plants submersed in Al containing nutrient solutions were induced to exudate oxalate, in proportion to the Al concentration, and exudation increased over a period of 8 days in plants maintained in solutions with 9 and 90 mmol Al L-1. We conclude that oxalate is acting in T diversifolia as an Al chelator, thus preventing the toxic effect of this metal.

Leaf area index (L) increased with rise of temperature, and after 85 d was about 10-fold larger at 31-degrees-C than 19-degrees-C. Over most of the range of temperature, both L and fractional interception of solar radiation (f) were functions of thermal time accumulated from sowing (above a base of 10-degrees-C). In this respect, they were tightly coupled to developmental rate at the main apex. In one experiment, only 38% of seeds emerged at 22-degrees-C and 21% at 19-degrees-C, compared with more than 70% at 25-degrees-C and 31-degrees-C, but the low population density was compensated by faster leaf expansion by each plant (at 22-degrees-C only) and a greater fraction of solar radiation intercepted by unit leaf area. The amount of solar radiation intercepted by stands increased with rise in temperature, but the greatest differences between treatments occurred before the canopies achieved complete ground cover (i.e. f > 0.9) and the relative effect of a rise in temperature diminished the longer the duration of growth. The dry matter produced for unit solar radiation intercepted was not strongly affected by temperature between 22-degrees-C and 31-degrees-C. where the mean was 2.1 g MJ-1; the value at 19-degrees-C was uncertain since the stands were sparse throughout the experiment. After 85 d, the stand at 31-degrees-C had produced eight times the dry matter of that at 19-degrees-C-a difference caused mainly by the effect of temperature on the rates of development and expansion."
