The first experiment was based on a sand-culture system with either rock phosphate (RP) or CaHPO4 (CaHP) as the P source and nitrate or ammonium nitrate as nitrogen source. A highly calcareous soil was used in the second experiment. Buckwheat was shown to be highly efficient in taking up Ca-bound P compared to spring wheat. When plants were supplied with nitrate, the total P uptake by buckwheat from RP was nearly 10-fold higher than that of spring wheat (20.1 compared with 2.1 mg P pot(-1)). Changing nitrogen source from nitrate only to ammonium nitrate increased P uptake by spring wheat substantially, but not buckwheat. High P-uptake efficiency of buckwheat was also demonstrated using the field soil, but to a lesser extent, which may be related to the difference in Zn supply between sand culture and field soil. It is suggested that buckwheat may be included in intercropping or crop rotation systems to activate P sources in calcareous soils. The principal mechanism of P uptake efficiency of buckwheat may be its ability to acidify the rhizosphere; however, further study is needed to unravel the regulation of root excretion of H+ and its molecular basis in order to exploit buckwheat's genetic capability to utilise sparingly soluble P from soil."

While the primary focus of this paper is on the production of improved, indigenous, and wild vegetables, consideration of their nutritional, medicinal and industrial importance, and genetic conservation are also outlined to provide a comprehensive overview of their contributions to the concepts of stability and sustainability of tropical agriculture. The major eco-physiological attributes of these essential plants in mixed systems are also highlighted. The major technical constraints, which are responsible for their limited use and declined production, particularly for indigenous and wild vegetables, are also outlined. The use of agronomic practices such as manipulation of plant population density, sowing, date, row arrangement, and fertilizer application to enhance growth, and complementary approaches such as mixed systems, ex situlin situ conservation, and promotion/ improvement are some of the strategies that are advocated to increase production, conservation, and use of tropical vegetables. In order to achieve effective sustainable vegetable production in Africa, a combination of indigenous and modern technologies that can be integrated feasibly is imperative.

Given this, the study aimed to identify a composition and weed infestation in a soybean area under different predecessor crops implanted in different years. The experiment was carried out in the 2019/2020 harvest in Dourados, MS. The experimental design was a randomized block with nine treatments. The treatments were composed of autumn-winter crops. The area with predecessor cultivation: corn-Brachiaria intercropping; cowpea beans; single corn; an area with predecessor cultivation of Brachiaria as pasture for one year; two years; three years; four years; five years, and six years. All treatments were followed by soybean cultivation in the 2018/2019 harvest and an intercropping with corn and Brachiaria in the 2019 off-season harvest. There was a difference in the absolute weed infestation between the evaluated areas. Treatments with corn and cowpea had greater weed infestation. However, areas with pasture or intercropping with corn and Brachiaria showed less infestation, especially in areas with Brachiaria grown in the off- season for more than two years. The weed species composition differs between the areas evaluated.

J	"Coners, H; Leuschner, C"				"Coners, H; Leuschner, C"			In situ measurement of fine root water absorption in three temperate tree species - Temporal variability and control by soil and atmospheric factors	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						"Fagus sylvatica; mature stand; miniature sap flow gauges; Picea abies; Quercus petraea; root sap flow"	"PLANT; ACQUISITION; CONDUCTANCE; FLUXES; BEECH"	Miniature heat balance-sap flow gauges were used to measure water flows in small-diameter roots (3-4 mm) in the undisturbed soil of a mature beech-oak-spruce mixed stand. By relating sap flow to the surface area of all branch fine roots distal to the gauge, we were able to calculate real time water uptake rates per root surface area (J(S)) for individual fine root systems of 0.5-1.0m in length. Study aims were (i) to quantify root water uptake of mature trees under field conditions with respect to average rates, and diurnal and seasonal changes of J(S), and (ii) to investigate the relationship between uptake and soil moisture theta, atmospheric saturation deficit D, and radiation 1. On most days, water uptake followed the diurnal course of D with a midday peak and low night flow. Neighbouring roots of the same species differed up to 10-fold in their daily totals of J(S) ( < 100-2000 g m(-2) d(-1)) indicating a large spatial heterogeneity in uptake. Beech, oak and spruce roots revealed different seasonal patterns of water uptake although they were extracting water from the same soil volume. Multiple regression analyses on the influence of D, I and theta on root water uptake showed that D was the single most influential environmental factor in beech and oak (variable selection in 77% and 79% of the investigated roots), whereas D was less important in spruce roots (50% variable selection). A comparison of root water uptake with synchronous leaf transpiration (porometer data) indicated that average water fluxes per surface area in the beech and oak trees were about 2.5 and 5.5 times smaller on the uptake side (roots) than on the loss side (leaves) given that all branch roots < 2 mm were equally participating in uptake. Beech fine roots showed maximal uptake rates on mid-summer days in the range of 48-205 g m-2 h(-1) (i.e. 0.7-3.2 mmol m(-2) s(-1)), oak of 12-160 g m(-2) h(-1) (0.2-2.5 mmol m(-2) s(-1)). transpiration rates ranged from 3 to 5 and from 5 to 6 mmol m(-2) s(-1) for sun canopy leaves of beech and oak, respectively. We conclude that instantaneous rates of root water uptake in beech, oak and spruce trees are above all controlled by atmospheric factors. The effects of different root conductivities, soil moisture, and soil hydraulic properties become increasingly important if time spans longer than a week are considered.

In this study, we investigated the influences of multiple crop types and tillage measures on water and sediment yields based on plot-scale experiments under artificial rainfall. The objective of the study is to find the best combination of crop type and tillage measure from the perspective of reducing soil erosion. We performed artificial rainfall experiments under eight slope treatments, which are the bare-land (BL, as a reference), peanut monoculture (PL), corn monoculture (CL), bare land (upper slope) mixed with peanut monoculture (lower slope) (BP), corn and peanut intercropping (TCP), corn and soybean intercropping (TCS), downslope ridge cultivation (BS) slope, and straw-mulched (SC), respectively. Under similar rainfall intensity and initial soil moisture conditions, these treatments except for BS efficiently reduced sediment yield compared to the BL slope. In comparison, the most effective slope treatment to reduce soil erosion is TCP, followed by PL and TCS. The amount of sediment yielded from the three treatments accounts for 0.4%, 2.0%, and 3.3% of the sediment yielded from BL. We recommend the three slope treatments as the preferred choices among eight treatments. Also, the lower sediment yield in the three slope treatments benefits from their higher vegetation coverage. Vegetation coverage plays a greater role in regulating sediment yield than the surface runoff at a plot scale.

JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE			English	Article						"peanut; shading; antioxidant enzyme system; photosynthesis; fluorescence; yield"	"GRAIN-YIELD; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; INTERCROPPING SYSTEMS; SOYBEAN SEEDLINGS; ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; OXIDATIVE STRESS; USE EFFICIENCY; HIGH-LIGHT; MAIZE; LEAVES"	In intercropping systems, high-positioned crops often exert shading stress on low-positioned crops, thus affecting the agronomic characteristics of the low-positioned crops. This study determined the mechanisms of photosynthetic, physiological and yield variations among peanut cultivars under shading stress. Four peanut cultivars, S60, C4, P12, and YS151, were grown in the field and subjected to shading stress for 77 days during reproductive stages. S60 and P12 showed lower yield and reduced biomass accumulation than C4 and YS151 under shading stress. Shading stress induced higher antioxidant enzyme activities in S60 and P12, relative to C4 and YS151. Under shading stress, S60 and P12 showed a higher light-trapping capability than C4 and YS151, which was associated with changes in chlorophyll (Chl) a and b contents, and Chl a/b ratio. The net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration rates of C4 and YS151 were decreased, but the intercellular CO2 concentration increased under shading stress. The results demonstrated that non-stomatal limiting factors decreased the photosynthetic capacity of peanut under shading stress. The maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII (F-v/F-m) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) were higher in S60 and P12 than in C4 and YS151 under shading stress. These results suggest that S60 and P12 could absorb more light energy from weak light environments for photosynthesis than C4 and YS151 and dissipate the excess energy in the form of heat to improve their light protection ability. This study explains the inter-variety differences in shading stress tolerance in peanut and provides physiological parameters for guiding the selection of shade-tolerant cultivars.

J	"O'Leary, N; Smith, ME"				"O'Leary, N; Smith, ME"			Uncovering corn adaptation to intercrop with bean by selecting for system yield in the intercrop environment	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE			English	Article						"corn; bean; intercrop; monoculture; selection; breeding; system yield"	"MAIZE; RELAY"	Evaluation of genetic materials bred in monoculture call provide only limited information about, the potential to improve crops for the intercrop environment. Selection in intercrop may be required to uncover the genetic variability associated with intercrop adaptation. Due to the expense and difficulty associated with selection in the intercrop environment, Its use must be justified by the superiority of materials selected in it over materials selected in monoculture. The aim of this study was to compare the improvement of overall performance in corn-bean (Zea mays L.-Phaseolus vulgaris L.) intercrop that resulted from intercrop selection, with that which resulted from selection in monoculture. Three cycles of divergent recurrent selection were used to generate two sets of improved corn families: YM selected for corn yield in monoculture and YS selected for system yield (corn yield plus three times bean yield) in corn-bean intercrop. YS allowed significantly (P < 0.01) higher bean yield and had higher system yield than YM. YS was also significantly shorter (P < 0.05), less leafy (P < 0.001), and had a more erect canopy (P < 0.05) than YM. Selection for system yield in intercrop uncovered adaptation to the intercrop environment that was not matched by selection for corn yield in monoculture. This justifies the use of the intercrop breeding environment for improvement of productivity from corn-bean intercrops.

After two years, 81-88% of the applied nitrogen was recovered; 98.4-98.7% of the recovered nitrogen occurred in the top 45 cm of the moss-peat layer and 1.3-1.6% occurred in the above ground shrub component In the bog, 29% was recovered from the top 0-5 cm of Sphagnum fuscum, while in the fen 19% was recovered from this zone in Tomenthypnum nitens. Sphagnum sequestered the applied nitrogen more efficiently than did Tomenthypnum. However, over time Tomenthypnum retained it better in the upper moss layers. Overall, after two years Sphagnum retained 42% and Tomenthypnum 48% in the top 12 cm of the ground layer. The nitrogen of the current year's moss growth contained 26-28% applied nitrogen (% NDFF) after one season and 19-20% after two seasons. Moss production increased from 4-30% annually over the two year period, while production for Betula pumila in the fen and Ledum groenlandicum in the bog did not increase significantly. Decomposition of S. fuscum in the bag was significantly less than T. nitens in the fen after two years, but no differences were evident after nitrogen additions in either peatlands. We conclude that I) nearly all nitrogen is immediately sequestered by the mass layer; 2) much of this new nitrogen is found in the actively growing region and mass production increases; 3) shrubs are little affected by the additional nitrogen during the first two years and direct absorption of nitrogen through leaves is unimportant and 4) newly deposited nitrogen is tightly controlled by the moss layer in both bogs and fens. However retention patterns are different. Subsequent use of nitrogen by vascular plants is determined by nutrient release through decompositional processes deeper in the moss layer."

Treatments consisted of monocrops and intercrops of sorghum and cowpea and an additional pair of monocultures and mixtures protected by insecticides. Intercropping reduced the numbers of stem borer, Chile partellus in sorghum and thrips, Megalurothrips, sjostedti in cowpea. In the monocropped, unprotected sorghum, yield was reduced by 28% compared to the protected monocrop, while reduction in the unprotected intercropped sorghum was 15% compared to the protected intercrop. Similarly, in the unprotected cowpea, monocrop yield was reduced by 94% and intercrop yield was reduced by 51%. Thus, there are yield advantages under conditions where intercropping reduces insect pest density. Intercropping can form a component of an integrated pest management programme.

The study considered two slope positions: upslope (5.8%), and downslope (2.3%), and two land-use types: tilled maize-beans (TMB) intercrop and fallow shrub-grassland (FSG). Runoff was measured from September to November 2014 and from July to October 2015. The rainfall-runoff events in 2014 and 2015 were subjected to statistical analysis. The CN was computed with rainfall-runoff data. The results showed a significant (p < 0.05) effect of land use on surface runoff in 2015.

Intra- and inter-specific density affects plant growth responses to arbuscular mycorrhizas	BOTANY			English	Article						"intraspecific competition; interspecific competition; facilitation; arbuscular mycorrhizas; facultative mycotrophs; yield-density model"	"COMPETITION; PHOSPHORUS; DIVERSITY; INFECTION; FUNGI; AVAILABILITY; DEPENDENCE; SYMBIOSES"	Arbuscular mycorrhizas can alter competitive interactions between plants that markedly differ in their dependence upon mycorrhizas, but little is known about how mycorrhizas affect intra- and inter-specific competition between similarly dependent plant species. We conducted competition experiments in pots between all pairs of the similarly facultatively mycotrophic crop species, chili (Capsicum annuum L.). maize (Zea mays L.), and Zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L.). We used a two-species yield-density model to analyze the separate effects of mycorrhizal inoculation, intra-, and inter-specific density on biomass responses. Mycorrhizas reduced the growth of all three plant species. Intraspecific competition increased the negative effect of mycorrhizas, as did interspecific competition at low intraspecific density. At high intraspecific density, however, interspecific competition improved plant responsiveness to mycorrhizas. Enhancement of plant benefit from mycorrhizas at high interspecific density of competing, weakly mycorrhiza-dependent species may help to explain the evolutionary maintenance of their associations with mycorrhizal fungi, and may be a key to understanding intercrop combinations that exceed the monoculture yields of component species.

Intercropping legumes and grasses is a strategy for improving resource use and sustainability in cropping systems. Here, we show for the first time the agronomic performance of IWG as a perennial cereal grown as a monocrop and as an intercrop (alternate row, 0.5:0.5) with Medicago sativa L. (alfalfa/lucerne) in southern Sweden. The seeds of cycle 3 IWG were accessed from The Land Institute (TLI) of Salinas, Kansas, USA, and used to establish a local seed production plot (in 2014) for the establishment of the perennial systems (in 2016) utilised in this study. Both the monocrop and intercrop were sown with 25 cm row spacing with alternate rows of IWG and alfalfa in the intercrop (i.e. replacement design) with unknown sowing density. Intercropping provided sustained IWG grain production under the dry conditions of 2018, but also in the following year. This was evidently associated with a higher nitrogen accumulation in intercropped practice. Thus, intercropping seems to have stabilised the IWG grain production in the dry conditions of 2018, when the grain production in the intercrop was similar to that of the monocrop in the same year. This result was further supported by the lower discrimination against C-13 (as an indicator of water use efficiency) in the intercrop components compared to the sole crop in 2018. The lower discrimination indicates high water use efficiency in the intercropped IWG in comparison to the IWG in monoculture, and we conclude that intercropping perennial cereal grain crops with legumes provides better growing conditions in terms of nitrogen acquisition, and water status, to cope with more extreme drought spells expected from climate change.

Soil management practices in agroecosystems, such as the use of green manures (GM), positively affect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Objective. The objective of the research was to evaluate CO2,CH4, and N2O emission of a soil cultivated with corn and soybean under the use of green fertilizers, fallow (B), and nitrogen fertilization. Materials and methods. Between July 2011 and June 2012, in a Typic Haplustert located in Valle del Cauca, Colombia, corn and soybeans were planted in a intervleaved manner, and the monocultures of corn and soybeans were managed in a conventional manner. The association between Mucuna pruriens var. utilis and maize was established as GM, ninety days after sowing, the total residues were incorporated as GM or disposed on the soil surface as organic mulch (AO). Eleven treatments were used under the design of randomized complete blocks, with 3(2) + 2 factorial arrangement, with three repetitions. The main plots were GM, AO and B. Each was divided into subplots corresponding to compost fertilization, industrial chemical synthesis fertilizer and no additions. In the flowering and grain filling stage of the crops, variables such as N2O, CH4, CO2 and total water-filled porosity were analyzed. Results. CO2 flow was higher in the intercrops added with GM/AO compared to monocultures. In the main plots, the use of industrial chemical synthesis fertilizers significantly stimulated N2O and CH4 fluxes. Conclusion. The use of high quality organic materials such as GM/AO did not ensure GHG sink soils in the short-term, since soil conditions and nitrogen fertilization significantly influenced emissions.

J	PRIADKA, J				PRIADKA, J			COMPARISON OF GREEN FODDER YIELDS IN SOME VARIETIES OF WINTER CEREAL INTERCROPS	ROSTLINNA VYROBA			Czech	Article								"Field experiments were conducted on loamy degraded chernozem with weakly acid soil reaction, in maize-production region, at an altitude of 167 m, average long-term yearly temperature 9.2 degrees C and long-term yearly sum of precipitation 625 mm, over the years 1990 to 1992 to study the effect of gradated rates of nitrogen in relation to the green fodder yields of rye varieties (diploid Dankovske nove, tetraploid Beskyd), triticale (Korm and Dagro) and wheat-vetch mixture (Viginta + Arida). Basic fertilization was performed in autumn before sowing at rates 35 kg P.ha(-1) and 80 kg K.ha(-1). N-fertilization was as follows: 50 kg.ha(-1) in autumn, after emergence; 100 kg.ha(-1) (50 kg in autumn and 50 kg in early spring); 150 kg.ha(-1) (75 kg in autumn and 75 kg in early spring). The seeding rate of rye was 4.5 mil., of triticale 4.0 mil., and of wheat-vetch mixture 4.0 + 1.0 mil. of emerged grains per 1 ha. Seeding depth was 30 to 40 mm and row spacing 125 mm. The field trial consisted of 15 variants and was in a split-plot randomized complete block with four replications. Plots were of area 1.6m by 8.0m = 12.80 m(2), harvested area was 10 m(2). Harvest was performed at the beginning of earing of each cereal with a small-plot harvester combine MPZ-115 of digital weight. The following methods were used to determine content of elements: N - according to Dumas on instrument Leco CHN-600; P, K, Ca, Mg - according to Mehlich II. Obtained numeric data of green fodder yield were subjected to analysis of variance. In trial arranged varieties have been differed in green fodder yields for average of years. The differences (from 5.0 to 30.9%) were highly statistically significant and ranged from 2.66 to 16.31 t.ha(-1) (Tab. I). The highest green fodder yield was obtained with the variety Korm, exceeding the mean of set by 11.5%. The wheat-vetch mixture in our conditions gave by 10.87 t.ha(-1) lower yield than resulted in the mean total set (47.26 t.ha(-1)). The influence of N-fertilization was in negative correlation to green fodder yield in spite of increasing N rate up to 100 kg.ha(-1) (Fig. 1.). The influences of meteorological factors, year and varieties on green fodder yields were more expressive than other factors. The best yearly yield stability was recorded with variety Dankovske nove with later earing stage. The later earing stage was recorded by other varieties: Beskyd for 2 days, Dagro for 10 days, Korm for 12 days and wheat-vetch mixture for 14 days later. In view of the highest green fodder yield, the following sequence arose: Korm (52.7 t.ha(-1)), Dankovske nove (50.04 t.ha(-1)), Dagro (49.18 t.ha(-1)), Beskyd (47.88 t.ha(-1)) and wheat-vetch mixture (36.39 t.ha(-1). N, P, K taken by the harvested crop is expressed by uptake index (Tab II). Quantity by harvest-removed N and K was greater than received by soil in the form of mineral fertilizers. Average uptake index for P (88.5 to 96.9%) refers to the balance, but wheat-vetch mixture has utilized P supplied by fertilizers in 65.8 to 78.4% only."

This leguminous forage plant has a stoloniferous growth habit and tolerates more intense defoliation and shading. However, there are few studies on its symbiosis with nitrogen (N-2) fixing bacteria and no studies on genetic identification of its native microsymbionts. The aim of this study was to evaluate phenotypic and genetic diversity and the symbiotic efficiency of bacterial strains isolated from nodules of forage peanut intercropped with grasses in pasture areas. Root nodules were collected from the Belomonte cultivar in Isabela, Bahia, and BRS Mandobi cultivar in Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The areas of sample collection had contrasting physical and chemical characteristics. Samples of 10 plants per area and 5 nodules per plant were taken. The strains isolated from the nodules were analyzed for culture characteristics (growth period and change in pH of the culture medium), their 16S rRNA, gyrB and nifH genes were partially sequenced, and authentication and analysis of symbiotic efficiency in forage peanut plants were carried out. Both the authentication and symbiotic efficiency experiments were carried out in a greenhouse under axenic conditions, using A. pintoi cv. BRS Mandobi in a completely randomized design with four replications. Authentication was performed in long neck bottles (500 mL) filled with nutrient solution, and symbiotic efficiency was performed in polypropylene seedling plug pots containing a mixture of sand and vermiculite with a nutrient solution. A total of 74 bacterial strains were obtained from isolation of the forage peanut nodules, 40 from Isabela, and 34 from Lavras. Partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was obtained for 48 strains, 30 from Isabela, and 18 from Lavras. The strains isolated from nodules of forage peanut in pasture areas of Isabela, were identified in the following genera: Bradyrhizobium (21), Rhizobium (5), Burkholderia (2), Kocuria (1), and Paenibacillus (1). The strains coming from soils of Lavras, were identified in the following genera: Bradyrhizobium (13), Rhizobium (2), Burkholderia (1), Mucilaginibacter (1), and Enterobacter (1). In the authentication experiment, 17 strains from Isabela, and 13 strains from Lavras, exhibited nodulation. From these authenticated strains, 18 were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing as belonging to the Bradyrhizobium genus. Of these strains, 11 from the two areas exhibited high symbiotic efficiency in A. pintoi, and their results were better than those of the strains currently approved as inoculants for this crop. The non-nodulating strains are probably nodule endophytes. Sequencing of the gyrB housekeeping gene, performed in 13 strains, confirms phylogenetic groups of potential new species among the strains isolated from A. pintoi, which include strains able to nodulate this species, belonging to a specific phylogenetic group of Bradyrhizobium. Sequences of nifH gene of efficient strains belonged to a group different from that formed by non-nodulating strains.

Strategies involving genes in the dehydration-responsive element binding (DREB) family, which participates in drought stress regulation, and intercropping with legumes are becoming prominent options in promoting sustainable sugarcane cultivation. An increasing number of studies focusing on root interactions in intercropping systems, particularly involving transgenic crops, are being conducted to better understand and thus, harness beneficial soil microbes to enhance plant growth. We designed experiments to investigate the characteristics of two intercropping patterns, soybean with wild-type (WT) sugarcane and soybean with genetically modified (GM) Ea-DREB2B-overexpressing sugarcane, to assess the response of the rhizosphere microbiota to the different cropping patterns. Bacterial diversity in the rhizosphere microbial community differed between the two intercropping pattens. In addition, the biomass of GM sugarcane that intercropped with soybean was significantly improved compared with WT sugarcane, and the aboveground biomass and root biomass of GM soybean intercropping sugarcane increased by 49.15 and 46.03% compared with monoculture. Furthermore, a beneficial rhizosphere environment for the growth of Actinobacteria was established in the systems intercropped with GM sugarcane. Improving the production mode of crops by genetic modification is a key strategy to improving crop yields and provides new opportunities to further investigate the effects of intercropping on plant roots and soil microbiota. Thus, this study provides a basis for selecting suitable sugarcane-soybean intercropping patterns and a theoretical foundation for a sustainable sugarcane production.

These yield advantages have often been attributed to complementary resource use, but few studies quantified the temporal complementarity of nutrient acquisition and biomass production. Our understanding of how nutrient uptake rates of nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) and biomass accumulation change throughout the growing season and between different neighbors is limited. We conducted weekly destructive harvests to measure temporal trajectories of N and P uptake and biomass production in three crop species (oat, lupin, and camelina) growing either as isolated single plants, in monocultures or as intercrops. Additionally, we quantified organic acid exudation in the rhizosphere and biological N-2-fixation of lupin throughout the growing season. Logistic models were fitted to characterize nutrient acquisition and biomass accumulation trajectories. Nutrient uptake and biomass accumulation trajectories were curtailed by competitive interactions, resulting in earlier peak rates and lower total accumulated nutrients and biomass compared to cultivation as isolated single plants. Different pathways led to overyielding in the two mixtures. The oat-camelina mixture was characterized by a shift from belowground temporal niche partitioning of resource uptake to aboveground competition for light during the growing season. The oat-lupin mixture showed strong competitive interactions, where lupin eventually overyielded due to reliance on atmospheric N and stronger competitiveness for soil P compared to oat. Synthesis: This study demonstrates temporal shifts to earlier peak rates of plants growing with neighbors compared to those growing alone, with changes in uptake patterns suggesting that observed temporal shifts in our experiment were driven by competitive interactions rather than active plant behavior to reduce competition. The two differing pathways to overyielding in the two mixtures highlight the importance of examining temporal dynamics in intercropping systems to understand the underlying mechanisms of overyielding.

Inter- and intra-species intercropping of barley cultivars and legume species, as affected by soil phosphorus availability	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						"Legume; Barley; Phosphorus availability; Plant diversity; Yield; Phosphorus uptake"	"GENETIC DIVERSITY; PASTURE LEGUMES; ORGANIC-ACIDS; DURUM-WHEAT; RHIZOSPHERE; INCREASE; GROWTH; ROOT; PRODUCTIVITY; ACQUISITION"	Intercropping can improve plant yields and soil phosphorus (P) use efficiency. This study compares inter- and intra-species intercropping, and determines whether P uptake and shoot biomass accumulation in intercrops are affected by soil P availability. Four barley cultivars (Hordeum vulgare L.) and three legume species (Trifolium subterreneum, Ornithopus sativus and Medicago truncatula) were selected on the basis of their contrasting root exudation and morphological responses to P deficiency. Monocultures and barley-barley and barley-legume intercrops were grown for 6 weeks in a pot trial at very limiting, slightly limiting and excess available soil P. Above-ground biomass and shoot P were measured. Barley-legume intercrops had 10-70% greater P accumulation and 0-40% greater biomass than monocultures, with the greatest gains occurring at or below the sub-critical P requirement for barley. No benefit of barley-barley intercropping was observed. The plant combination had no significant effect on biomass and P uptake observed in intercropped treatments. Barley-legume intercropping shows promise for sustainable production systems, especially at low soil P. Gains in biomass and P uptake come from inter- rather than intra-species intercropping, indicating that plant diversity resulted in decreased competition between plants for P.

Species used in mixture and seeding ratio in the mixture affect hay yield due to competition between crops. A two year field study was conducted to determine the effects of mixture common vetch with oat and triticale on hay yield, quality and competition between the species in Eastern Black Sea Region (Ordu). Aggressivity, competitive ratio and LER were used to assess competition between mixture component. Species was sown monocrops and in common vetch-cereal mixture in three seeding ratios (75:25, 50:50, 25:75, respectively). The plots were harvested vetch was at the lowest pod filling stage, at that time triticale was at flowering and oat was at milk-dough stage. The results of the study showed that hay, crude protein and digestible dry matter yield of mixtures were higher than monocrops. Additionally, yield of mixtures changed with year, but, 50:50 triticale: vetch had more stable yield. Furthermore, A and CR values indicated cereals were more competitive than common vetch when it was rainy in fall and winter. All common vetch- cereal intercrops have yield advantage (LER> 1), but, sowing 50:50 mixtures of common vetch: triticale or oat (LER= 1.4) were found to be the most profitable. 50:50 mixtures of common vetch: triticale or oat should be suggested in similar regions.

Intercropping sunflower and soybean in intensive farming systems: Evaluating yield advantage and effect on weed and insect assemblages	NJAS-WAGENINGEN JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article						"Agricultural intensification; Agro-ecosystems; Biodiversity; Intercropping; Multifunctional agriculture"	"ROLLING PAMPA; LAND-USE; COMMUNITIES; BIODIVERSITY; MANAGEMENT; CAPTURE; PEA"	Agricultural intensification has encouraged both landscape homogenization and biodiversity decline in agro-ecosystems. Intercropping may over yield sole crops and simultaneously enhance landscape heterogeneity and planned and associated biodiversity in agroecosystems. Thus, we assessed yield advantage in sunflower/soybean intercrops in the Southern Pampas (Argentina). We also expected weed and insect assemblages to differ between sole crops and intercrops and to be more diverse and productive in intercrops than in sole crops. Thus, we evaluated the effects of sunflower/soybean sole and intercrops on the composition, richness, and abundance of weed and insect assemblages. Sunflower/soybean sole crops and intercrops were sown in two experiments in the Southern Pampa during two consecutive years. Weeds and insects were surveyed and both crop yields and land equivalent ratio (LER) were calculated. Cover/abundance of weeds, abundance of insects and species frequency and richness of both taxa were also estimated. Weeds were classified according to life cycle (annual or perennial) and insects according to feeding habits (herbivores and non-herbivores). Yield advantage of intercropping was indicated by LER values higher than 1 in both experiments, indicating that intercrops were more productive than sole crops. Species compositions of weed and insect assemblages differed between sole crops and intercrops because some particular species characterized each cropping system. Total species number was higher in intercrops than in sole crops. However, mean richness and abundance per plot was similar among treatments for weeds and similar or lower in intercrops than in the rest of treatments for insects. Here, we show that intercropping warm-season crops constitute a feasible alternative to promote heterogeneity within-fields and therefore sustain biodiversity in conventional cropping systems in temperate regions, which have become highly simplified after agricultural intensification such as in the Southern Pampa.

To utilize these fallows for rainy season cropping and improving water use efficiency, a field experiment was carried out for three consecutive years (2009-2012) in arid zone. The experiment was laid out in split plot design with two planting systems i.e. bed planting and conventional planting in main plots and five rainy season cropping systems in sub plots viz., sorghum intercropped with Sesbania (green manuring/brown manuring), green gram and cowpea in 2:2 ratio and sole sorghum replicated thrice. In the succeeding wheat crop, each plot was further sub divided into two for applying two levels of nitrogen i.e. 90 and 120 kg ha(-1). The irrigation water for wheat was slightly saline (4.1 dS m(-1)). Bed planting significantly improved yield of intercropped pulses i.e. green gram and cowpea by 31.8% and 27.5% over conventional planting while, yield of sorghum decreased by 13.7%. During winter season, bed planting improved number of grains spike(-1) and 1000 grain weight (43.3 g) that had compensated the decrease in spike density of wheat (19.2%). Bed planting saved 19-24% of irrigation and hence water productivity improved by 30%. Marked improvement in soil physical properties, dry root mass (81.5%) and nutrient status of soil i.e. soil organic carbon, available N and P was observed under this system. Salinity built up during winter season was below the threshold level for wheat and almost all the accumulated salts leached down during succeeding rainy season. Significant improvement in yield attributing characters of sorghum was observed under sorghum + green gram/cowpea intercropping system. Rainy season sorghum-legume intercropping had marked residual effect on succeeding wheat crop with maximum 19.1% yield increase being under sorghum + Sesbania (green manuring) treatment. During third crop cycle, this treatment saved 25% fertilizer nitrogen to wheat and significantly increased soil organic carbon status. However, highest system productivity and net returns were recorded under sorghum + green gram-wheat system (8265 kg ha(-1) wheat grain equivalent yield). This was at par with sorghum + cowpea-wheat system. From the present study, it may be concluded that the productivity and water use efficiency of traditional fallow-wheat system could be increased by utilizing wheat fallow for growing sorghum + green gram/cowpea intercrops in 2:2 ratio under bed planting system.

J	"Amosse, C; Jeuffroy, MH; David, C"				"Amosse, Camille; Jeuffroy, Marie-Helene; David, Christophe"			Relay intercropping of legume cover crops in organic winter wheat: Effects on performance and resource availability	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Intercropping; Grain protein content; Grain yield; Soil water content; Nitrogen uptake; Intercepted radiation; Organic farming"	"DIFFERENT LIVING MULCHES; NO-TILL SYSTEM; UNDERSOWING WHEAT; TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; WEED MANAGEMENT; SOIL N; COMPETITION; NITROGEN; GROWTH; CEREAL"	Wheat yields and grain protein content are lower and more variable in organic conditions than in conventional agriculture, mainly due to nitrogen (N) deficiency and weed competition. The undersowing of legume cover crops in growing winter wheat, also known as relay intercropping, is assumed to be a proficient way of enriching the soil-crop system with N and improving weed control. However, competition for resources may impair wheat performance. Relay intercropping in springtime in growing winter wheat is expected to limit competition for resources from the legume. The aim of our study was to analyze wheat performance and resource competition in relay intercropping systems with legume cover crops under various environmental conditions. Eight field experiments were conducted on organic grain-oriented farms located in southeast France. Black medic (Medicago lupulina), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), red clover (Trifolium pratense) and white clover (Trifolium repens), undersown at wheat tillering stage, were compared with a sole crop of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Lona). The aerial biomass of wheat and legumes and total N content of wheat were determined at both the flowering stage and harvest time of the wheat. The main trophic resources (water, N and light) were monitored at similar stages. Wheat grain yield and grain protein content were also measured. Sites were classified according to wheat sole crop performance at harvest to evaluate the effect of relay intercropping in the various conditions tested. In all but one of the thirty-two treatments, wheat grain yield was not significantly disturbed by relay intercropping whatever the aerial development of legumes. Abundant aerial development of legumes after flowering (>20% of the aerial biomass of wheat at harvest) was associated with a mean significant decrease in wheat grain protein content of 8.5% of the control treatment value, this occurring in one third of the situations. These ratios of aerial biomasses of legumes compared to wheat were also associated with reductions in soil moisture and wheat N uptake. The effect on the availability of trophic resources for wheat may have led to a decrease in grain protein content without having any effect on grain yield. Sites which registered a low performance for wheat sole crops were less negatively impacted by the presence and aerial development of legumes. The performance of the four legume species and the mechanisms of induced disturbance of resource availability are then discussed. Finally, we try to define ranges of legumes' development and resource availability in which wheat performance was maintained or limited. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that these positive interactions are supported by rhizosphere processes that increase P availability, such as root-induced pH changes. In neutral and alkaline soils legumes are assumed to increase inorganic P availability by rhizosphere acidification due to N-2 fixation which benefit to the intercropped cereal. Growth, P uptake, changes in inorganic P availability and pH in the rhizosphere of intercropped species were thus investigated in a greenhouse pot experiment with durum wheat and chickpea either grown alone or intercropped. We used a neutral soil from a P fertilizer long-term field trial exhibiting either low (-P) or high (+P) P availability. Phosphorus availability was increased in the rhizosphere of both species, especially when intercropped in -P. Such increase was associated with alkalization. Rhizosphere pH changes could not fully explain the observed changes of P availability though. Low rates of N-2 fixation may explain why no rhizosphere acidification was observed. Increases in P availability did not lead to enhanced P uptake but growth promotion was observed for durum wheat intercropped with chickpea in P soil. Our hypothesis of an increase in inorganic P availability in intercropping as a consequence of root-induced acidification by the legume was not validated, and we suggested that root-induced alkalization was involved instead, as well as other root-induced processes. Thus, the cereal through rhizosphere alkalization may also enhance P uptake and growth of the intercropped legume. Facilitation can thus occur in both ways. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Nitrous oxide emissions and nitrate leaching in an arable rotation resulting from the presence of an intercrop	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"Barley; Clover; Greenhouse gases; Legumes; Nitrate leaching; N2O"	"TRIFOLIUM-REPENS L.; AGRICULTURAL SOILS; GRAIN LEGUMES; CROP; N2O; PEA; SYSTEMS; GRASS; N-15; TEMPERATURE"	"The effects of cereal legume intercropping on nitrogen dynamics and losses from an arable rotation are reported. The main hypotheses were that: (a) intercrops can reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions relative to those from cereal monocrops; (b) the choice of legume cultivars can change N losses from a system and also influence soil available-N. Two field experiments were established in the east of Scotland. The treatments in 2006 consisted of either component monocrops (barley, oat, pea or clover) or cereal-legume intercrops. Spring oats were planted in 2007 and perennial ryegrass in 2008 on both sites. Nitrate leaching was reduced under legume intercrops when compared with the barley monocrop (cumulative values of 0.67 and 3.80 kg NO3- -N ha(-1), respectively) in 2006. Nitrous oxide losses were significantly different between the treatments and especially the two barley/pea cultivar (cumulative values of 6.02 and 2.14 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for intercrops cv. Nitouche and cv. Zero 4, respectively) in 2006. The leguminous intercrops increased the soil available-N during the first growing season and in the subsequent crop. Thus intercrops may reduce N losses and this work highlights the need to choose suitable cultivars, taking into account the effects upon the growth of the main crop and the wider environment effects.

Results obtained in evaluation on interactions of levels of weed+different levels of intercropping showed that highest and lowest total yield of dry forage were related to seed ratios of 75% narbon bean+25% barley+control and 25% narbon bean+75% barley+control equivalent to 7.22 and 3.85 t/ha, respectively. Results also showed that interactions among these levels about traits like number of fertile tillers and number of pods/plant and 1000-seed weight of narbon bean were significant, but were not significant with number of seeds/spike and pod and 1000-seed weight of barley and narbon bean. Maximum yield (2.88 t/ha) was attributed to sole cropping of barlev+control and minimum yield (2.41 t/ha) to the treatment 50% narbon bean+50% barley+control. Average of least rate of production (3 t/ha) was attributed to the combination of 25% narbon bean+75% barley+polluted to weed and it was highest (3.32 t/ha) to seed ratio of 50% narbon bean+50% barley+polluted to weed. Total LER in seed ratio of 75% narbon bean+25% barley+control of weeds was higher than other treatments (1.58).

Merr.] and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] as sole and intercrop in 6 nutrient combinations. Integrated use of farmyard manure @ 5 tonnes/ha or phosphocompost @ 5 tonnes/ha or poultry manure @ 1.5 tonnes/ha along with 75% NPK improved the root length density (42.4%), root mass density (95.9%) and root volume density (80.8%) and registered higher seasonal evapo-transpiration (4.4%), total dry-matter yield (12.9%) and seed yield (12.7%) over application of 100% NPK irrespective of the cropping systems. Also there was an improvement in the root-length density of intercrop sorghum (111.5%) over its sole crop in the 0-15 cm soil layer. The seasonal evapo-transpiration showed a quadratic relationship with the total dry-matter yield in sole soybean, sole sorghum and soybean+sorghum intercropping system. The optimum seasonal evapo-transpiration for maximum dry-matter yield of sole soybean, sole sorghum and soybean + sorghum intercropping system was 605.5 mm, 529.7 mm and 576.2 mm respectively. The seed yield of intercrop soybean decreased by 8% and that of intercrop sorghum increased by 7% over the corresponding sole crops. Among the organic sources the effect of farmyard manure was more prominent in soybean, while poultry manure was more effective in sorghum for seed yield, seasonal evapo-transpiration and root growth.

We analyse the effects of both a fertiliser and a seed subsidy on farming households' land allocation among crops and crop diversity in Burkina Faso. Although previous studies investigated either the impact of a fertiliser or a seed subsidy on targeted crops, few examined the effects of both subsidies combined. Applying a correlated random-effects model with a control function approach to nationally representative, 2-year panel data collected from farming households, we find that those with access to the fertiliser subsidy allocate more land to the crops it targets (rice, maize and cotton) than non-targeted crops. Focusing on a minor crop with key agronomic and nutritional attributes, we conclude that land allocation to cowpea as the primary crop and intercrop declined with the fertiliser subsidy. The fertiliser subsidy also negatively affects crop diversity. However, we find that the cowpea seed subsidy offsets the bias of fertiliser subsidy toward fertiliser-targeted crops and enhances diversity.

Although such practices have helped to restore soil carbon in most cases, the impact on N2O emissions has not been investigated yet. The soil N2O fluxes and concentrations were measured during the growing season of an intercropping maize-soybean on a clayey soil of the Malagasy Highlands. Management treatments consisted of direct seeding mulch based cropping system (DMC) and traditional hand-ploughing after the preceding crop residues were harvested (HP), both with low N inputs (55-57 kg N ha(-1)). No significant difference in N2O emissions was observed between treatments (DMC vs. HP). The N2O fluxes were weakly correlated to soil mineral N contents (R-2=0.13; P=0.03) while no relationship was emphasized with soil water filled pore space (WFPS), N2O Concentrations in the soil atmosphere were correlated to fluxes at the soil surface and to soil WFPS. N2O emissions at the soil surface were low ranging from 0 to 8.84 g N-N2O ha(-1) d(-1), probably due to the low mineral N content of soil. The cumulative annual N2O emission was 0.26 kg N ha(-1) for both systems. The corresponding N loss as N2O-N was around 0.5% of applied N. This is in the uncertainty range of IPCC N2O emission factor (EF), but the IPCC EF mean estimate (1%) would overestimate true N2O emissions for the soil under evaluation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This study was conducted to assess the effect of incorporating legumes into the potato production system on ground cover, soil moisture content (SMC), tuber and legume yield, potato equivalent yield (PEY), gross and net income and benefit: cost ratio (BCR). The treatments comprised of pure potato stand (PS), potato-dolichos (Lablab purpureus L.) (PD), potato-garden pea (Pisum sativum L.) (PG) and potato-bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) (PB). Results indicated a significantly higher (69%) ground cover at tuber initiation stage in PD compared to 66% in PG and PB and 56% in PS. Similarly, the highest SMC values were recorded at tuber initiation stage: 230, 207, 201 and 188 mm m -1 in PD, PG, PB and PS, respectively. Fresh tuber yield was highest in PS (36 t ha -1) and PD (35 t ha -1) and lowest in PG (29 t ha - 1). PEY was higher under intercropping than monocropping systems. Potato-dolichos was the most profitable intercropping system with a net income of US$ 9174 ha -1 and a BCR of 5.7 compared to PS (US$ 7436 ha - 1) with a BCR of 5.1. The study showed that dolichos is a promising legume crop that could be integrated into potato cropping systems to improve CWP without compromising the tuber yield.

Initially, the genetic variability with respect to N uptake was assessed by screening five varieties of chicory (Cichorium intybus L.), four of peas (Pisum sativum L.) and three of red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) in combination with eight isolates of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The most promising plant - fungi combinations identified through the cultivar screening were used to optimise conditions for N transfer between intercropped N-2-fixing plants (peas and clover) and non-N-2-fixing chicory. In the first experiment, the recovery of fixed legume N was investigated using three cultivars, of chicory intercropped with pea variety, and inoculated with one of four mycorrhizal isolates. Roots of the N-2-fixing pea and the non-N-2-fixing chicory were separated by a root-free soil layer in a three-compartment container. A section of the legume roots was forced to grow into a separate compartment which received four split applications of N-15. Th, percentage of N in the chicory derived from transfer ranged between 3% and 50%. In a second experiment one chicory variety was intercropped with one red clover variety and inoculated with four mycorrhizal isolates respectively. A harvest regime was chosen in which the shoots were harvested from intercropped plants at 3,4.5 and 6 months of age. At three months the percentage of N in the chicory derived from transfer ranged between 15% and 18% and at a plant age of 4.5 months from 46 to 77%. At six months the percentage of N in the chicory roots derived from transfer of legume N ranged from 20 to 34% and varied with fungal isolate. Our results show that there is potential for improving N transfer in intercropped plant systems through the methodological selection of suitable plant and mycorrhizal partners.

However, it is unknown whether IC improve the soil health status and biomass productivity of crops cultivated in podzols under cool climate in boreal ecosystems. Two silage corn and three forage soybean genotypes were cultivated either as inter or monocrop (MC) treatments in a randomized complete block design. IC resulted in 28% increase in total forage production (FP). A reduction in rhizosphere soil pH (RS-pH) was observed in the IC treatments. Conversely, the rhizosphere soil acid phosphatase (RS-APase) activity was significantly higher (26-46%) in the IC treatments and occurred concomitant with a significant increase in available phosphorus (RS-P-available) (26-74%) in the rhizosphere. Furthermore, IC enhanced the active microbial composition and strong positive correlations were observed between RS-P-available, RS-APase, microbial biomass and FP; while RS-pH was negatively correlated with FP, RS-APase and RS-P-available. These findings suggested silage corn intercropped with forage soybean could be a viable approach to enhance FP through improved active microbial community structure, RS-APase activity and RS-P-available when cultivated on podzols in cool climate boreal ecosystem."

In this experiment, we designed ten cropping patterns to optimise the rotation effect with different combinations of crop types, planting years, and order in a mainly potato-growing region. A 5-year cycle with three crops, undertaken in Inner Mongolia since 2009, was used to test soil properties and microbial structure. The relative abundance of plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) was 32.1% in the cycle oats oats alfalfa alfalfa alfalfa and 22.4% in 5-year mono-cropping of alfalfa, which was higher than that of mono-cropping of potatoes and other crop rotations. Soil moisture was the main factor influencing bacterial and fungal communities. The effect of the type of plant introduced into the rotation on soil was greater than that of the number of years a certain crop was planted in the rotation, and this effect was greater than that of planting order. The findings suggest that the rotation of oats and alfalfa mixed -> alfalfa -> oats -> potatoes -> potatoes is a suitable 5-year cycle to maintain biodiversity and better soil physico-chemical properties for sustainable agriculture.

The aim of this study was to quantify the effectiveness of some soil ameliorants applied in combination with a reduced dosage of NPK fertilizer on soil properties and soybean yield, in a young rubber and soybean intercropped system on acid upland soil. The study was conducted in East Lampung Indonesia from April to July 2013. The plots were designed in a split-plot with three replications. The main plots were the level of NPK fertilizer recommendation dosage (100% and 75%). The subplots were soil ameliorants. The results showed that a 25% reduction of NPK did not significantly affect the soil properties and soybean yield when applied with soil ameliorants. Application of dolomite 2 t/ha and Biochar SP50 2.5 t/ha reduced soil exchangeable Al content by 25.3% and 20.8% respectively. Dolomite was the most effective to increase soil pH, whilst Biochar SP50 provided the highest soil available water pores (15.25% vol.). Soybean gave better yield when the soil was treated with dolomite, Biochar SP50, and organic fertilizer plus. Reduction in soil acidity and improvement of soil available water pores most likely were responsible factors to give better yields of soybean planted on acid soil.

R.Br.). Three tillage treatments, viz. minimum tillage (one harrowing), conventional tillage (two harrowing, cross) and deep tillage (ploughing followed by two harrowings), and four cropping systems, viz. monoculture of pearl millet, pearl millet-clusterbean (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taub.) rotation, monoculture of pearl millet with 5 t ha(-1) farm yard manure (FYM), and intercropping of pearl miller and clusterbean, were compared. Deep tillage improved the soil moisture storage, water use efficiency and grain yield of pearl millet while consumptive use of water was higher with minimum tillage. Total dry matter yield with deep tillage and conventional tillage was 23.2 and 10.2% higher than minimum tillage in the season 1, and the corresponding values for season 2 were 30.7 and 13.3%. The Pearl millet-clusterbean rotation and monoculture of pearl millet with the application of 5 t ha(-1) FYM gave 17.2 and 6.1% higher yield than monoculture of pearl millet, respectively.

The experiment was carried out in two crop years, in a randomized complete block design, in a 2x2x3 factorial arrangement, with five replicates. The first evalauted factor was composed of the two constrasting soils: a clayey Rhodic Eutrustox and a sandy Rhodic Haplustox. The second factor was corn cultivation: single and intercropped with U. ruziziensis. The third factor consisted of the inoculation onto soybean and corn in succession, as follows: no inoculation in both crops, inoculation with B. japonicum onto soybean and with A. brasilense onto corn, and reinoculation with B. japonicum + A. brasilense onto soybean and with A. brasilense onto corn. In both crop years, the highest corn yields are observed in clayey soil with seeds reinoculated with A. brasilense. The annual reinoculation with A. brasilense results in a higher corn grain yield in the intercropping with U. ruziziensis in the clayey soil. Inoculation and reinoculation reduce corn yield losses caused by the competition with U. ruziziensis in intercropping.

The effect of tree row location was evaluated for its impact on soil enzyme activities and Biolog substrate use patterns. Soils were sampled to a depth of 30 cm at the tree row and at the middle of the alley at two sites: a 21-year-old pecan (Carya illinoinensis)/bluegrass (Poa trivials) intercrop (Pecan site) and a 12-year-old silver maple (Acer saccharinum)/soybean (Glycine max)-maize (Zea mays) rotation (Maple site). Sampling was done in fall 2001 and summer 2002. beta-Glucosidase activities, Biolog patterns expressed as average well color (AWC), substrate richness, and Shannon diversity index, and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the tree row than at the middle of the alley for surface soils at the Pecan site. Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolytic activity was also higher at the tree row for soils sampled in the fall, but did not differ significantly for soils sampled in the summer. At the Maple site, AWC and substrate richness were significantly higher at the tree row for soils sampled in 2001. Soil volumetric water content and temperature were generally lower in the tree row at the Maple site. The results of this study suggest that functionally different microbial populations may be present under pecan trees compared to cropped alleys which may promote disparities in nutrient availability necessitating differential long-term nutrient management in such alley cropping systems.

Emphasis is being placed on improved cropping systems to address the interrelated problems of Striga and soil fertility decline. The potential benefits of intercropping were investigated at two sites representing different environments for crop yield improvement, soil fertility maintenance and Striga control. Ten food legume and oilseed crop species were compared in inter-row arrangement with sorghum under non-fertilized conditions. In most cases, there was no significant negative impact of intercropping on sorghum growth and development. Among the intercrops, two cowpea varieties - cv. TVU 1977 OD and cv. Blackeye bean - produced the highest supplemental yield of up to 329 and 623 kg ha(-1) grain and 608 and 1173 kg ha(-1) biomass at Adibakel and Sheraro respectively. Treatment differences on Striga infestation and measured soil fertility indicators were not significant. Nevertheless, valuable grain and biomass obtained from the legume intercrops, without seriously compromising sorghum yield, could offer multiple benefits as a source of protein, additional income, feeds for animals and manure in the subsistence agriculture regions of northern Ethiopia.

In order to investigate the changes of yield and yield components of three cultivars of berseem clover as cover crops intercropped with forage corn in different levels of nitrogen starter fertilizer, an experiment was conducted in 2010, at Research Farm, Faculty of Agriculture, Islamic Azad University, Khorasgan Branch (Isfahan). A factorial layout within randomized complete block design with 3 replications was used. Cultivars were Karaj, Sacromont and Multicut, and nitrogen levels included 0,40 and 60 kg/ha. The nitrogen fertilizer was provided from urea source (46% pure N). Berssem cultivars were cultivated between rows of forage corn. Cultivar had significant effect on plant height, nitrate and phosphorus content. Nitrogen fertilizer had significant influence on plant height, total fresh yield, nitrate and phosphorus content. Nitrate and phosphorus content were significantly influenced by interaction between cultivar and nitrogen. The highest plant height, total fresh yield, phosphorus and potassium content were related to Multicut. The maximum nitrate content was also obtained by Multicut, but the highest protein and organic matter was related to Karaj. The highest plant height, total fresh yield, phosphorus and potassium content were related to Multicut. The maximum nitrate content was also obtained by Multicut, but the highest protein and organic matter content was related to Karaj. The maximum plant height, total fresh yield, total dry yield, protein content and potassium percentage were related to application of 60 kg N/ha. The highest nitrate content was also obtained by this treatment. The maximum phosphorus percentage and organic matter content were related to application 40 kg N/ha and no application of nitrogen fertilizer, respectively, but we can use 40 kg N/ha instead of 60 kg N/ha in low input farming system to reduce cost and nitrate content in plant.

Effects of some integrated management options on parthenium interference in sorghum	WEED BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						"atrazine; cowpea intercropping; parthenium; sorghum; weed; wheat straw"	"GRAIN-SORGHUM; HYSTEROPHORUS; MAIZE"	"Parthenium is widely distributed across the uncropped areas of the tropics. It has slowly encroached into many crops and causes considerable yield loss. It heavily infests sorghum, which is widely cultivated by the resource-poor farmers in Africa and Asia. Its interference and management in sorghum in these cropping systems is not well understood. Therefore, this experiment was undertaken to determine the appropriate parthenium management techniques to use in sorghum crops. All the studied weeds, in combination with parthenium, offered greater competition to sorghum than parthenium alone. Similarly, under a composite stand of weeds, parthenium was inferior in competitiveness to the other weeds until 60 days after sowing (DAS); by 90 DAS, it could accumulate a higher dry weight due to its consistent growth. A pre-emergence treatment of atrazine (0.75 kg ha-1) with wheat straw mulch (5.0 t ha-1) brought about a consistent and significant reduction in the parthenium growth and, consequently, increased the sorghum yield by 90.8%. Cowpea intercropping with and without pendimethalin (1.0 kg ha-1) as a pre-emergence treatment could not control parthenium between 0 and 60 DAS, but could reduce the parthenium growth during the later period of 60-90 DAS, which resulted in a significant increase in sorghum growth. These intercropping treatments increased the sorghum grain yield by 156.2% and 142.4%, respectively, over the unweeded control and by 18.5% and 12.1%, respectively, over the weed-free control. These treatments also promoted a higher uptake of N, P, and K by the sorghum crop. Thus, cowpea intercropping was the most effective method for parthenium management vis-a-vis sorghum yield improvement, followed by cowpea intercropping with pendimethalin and then by atrazine as a pre-emergence treatment with wheat straw mulch."

Field experiments were conducted in the Polo Regional Extremo Oeste- APTA, in Andradina -Sao Paulo State, in 2005 and 2006. The objective was to evaluate the performance of common bean cultivars grown in single crop and intercropped with green corn. The randomized blocks design with 9 treatments constituted by the combination of three common bean cultivars of different growth habits: IPR Colibri (Type I), IPR Juriti (Type II) and IAC Carioca (Type III), and two corn cultivars: CATIVERDE 02 (variety) and XB 7012 (hybrid), with four repetitions was used. The intercropping influenced the performance of all common bean cultivars. The green corn CATIVERDE 02 is more appropriate for intercropping with common bean. IAC Carioca, IPR Juriti and IPR Colibri cultivars present same behavior. IPR Colibri presented potential for intercropping.

The aim was to investigate the effects of planting Al-Hassawi clover between sugar beet rows in two intercropping systems: 1 sugar beet row: 2 clover rows (1:2) and 1 sugar beet row: 3 clover rows (1:3) besides sugar beet monocrop and Al-Hassawi clover monocrop. Also, number of harvested cuts from clover during the sugar beet growing season (1, 2 and 3 cuts) on sugar beet yield, sucrose yield, clover yield, leaf area index and land equivalent ratio (LER) were investigated. No significant differences were found between sugar beet fresh root or sucrose yield/ha under the intercropping systems 1:2, 1:3 or sugar beet sole crop with one or two cuts from clover. Fresh forage yield/ha from clover significantly increased as number of cuts increased using the two intercropping systems. The highest clover forage yield/ha was produced from the clover sole with three cuts. The highest LER was produced under the 1:3 intercropping system with two cuts or one cut of clover.

The main objective of this paper is to identify an eco-farming system suitable for saline?alkaline lands via emergetic and cosmic exergybased ecological assessments. Three ecosystems were compared: an agriculture-free system, a local agricultural system, and a superior agricultural system. In the latter two systems, crops (winter wheat and summer maize), animal husbandry and orchards were integrated in raised fields. In the superior agricultural system, conservation tillage, intercropping, and farming-grazing system were used. After 15 years, the electrical conductivity of the soil in 0?30 cm depth was 49.2% reduced using the raised field. In 2018, the average soil electrical conductivity of the superior agricultural system was 20.1% and 14.8% lower than that of the agricultural-free system and local agricultural system, respectively. The superior agricultural system was more sustainable than both the agriculture-free system and the local agricultural system by the footprint investment per unit of footprint delivered method. The renewability and sustainability of the superior agricultural system were higher than the other systems. The economic benefit of the superior agricultural system was the highest among the three systems, which is 1.34 times higher than that of the local agricultural system. These results suggest that the superior agricultural system is better than the other two systems because it promotes the flow of materials and energy and takes advantage of the mutually beneficial effects by using conservation tillage, intercropping, and farming-grazing system. This study contributes to the theoretical foundation for policymaking in saline?alkaline regions worldwide.

Relay Cropping with Tef (Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter) in Additive Design in the Highlands of Northwest Ethiopia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article							"MAIZE; YIELD; COMPETITION; INTERCROPS"	Agronomic strategies such as choosing the optimal row ratio and planting legume crops at the right time are crucial for enhancing crop productivity. A field experiment was conducted in 2016 and 2017 to assess the influence of plant density and lupine intercropping time on tef field productivity. The treatments were as follows: tef was planted at a 20 cm inter-row spacing, lupine was sown at 20 and 40 cm inter-row spacing (row ratio of 1 tef: 1 lupine and 2 tef: 1 lupine) and lupine intercropped three times (1, 2, and 3 weeks after tef planting). Randomized complete block design (RCBD) with 3 replications were used. Two sole tef and lupine were planted. The results revealed 40 cm inter-row spacing and delayed lupine intercropping (3 weeks after tef planting) provided the maximum tef grain yield of 1.80 t ha(-1). The sole cropping of lupine produced the highest lupine grain yield (2.63 t ha(-1)). Lupine intercropping at 40 cm inter-row spacing and two weeks after tef planting resulted in the highest land equivalent ratio (1.54), tef equivalent yield (2.45 t ha(-1)), area time equivalent ratio (1.11), system productivity index (2.5), monetary advantage index (15206 birr ha(-1)), net benefit (65109 birr ha(-1)), and marginal rate of return (602%). Therefore, farmers in the northwest Ethiopian highlands should consider intercropping lupine two weeks after tef planting in-between two rows of tef as an effective intercropping system.

However, a low red/far-red (R/Fr) ratio of light is a signal that affects plant growth in intercropping and close- planting systems. Thus, the low R/Fr ratio uncoupling from shading conditions was assessed to identify the effect of light quality on photosynthesis and CO2 assimilation. Soybean plants were grown in a growth chamber with natural solar radiation under four treatments, that is, normal (N, sunlight), N+Fr, Low (L)+Fr, and L light.ResultsLow R/Fr ratio significantly increased the total biomass, leaf area, starch and sucrose contents, chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate, and quantum efficiency of the photosystem II compared with normal R/Fr ratio under the same light level (P<0.05). Proteomic analysis of soybean leaves under different treatments was performed to quantify the changes in photosynthesis and CO2 assimilation in the chloroplast. Among the 7834 proteins quantified, 12 showed a>1.3-fold change in abundance, of which 1 was related to porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, 2 were involved in photosystem I (PS I), 4 were associated with PS II, 3 proteins participated in photosynthetic electron transport, and 2 were involved in starch and sucrose metabolism. The dynamic change in these proteins indicates that photosynthesis and CO2 assimilation were maintained in the L treatment by up-regulating the component protein levels compared with those in N treatment. Although low R/Fr ratio increased the photosynthetic CO2 assimilation parameters, the differences in most protein expression levels in N+Fr and L+Fr treatments compared with those in N treatment were insignificant. Similar trends were found in gene expression through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction excluding the gene expression of sucrose synthase possible because light environment is one of the factors affecting carbon assimilation.ConclusionsLow R/Fr ratio (high Fr light) can increase the photosynthetic CO2 assimilation in the same light intensity by improving the photosynthetic efficiency of the photosystems.

Above-ground crop residue was greater when corn was intercropped with Tanzania grass (10.7 Mg ha(-1)), Marandu (10.1 Mg ha(-1)), and Ruzi Grass (9.8 Mg ha(-1)) than when corn was not intercropped (4.0 Mg ha(-1)). The intercropped treatments increased the percentage of soil surface covered with crop residue. Soybean and corn grain yields were higher after sole ruzi grass and intercropped ruzi grass than after other crops. The intercropping corn with Brachiaria spp. and corn with Panicum spp. increases above-ground crop residue production and maintains nutrients in the soil without reducing late-season corn yield and the viability of no-till in the midwestern region of Brazil."

The two components of mixtures were sown 50% each. A four-replicate randomised complete block design was used with 50 m(2) plots. The results were compared to the mixtures of spring oats and vetch; and spring oats and pea, respectively. The green matter of fall sown crops was cut by scythe late May, whereas that of spring crops early June. Data demonstrate that the green forage yield and protein production of fall sown oats as a monocrop and intercropped with vetch was higher than those of spring types. Green matter and dry matter yield varied with season, and were more advantageous in the year 2004, when there was more precipitation. The crude protein content of winter vetch and the crude protein production of the mixture fall sown oats + winter vetch were the highest. The mixtures with winter or spring pea yielded less green matter and, as a matter of fact, less crude protein. The fodder mixtures cereals - legumes are conventionally and widely used as feed for livestock in North-America, and the results of our two-year experiment suggest that their use should be intensified in Hungary as well, mainly in the provisional feeding of ruminants. To date, oat varieties with reliable winter hardiness are offered for fall sowing."	"[Palagyi, A.; Salamon, K.

Replanting with Atriplex spp. (salt-bush) is recommended for rehabilitation; but, for land already ploughed, growing barley between atriplex hedges may be the best compromise, providing complementary feed sources and soil protection against wind erosion. The trial described here measured the biomass output of barley and atriplex browse material in a range of treatments, in which hedge dimensions and crop-strip widths were varied in partial factorial combination. Results over 6 years showed little interaction between hedges and barley crop, but growing the two together tended to buffer total feed output against annual fluctuations due to rainfall variability. An apparent decline in atriplex vigour towards the end of the study period drew attention to the need to optimize browsing pressure on the shrubs. Altogether, the indications are that barley-atriplex systems have potential to provide sustainable production in currently degraded steppe areas, but essential conditions for success will be full control of land access and skilled management of atriplex shrubs."

Merr.] or cotton [Gossypium hirsutum L.] into standing wheat [Triticum aestivum L.] allows for earlier planting of the summer crop than with sequential doublecrop systems. Relay intercropping has been evaluated using modifications of standard planting and harvesting equipment as well as specifically designed equipment. In most relay intercropping systems, wheat is drilled in the fall in a row pattern that provides traffic-tire lanes as guides for planting the summer crop. Also, row spacing for wheat in relay intercropping is usually wider than for conventionally planted wheat. This held study, conducted during 1991-1992 and 1992-1993 near Blackville, SC, on a Varina loamy sand (clayey, kaolinitic, thermic Plinthic Paleudults), compared the yield and yield component response of soft red winter wheat produced with two different intercropping production schemes to the yield and yield component response of conventionally planted wheat. Yields of wheat planted in skip-row schemes designed to allow for relay intercropping of either soybean or cotton were not significantly different from yield of conventionally planted wheat under the given experimental conditions. For conventionally planted wheat, wheel traffic on certain rows reduced yields by as much as 50% compared with nontraffic rows. In the schemes designed to allow for relay intercropping, wheat grown with wider-spaced rows (0.31-0.61 m) compensated with respect to yield on an area basis compared with wheat grown with conventionally spaced rows (0.15-0.20 m).

Merr.] allows for earlier soybean planting than in conventional doublecropping systems, but shading and other influences of the wheat crop may be detrimental to intercropped soybean development. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of relay intercropping on soybean growth and yield. Intercropped soybean, planted 19 (1989) or 14 (1990) days before wheat harvest, was compared with a control treatment (same no-till planting pattern and date, but no wheat) on a Cecil sandy loam (clayey, kaolinic, thermic Typic Hapludults) soil. Intercropping had a greater influence on soybean growth in 1989, when there was more shading by the wheat canopy and also when the period between soybean planting and wheat harvest was longer, than in 1990. In both years, the greatest effects of intercropping on growth occurred early in the season, when intercropped plants were taller but had smaller stem diameters, less leaf area, and less aboveground dry weight, as compared with control plants. Photosynthetic rates of upper canopy leaves were reduced by intercropping for 2 wk after wheat harvest in 1990. This was associated with an increase in specific leaf area in intercropped plants. Late-season growth, including that of reproductive parts, was similar for intercropped and control treatments, and there were no detectable effects of intercropping on final yield components or yield in either year. In environments where the period of overlap between the wheat and soybean crops is relatively short, negative effects of relay intercropping on early soybean growth may not result in yield reductions.

Efficient land water management practice and cropping system for increasing water and crop productivity in semi-arid tropics	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							"WIDESPREAD DEFICIENCIES; NATURAL-RESOURCES; JATROPHA-CURCAS; SOIL QUALITY; CONSERVATION; ZINC; L.; VERTISOLS; MOISTURE; SULFUR"	In Indian semi-arid tropics (SATs), low water and crop productivity in Vertisols and associated soils are mainly due to poor land management and erratic and low rainfall occurrence. This study was conducted from 2014 to 2016 at the ICRISAT in India to test the effect of broad bed furrows (BBF) as land water management against conventional flatbed planting for improving soil water content (SWC) and water and crop productivity of three cropping systems: sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]-chickpea (Cicer arientinum L.) and maize (Zea mays)-groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) as sequential and pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.)] + pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] as intercropping, grown under different nutrients management involving macronutrients (N, P, and K) only and combined application of macro- and micronutrients. The results stated that the SWC in BBF was higher over flatbed by 9.35-10.44% in 0- to 0.3-m, 4.56-9.30% in 0.3- to 0.6-m and 3.85-5.26% in 0.6- to 1.05-m soil depths during the cropping season. Moreover, depletion of the soil water through plant uptake was higher in BBF than in flatbed. Among the cropping systems, sorghum-chickpea was the best in bringing highest system equivalent yield and water productivity with the combined application of macro- and micronutrients. The BBF minimized water stress at critical crop growth stages leading to increase crop yield and water productivity in SATs. Thus, BBF along with the application of macro- and micronutrients could be an adaptation strategy to mitigate erratic rainfall due to climate change in SATs.

Initial experiments involved observational row trials with simultaneous planting/seeding of both tomato and trap crops in exploded blocks. One row of these crops was raised on either side and parallel to 10 and 15 rows of tomato respectively. Results indicated that use of African tall variety of marigold cv. Golden Age afforded maximum reduction of both eggs and larvae of H. armigera in the intercropped tomato with a consequent reduction in the number of bored fruits. The rest of the crops were ineffective because they were less preferred and also because flowering in these crops did not synchronize with tomato. Based on the success in observational row trials, systematic studies involving planting combinations of 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20 rows of tomato were evaluated with one row of marigold planted on either side and parallel to each of these combinations. Intercropped tomato was not sprayed until harvest. The percent of fruits damaged in 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20 intercropped rows of tomato were 6.0, 7.1, 10.3, 10.4, 14.1 and 14.5 respectively. Control plots recorded 56.1% fruit borer damage. Later studies involved evaluation of one row of marigold raised on either side and parallel to 14 and 16-rows of tomato. During this experiment, two sprays with 0.07% endosulfan were superimposed on the intercropped tomato and less than 6% fruit borer damage was recorded.

This study aims to analyze the body of Traditional Agroecological Knowledge (TAK) of Nahuatl indigenous community of Ocotal Texizapan, Tatahuicapan, Veracruz, to understand the strategies practiced to achieve food security. Participatory observation and semi-structured and in-depth interviews at the household level (n = 20 families) revealed that Traditional Agroecological Knowledge and local life strategies are linked to the milpa (traditional agroecosystem), home gardening, gathering, hunting and fishing activities which are key components to achieve food security at the family level. Rain-fed and tapachole (residual humidity) milpa, based on sowing maize intercropped with several crops, are closely-related to direct empirical knowledge, the rational use of available natural resources, family labour, and local knowledge. Currently, changes in land use and the use of agrochemicals are increasing in the study community and depleting biodiversity affecting food security at the family level: a situation that endorses the importance of traditional agriculture (milpa), backyard livestock (hens, ducks, pigs) together with gathering, hunting and fishing among the Nahuatl families.

Growth, Yield and Nutritional Performance of Sweet Sorghum and Legumes in Sole and Intercropping Influenced by Type of Legume, Nitrogen Level and Air Quality	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES			English	Article						"air pollutants; energy; food ingredients; intercropping; nitrogen"	"WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; LEAF-AREA; PRODUCTIVITY; MAIZE; CROP; CULTIVARS; SAVANNA; BIOFUEL; OZONE"	Sweet sorghum is a drought-tolerant cereal widely grown as pure stand in water-scarce areas. In the context of ongoing climate change, some agronomic adjustments are required for sustainable food production. Intercropping sweet sorghum with mungbean and soybean was assessed under three N levels (30, 60, 120 kg ha(-1)) and two types of air quality environments (charcoal filtered air and ambient air). Grain yield of sweet sorghum was significantly (P=0.001) reduced in intercropping with mungbean (4.5 t ha(-1)), but remained on par (P>0.05) between sole cropping (5.1 t ha(-1)) and intercropping with soybean (5.1 t ha(-1)). Nitrogen application at 60 kg ha-1 optimized the grain yield, LER (1.8-1.9) and nutritional outputs of carbohydrate, protein, fat, and energy in intercropping (4.7 t, 1.0 t, 0.2 t, and 102.5 MJ ha(-1), respectively) compared to that in sole cropping of sweet sorghum (3.6 t, 0.5 t, 0.1 t, and 74.6 MJ ha(-1), respectively). Charcoal-filtered air with reduced air pollutants of O-3, NO2 and SO2 significantly (P=0.05) improved the growth and seed yield of intercropped mungbean (2.1 tha(-1)) and soybean (1.8 tha(-1)), and overall land productivity compared to ambient air (1.7 and 1.2 t ha(-1), respectively).

The four cropping systems were cotton monoculture (CM), winter wheat intercropped with cotton (WIC), wheat cropping followed by transplanted cotton (WTC) and direct-seeded cotton after winter wheat harvest (WDC). The CF calculated per unit area (CFa), yield (CFy), biomass (CFb) and economic output (CFe) increased in the order CM < WIC < WTC < WDC in the low-fertility plot and WIC < WTC < WDC < CM in the high-fertility plot. The results indicated that CM was the best cropping system in the low-fertility plot and presented CFa, CFy, CFb and CFe values of 4848.14 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1) a(-1), 0.41 kg CO(2)eq kg(-1) a(-1), 0.17 kg CO(2)eq kg(-1) a(-1) and 0.06 kg CO(2)eq yen a(-1), respectively, whereas WIC was the cropping system with the lowest CFs in the high-fertility plot and presented CFa, CFy, CFb and CFe values of 14,410.70 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1) a(-1), 1.31 kg CO(2)eq kg(-1)a(-1), 0.53 kg CO(2)eq kg(-1) a(-1) and 0.34 kg CO(2)eq yen (-1)a(-1), respectively. Thus, it can be concluded that improving cropping systems provides a good option for reducing CF and consequently mitigating climate change.

We established a field study in southwestern Michigan between 2011 and 2014 to compare the effects of rye-vetch spatial arrangement and tillage on soil N, soil moisture, sweet corn (Zea mays L.) above-and belowground biomass, and root morphology. The experiment consisted of a 2 x 2 factorial with two levels of rye-vetch spatial arrangement: segregated into strips (SEG) and full-width mixture (MIX), and two levels of tillage: strip-tillage (ST) or full-width tillage (FWT). Strip-tillage reduced soil inorganic N compared to FWT in 2 out of 3 yr, but increased soil moisture and sweet corn shoot biomass in 2 out of 3 yr. Segregating rye and vetch into strips increased inorganic N within the crop row, but had minimal impact on sweet corn biomass or yield. In contrast, sweet corn roots were responsive to relatively small changes in the distribution of soil N or moisture resulting from strip-tillage and segregated plantings. Strip-tillage and strip-intercropping show promise in adapting reduced-till systems for organic production, but future research should evaluate the response of other crops, and adjustments in cover crop species and termination methods to help optimize these practices."

The effects of inoculum pressure, plot size, fertiliser level and germplasm on mixture efficacy were investigated. In the four trials where inoculum pressure was controlled, mixtures reduced infection more at lower inoculum pressures, but this did not translate into yield benefit. Smaller plots increased mildew in monocultures but not mixtures. Fertiliser levels increased mildew levels but did not affect mixture efficacy. There were large differences between both Polish and UK germplasm, and between Polish and UK trial sites, but the performance of the mixtures compared with their respective monoculture components was similar within both germplasm groups and trial sites. Mixtures reduced lodging and affected plant height and heading date. The advantages of mixtures for improving yield, reducing fungicide applications and improving agronomic characteristics was demonstrated and there seems to be great potential for their further improvement and exploitation.

This study evaluated plant survival, foliar health, and dry matter yields of two alfalfa varieties when established in corn sown at populations ranging from about 47,500 to 100,000 plants per ha(-1) and when treated with prohexadione (PHD), PHD followed by fungicide and insecticide (PHD-FI), or not treated with agrichemicals. The plant density of alfalfa during establishment was adversely impacted by above average precipitation and high corn populations, but substantially improved by PHD-FI treatment, which limited alfalfa etiolation, disease, and defoliation. First-cut dry-matter yields of interseeded alfalfa after corn were maximized at a stand density of approximately 200 plants m(-2) or 850 stems m(-2) and total first year yield exceeded conventionally spring-seeded alfalfa by 59 to 75%. Overall, our results indicated that PHD-FI treatment promoted good establishment and subsequent forage production of interseeded alfalfa. Applications of PHD-FI must, however, be fine-tuned, and additional management practices must be developed to ensure both good yields of corn silage and reliable establishment of interseeded alfalfa, especially during wet growing conditions.

Complementary use of resource in diverse communities can enhance community productivity through optimal use of plant-available resources and positive interactions such as facilitation can ameliorate high abiotic stress conditions. We studied the effects on physiological response, leaf traits and water use efficiency of a multifunctional species intercropping system consisting of peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai], okra [Abelmoschus esculentus (L.) Moench], cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.], and pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) planted alone or in various intercropping combinations in a low fertilizer input system in the peak of summer heat in Texas. Differences in gas exchange measurements were detected only in watermelon in year 2 of the study when okra was the dominant crop. This same year watermelon specific leaf area (SLA) was significantly higher when okra was present in a treatment and particularly in the three and four species combinations, W-pwo and W-pwoc, 27.5 and 31.0 m(2) kg(-1), respectively, as compared to watermelon grown in monoculture, strip intercropped with peanut (S-pw) and within row inter cropped with peanut (W-pw), 20.4, 20.1, and 19.8 m(2) kg(-1), respectively. This corresponds with an increase watermelon leaf N concentration and a decrease in leaf C:N ratio in W-pwo and W-pwoc treatments. No differences in d(13)C composition, a measure of water use efficiency over the leaf lifespan, were detected across cropping system for each species. Water use efficiency based on per plant production (WUEyield) indicated an increase in water use efficiency in dominant crops such as watermelon in 2011 and okra in 2012, but a reduction in WUEyield subordinate crops such as cowpea and pepper both years of the study. Peanut grown in monoculture and strip intercropped with watermelon had significantly lower leaf water potential values in 2012, -2.2 and -2.1 MPa, respectively, as compared to intercropping systems increasing in level of integration (W-pw = -1.1, W-pwo = -0.6, W-pwoc = -1.3, W-all = -1.1 MPa), indicating peanut benefited from alterations to microclimate and facilitative interactions with companion crops in some intercropping systems through a reduction in plant water stress. The results from this study suggest there may be a benefit to a multifunctional intercropping system in the form of increased food production per unit of water input in dominant crops and reduced water stress for some component species. This is important to producers; showing a method to increase overall crop production without increasing water inputs."

A factorial layout within randomized complete block design with 3 replications was used. Cultivars were Karaj, Sacromont and Multicut, and nitrogen levels were 0,40 and 60 kg/ha. The nitrogen fertilizer was provided from urea source (46% pure N). The effect of cultivar was significant on total corn fresh and dry yield, R of clover (yield of clover in intercropping/yield of clover in single cropping), RYT and LER. Total clover fresh yield, total corn fresh yield, R of clover, RYT and LER was significantly influenced by nitrogen fertilizer. Cultivar and nitrogen interaction had significant effect on total corn fresh and dry yield, R of clover, RYT and LER. The highest total fresh and dry yield of corn yield was obtained in forage corn intercropped by Sacromont and Multicut, respectively. These two parameter significantly increased from application of N 0 to 60 kg/ha. In all intercropping treatments, land equivalent ratios (LER) were well above 1, indicating yield advantages for intercropping. The highest LER and RYT in intercropping of forage corn was observed in Sacromont. There were no significant differences in corn organic matter between cultivar treatments and nitrogen treatments. In central of Iran and on the basis of low input farming system, cultivation of berseem clover cultivar intercropped by forage corn can be introduced to development of sustainable food production systems.

Several species have been identified as promising for the sub-humid tropical areas of eastern Africa having bi-modal rainfall. Most of these can be intercropped with species used for food and/or have alternative uses for food, forage or weed suppression. We compared five annual legumes for fixation of atmospheric nitrogen, soil water uptake, soil P and nitrate recovery, effects on subsequent crops and for phosphorus recovery from Busumbu P rock. Canavalia [Canavalia ensiformis (L.) DC] produced the most biomass, fixed the most N, was most efficient in extraction of soil nitrate, and supplied the most N to subsequent food crops. Not unexpectedly, it was also most effective in improving soil productivity. Mucuna [Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC var. utilis] produced less biomass than canavalia but derived a greater proportion of plant N from the atmosphere, while crotalaria [Crotalaria ochroleuca G. Don.] and lablab [Lablab purpureus (L.) cv. Rongai] fixed little nitrogen. Lablab and soybean [Glycine max (L.)] produced the least biomass. All legumes and food crops failed to acquire significant amounts of P from Busumbu soft rock on this moderately acidic soil. The ratios of C:P in the legume biomass were high enough to cause an early net immobilization of P. Profile soil water status was highest under soybean and lowest under canavalia, reflecting differences in biomass production by the legumes and the subsequent maize-bean intercrop. Surface soil water was similar for all species, but differences were evident at depth. All legumes except soybean extracted water below 1.3-m depth. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Status of exotic and previously common native coccinellids (Coleoptera) in South Dakota landscapes	JOURNAL OF THE KANSAS ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						"Harmonia axyridis; Scymnus kansanus; Adalia bipunctata; Coccinella transversoguttata richardsoni; Coccinella novemnotata; invasive species"	"HARMONIA-AXYRIDIS PALLAS; ASIAN LADY BEETLE; INTRAGUILD PREDATION; FIELD OBSERVATIONS; NORTH-AMERICA; UNITED-STATES; INVASION; ESTABLISHMENT; EASTERN; KEY"	In the last two decades, three previously common coccinellids (Adalia bipunetata (L.), Coccinella transversoguttata richardsoni Brown, and Coccinella novemnotata Herbst) have declined in abundance in South Dakota, while two invasive species (Coccinella septempunctata (L.) and Harmonics axyridis (Papas)) have become established there. The objectives of this study were to survey coccinellids in various habitats in South Dakota to better characterize the current coccinellid fauna, determine the extent of exploitation by invasive coccinellids, and possibly identify refuge habitats of previously common coccinellid species. Overall, 2827 coccinellids, comprising 23 species, were collected on yellow sticky traps in field and woody habitats and during timed visual searches in field crops. Adalia bipunctata was found during additional sampling in Butte County in western South Dakota. However, it was not present in samples from eastern and central parts of the state, which is consistent with previous findings that this species is absent from those areas. Coccinella transversoguttata richardsoni and C. novemnotata were absent at all sites sampled. Scymnus kansanus Casey was collected for the first time in South Dakota among arboreal habitats. Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) expanded its geographic range into central South Dakota by 2002 and western South Dakota by 2004. Invasiveness of H. axyridis and C. septempunctata was evident by their presence in a wide variety of habitats surveyed, dominance of larval coccinellid assemblages, and predation upon non-target species of aphids. Harmonia axyridis was the most abundant larval coccinellid in maize and C. septempunctata was the most abundant larval coccinellid in intercropped wheat-alfalfa. Harmonia axyridis preyed upon Stegophylla guercicola (Monell), Aphis nerii Boyer de Fonscolombe, and Aphis asclepiadis Fitch in the field. Both H. axyridis and C. septempunctata preyed upon Hyalopterus pruni (Geoffroy) in the field.

Intercropping with Bidens species increased the biomass and chlorophyll b content of Z. acidojujuba seedlings compared with monoculture, but decreased their carotenoid content. Intercropping with Bidens species also improved the activity of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase in Z. acidojujuba seedlings compared with monoculture. Intercropping with Bidens species decreased the Cd content in the roots of Z. acidojujuba seedlings compared with monoculture. Conversely, when intercropped with B. pilosa, B. biternata, and B. parviflora, the Cd content in the shoots of Z. acidojujuba seedlings increased by 62.18%, 60.10%, and 62.18%, respectively, compared with that of those monocultured. When intercropped with Z. acidojujuba seedlings, the Cd accumulation amount of three Bidens species plants were ranked B. parviflora > B. biternata > B. pilosa. Therefore, intercropping with plants of three Bidens species is not suitable for Cd-contaminated jujube orchards.

Multi-Criteria Assessment of the Economic and Environmental Sustainability Characteristics of Intermediate Wheatgrass Grown as a Dual-Purpose Grain and Forage Crop	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						"Kernza(R) perennial grain; enterprise budgets; energy analysis; greenhouse gas emissions; emergy evaluation"	"GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; ENERGY USE; SYSTEMS; YIELD; TRADEOFFS; MAIZE; FOOD; SOIL"	"Kernza(R) intermediate wheatgrass [IWG; Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & Dewey] is a novel perennial cool-season grass that is being bred for use as a dual-purpose grain and forage crop. The environmental benefits of perennial agriculture have motivated the development of IWG cropping systems and markets for perennial grain food products made with Kernza, but the economic viability and environmental impact of IWG remain uncertain. In this study, we compared three-year cycles of five organic grain production systems: an IWG monoculture, IWG intercropped with medium red clover, a continuous winter wheat monoculture, a wheat-red clover intercrop, and a corn-soybean-spelt rotation. Economic and environmental impacts of each cropping system were assessed using enterprise budgets, energy use, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and emergy indices as indicators. Grain and biomass yields and values for production inputs used in these analyses were obtained from experimental data and management records from two separate field experiments conducted in New York State, USA. Grain yield of IWG averaged 478 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) over three years, equaling approximately 17% of winter wheat grain yield (2807 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) over the same period. In contrast, total forage harvested averaged 6438 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) from the IWG systems, approximately 160% that of the wheat systems (4024 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)). Low grain yield of IWG greatly impacted economic indicators, with break-even farm gate prices for Kernza grain calculated to be 23% greater than the current price of organic winter wheat in New York. Energy use and GHG emissions from the IWG systems were similar to the annual systems when allocated per hectare of production area but were much greater when allocated per kg of grain produced and much lower when allocated per kg of biomass harvested inclusive of hay and straw. Emergy sustainability indices were favorable for the IWG systems due to lower estimated soil erosion and fewer external inputs over the three-year crop cycle. The results show that the sustainability of IWG production is highly dependent on how the hay or straw co-product is used and the extent to which external inputs can be substituted with locally available renewable resources. Integrated crop-livestock systems appear to be a viable scenario for the adoption of IWG as a dual-use perennial grain and forage crop."

Accumulation and transportation of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) in waxy sorghum were investigated. The results showed that the row ratio configurations had significant effects on the N, P, and K accumulation and transportation of waxy sorghum. On the one hand, compared to SW treatment, intercropping treatments showed higher N, P, and K contents and accumulation amounts, N, P, and K transportation amounts before anthesis, N, P, and K transportation rates before anthesis, and contribution rates of N, P, and K transportation before anthesis to the grain of each organ in waxy sorghum. Similarly, the waxy sorghum-soybean intercropping system increased the yield components (including spike length, grain number per spike, and 1,000-grain weight) of waxy sorghum. In addition, the yields of waxy sorghum and soybean among all treatments were in the sequence of SW (SS) > 2W1S > 3W1S > 3W2S > 3W3S > 2W2S. Besides, the 2W1S treatment showed the highest land equivalent ratio and economic benefit. On the whole, the waxy sorghum-soybean intercropping system can increase the N, P, and K absorption among organs and promote the N, P, and K transportation from vegetative organs to grain in waxy sorghum so as to promote the growth and development of spike in waxy sorghum to obtain higher land equivalent ratio and economic benefits. The 2W1S treatment was recommended as the optimal row ratio configuration of the waxy sorghum-soybean system to achieve the maximum utilization of nutrient resources.

However, relay intercropping of full-season cotton and wheat, the most commonly adopted mode, is labor-intensive and unconducive to mechanization. The direct sowing of short-season cotton after wheat (CAW) has been successful, but cotton yields and economic benefits are greatly reduced. Whether the relay intercropping of short-season cotton before the wheat harvest increases cotton yields remains unclear, as does the earliness and fiber quality relative to those for CAW. Therefore, we directly planted short-season cotton after wheat harvest on 15 June (CAW) as the control and interplanted short-season cotton in wheat on 15 May (S1), 25 May (S2) and 5 June (S3), which were 30, 20 and 10 days prior to wheat harvest, respectively, from 2016 to 2018. The crop growth, yield, yield components, boll distribution, and earliness of the cotton were evaluated. The yields and earliness of short-season cotton under relay intercropping were 26.7-30.6% and 20.4-42.9% higher than those under CAW, respectively. Compared with CAW, relay intercropping treatments increased the boll density, boll weight and lint percentage by 5.6-13.1%, 12.5-24.5% and 5.8-12.7%, respectively. The dry matter accumulation and harvest index under the relay intercropping treatments were also greater than those under CAW, which might be attributed to the greater partitioning of dry matter to the seed cotton than to the boll shells. Among the relay intercropping treatments (S1, S2 and S3), the lint yield did not differ, but S1 and S2 were considerably better than S3 based on earliness and fiber quality. The analysis of the within-plant spatial boll distribution showed that more bolls were formed on the lower to middle fruiting branches and at the first fruiting sites for S1 and S2 than for S3 and CAW. Therefore, the increased earliness and fiber quality induced through early relay intercropping (S1 and S2) could be attributed to an improved spatial boll distribution compared to late relay intercropping (S3) or CAW. Conclusively, compared to late relay intercropping and CAW, early relay intercropping considerably increased the lint yield, fiber quality, and earliness by improving the yield components, boll distribution, and dry matter accumulation and partitioning.

J	"Liu, Y; Ma, WQ; He, HL; Wang, ZT; Cao, YH"				"Liu, Yue; Ma, Wenqing; He, Hongliang; Wang, Ziting; Cao, Yanhong"			Effects of Sugarcane and Soybean Intercropping on the Nitrogen-Fixing Bacterial Community in the Rhizosphere	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						"sugarcane; nitrogen-fixing bacteria; intercropping; network analysis; rhizosphere"	"SOIL MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; ROOT; DIVERSITY; PRODUCTIVITY; EMISSIONS; DRIVERS; TRAITS; SHAPE; PGPR; REAL"	Intercropping between sugarcane and soybean is widely used to increase crop yield and promote the sustainable development of the sugarcane industry. However, our understanding of the soil microenvironment in intercropping systems, especially the effect of crop varieties on rhizosphere soil bacterial communities, remains poor. We selected two excellent sugarcane cultivars, Zhongzhe1 (ZZ1) and Zhongzhe9 (ZZ9), from Guangxi and the local soybean variety GUIZAO2 from Guangxi for field interplanting experiments. These two cultivars of sugarcane have good drought resistance. Rhizosphere soil samples were collected from the two intercropping systems to measure physicochemical properties and soil enzyme activities and to extract total soil DNA for high-throughput sequencing. We found that the diversity of the rhizosphere bacterial community was significantly different between the two intercropping systems. Compared with ZZ1, the ZZ9 intercropping system enriched the nitrogen-fixing bacteria, increasing the available nitrogen content by 18% compared with that with ZZ1. In addition, ZZ9 intercropping with soybean formed a more compact rhizosphere environment than ZZ1, thus providing favorable conditions for sugarcane growth. These results provide guidance for the sugarcane industry, especially for the management of sugarcane and soybean intercropping in Guangxi, China.

Can intercropping be an adaptation to drought?

Our objectives were firstly to evaluate the crop model APSIM for pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.))-cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp) intercropping-and secondly to investigate the hypothesis that intercropping provides complimentary yield under drought conditions. The APSIM model was evaluated against data from a two year on station field experiment during the dry season of a semi-arid environment in Patancheru, India, with severe, partial and no water deficit stress (well-watered); densities of 17 and 33 plants per m(-2), and intercrop and sole crop production of pearl millet and cowpea. Overall, APSIM captured the dynamics of grain yields, indicated by the Willmott Index of Agreement (IA: 1 optimal, 0 the worst) 0.91 from 36 data points (n), total biomass (IA: 0.90, n = 144), leaf area index (LAI, IA = 0.77, n = 66), plant height (IA 0.96, n = 104 pearl millet) and cowpea (IA 0.81, n = 102), as well as soil water (IA 0.73, n = 126). Model accuracy was reasonable in absolute terms (RMSE pearl millet 469 kg/ha and cowpea 322 kg/ha). However, due to low observed values (observed mean yield pearl millet 1,280 kg/ha and cowpea 555 kg/ha), the relative error was high, a known aspect for simulation accuracy in low-yielding environments. The simulation experiment compared the effect of intercropping pearl millet and cowpea versus sole cropping under different plant densities and water supplies. A key finding was that intercropping pearl millet and cowpea resulted in similar total yields to the sole pearl millet. Both sole and intercrop systems responded strongly to increasing water supply, except sole cropped cowpea, which performed relatively better under low water supply. High plant density had a consistent effect, leading to lower yields under low water supply. Higher yields were achieved under high density, but only when water supply was high: absolute highest total intercrop yields were 4,000 (high density) and 3,500 kg/ha (low density). This confirms the suitability of the common practice among farmers who use the low planting density under water scarce conditions. Overall, this study confirms that intercropping is no silver bullet, i.e. not per se a way to achieve high yield production or reduce risk under drought. It does, however, provide an opportunity to diversify food production by additionally integrating protein rich crops, such as cowpea."	"[Nelson, William C.

A nested design was used, with the first factor of oil palm age group consisting of open land and land under oil palm stands aged 4, 5, and 8 years. The second factor was the reflective mulch that included land without mulch, land with inorganic reflective mulch, and land with organic reflective mulch. The use of reflective mulch in the soybean-oil palm intercropping system was able to increase the reflection intensity of surface solar radiation, as well as increase the soybean solar radiation interception. The use of inorganic and organic reflective mulch significantly increased the leaf area, specific leaf weight, and soybean stomatal density. Organic reflective mulch led to significant reductions in the amount of chlorophyll A and B content. The photosynthetic rate of soybean in lower leaves was increased significantly. Inorganic reflective mulch resulted in significant reductions in the rate of transpiration, intercellular CO2 concentration, and conductance of soybean stomata in lower leaves. The use of reflective mulch contributed to improved soybean performance under oil palm stands. The use of organic reflective mulch for soybean grown under oil palm stands aged up to 5 years resulted in better growth rates due to the increased intensity of solar radiation reflected from the surface. However, the reflection effect could not meet the needs of soybean solar radiation on land under oil palm stands aged >5 years due to the very low transmission. Therefore, the use of organic reflective mulch is more effective and efficient in the soybean-oil palm intercropping system until the oil palm reaches the age of 5 years.

In this study, we selected three aromatic plants (Ocimum basilicum, Tr1; Satureja hortensis, Tr2; Ageratum houstonianum, Tr3) as intercrops that separately grew between rows of pear trees, and no plants were grown as the control in a pear orchard during the spring-summer season for 3 years. The soil from each plot was collected using a stainless-steel corer by five-point sampling between rows of pear trees. The bacterial and fungal communities of the different aromatic intercrops were analyzed by 16S and ITS rRNA gene amplicon sequencing; their functional profiles were predicted by PICRUSt and FUNGuild analyses. The root exudates of the aromatic plants were analyzed by a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) system. Compared with the control treatment, all intercropping treatments with aromatic plants significantly increased SOM and soil water content and decreased pH values. The contents of total nitrogen and alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen in Tr1 and Tr2 were higher than those in Tr3. In Tr3 soil, the relative content of saccharides increased little, whereas the changes in amine (increases) and alcohols (decreases) were rapid. Ageratum houstonianum intercropping decreased the microbial community diversity and significantly influenced the relative abundances of the dominant microbiota (Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Gemmatimonadetes, Cyanobacteria, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota) at the phylum, class, and order levels, which increased the assemblage of functional groups (nitrite ammonification, nitrate ammonification, and ureolysis groups). Our study suggested that the main root exudates from aromatic plants shaped the microbial diversity, structure, and functional groups related to the N cycle during SOM mineralization and that intercropping with aromatic plants (especially basil and summer savory) increased N release in the orchard soil."

Inoculation effects with selected bacteria were investigated firstly on fenugreek plants under greenhouse experiment and secondly on intercropped fenugreek and barley under three different agro-environmental conditions for two consecutive years. Sinorhizobium meliloti F42 was selected due to its ability to nodulate fenugreek and effectively improve plant growth. Among non-nodulating endophytic bacteria, Variovorax paradoxus F310 strain was selected regarding its plant growth-promoting traits showed in vitro and confirmed in vivo under greenhouse experiment. Field inoculation trials revealed a significant improvement in fenugreek nodulation (up to + 97%) as well as in soil enzymes activities (up to + 209%), shoot N content (up to + 18%), shoot dry weight (up to + 40%), photosynthetic assimilation (up to + 34%) and chlorophyll content of both intercropped plants in response to the mono-inoculation with Sinorhizobium meliloti F42, compared to the un-inoculated treatment at the SBR and JBS sites. Variovorax paradoxus F310 inoculation significantly increased shoot P content of both intercropped plants at the three experimental sites compared to the un-inoculated treatment (up to + 48%). It was shown that bacterial inoculation was more efficient at the low-rainfall region than the high-rainfall region. The co-inoculation with Sinorhizobium meliloti F42 and Variovorax paradoxus F310 resulted in a significant reduction in fenugreek nodulation and shoot N content. This survey showed the benefits of rhizobial and PGPR inoculation as efficient bio-inoculums to promote the cereal-legume intercropping system and highlights the influence of site-specific environmental factors on Rhizobium-PGPR-plant interactions.

Altering N rate exerted limited effect on the studied sunflower and soybean forage parameters. Dry matter (DM) content of sunflower (157.14 g kg(-1)) and crude protein (CP) content of sunflower (120.48 g kg(-1)) and soybean (162.49 g kg(-1)) were significantly increased, while soybean NDF content significantly decreased, with increasing the N rate. The effect of age at forage removal was more pronounced as it is a direct reflection to the crop's stage of maturity at cutting. Older sunflower and soybean plants were characterized by higher herbage yield, DM and fiber contents, yet lower CP than younger plants. Maximum herbage yield achieved with late cutting of sunflower and soybean amounted to 9.82 and 10.81 t ha(-1), respectively. Relative feed value of sunflower and soybean herbage was less stable in response to the variations in the studied treatments, while, relative forage quality resulting from all treatments was graded as premium, making them suitable for high-producing dairy cows and young calves in intensive dairy production systems."

Merrill) intercropping with reduced nitrogen input influences rhizosphere phosphorus dynamics and phosphorus acquisition of sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum)	BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS			English	Article						"Cereal-legume intercrop; Phosphorus fractionation; Acid phosphomonoesterase; Phosphorus-use efficiency; Low nitrogen application"	"PHOSPHATASE-ACTIVITY; ORGANIC PHOSPHORUS; USE EFFICIENCY; SOIL; FIXATION; LEGUME; PRODUCTIVITY; L.; AVAILABILITY; DEPLETION"	Reducing nitrogen (N) input can improve crop productivity in cereal-legume intercrops, but the impact on phosphorus (P) acquisition is unclear. A 10-year (2009-2018) field experiment was conducted to quantify how P acquisition by sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) was affected by intercropping with soybean (Glycine max(L.) Merrill at 1:1 and 1:2) with two N inputs (300 kg ha(-1)[reduced], 525 kg ha(-1)[conventional]). Nitrogen was supplied only to the sugarcane crop, and soybean received no N. There was a significantly higher land-equivalent ratio of sugarcane-soybean intercropping than of the sole cropping, and the intercropping advantage was more pronounced under reduced N input which can be associated with high degree of complementary N use. Furthermore, soybean intercropping with reduced N input stimulated acid phosphomonoesterase activity and depleted organic P in the rhizosphere of sugarcane, resulting in increased sugarcane stem P concentration and system P-use efficiency. The interspecific facilitation of P acquisition could be associated with the increased symbiotic N(2)fixation in soybean, soil microbial biomass and activity under reduced N input. In conclusion, soybean intercropping with reduced N input to sugarcane enhanced rhizosphere enzymatic organic P transformation and sugarcane P acquisition, which may contribute to maintaining a sustainable sugarcane production under low N supply. The findings advance our understanding of interactions between N and P cycling and provide new evidence for the value of cereal-legume intercrops in reducing fertilizer input.

Additive intercropping of sunflower and soybean to improve yield and land use efficiency: Effect of thinning interval and nitrogen fertilization	CHILEAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						"Helianthus annuus; Glycine max; intercropping; land use efficiency; thinning"		An additive intercropping model was adopted to improve land use efficiency and productivity of two prominent oil crops grown in Egypt, that is, sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) and soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) A 2-yr field trial was conducted in Northern Egypt during the summers of 2017 and 2018. The effects on yield, crop components, and land use efficiency of the system were tested with three N fertilizer rates (70, 105, and 140 kg N ha(-1)) and three thinning intervals of 15, 30, and 45 d after sowing (DAS) for sunflower and 30, 45, and 60 DAS for soybean. Late thinning increased plant height in both crops, but reduced sunflower stem and head diameters and seed weight per head. The maximum seed yield occurred in the pure stands and reached 4.00 and 1.61 t ha(-1) for sunflower and soybean, respectively. Early thinning positively affected seed yield and fresh and dry biological yields, while the effect of N rates was limited. Seed oil content of both crops was slightly affected by the treatments and generally averaged approximately 50% and 20% in sunflower and soybean, respectively. While the land equivalent ratio (LER) indicated the advantage of intercropping sunflower and soybean (LER > 1), the DM equivalent ratio (DMER) provided a more realistic estimate as to the effect of intercropping compared with sole cropping in an additive model. Early and intermediate thinning intervals across all N fertilizer rates resulted in yield gain (DMER > 1), while late thinning reduced yield (DMER < 1). Intercropping sunflower and soybean crops is recommended for low input farming systems, particularly in developing countries.

The experiment included two factors, the first was cultivation type (intercropping with spinach and monoculture) for two cultivars of pea (Joff and Anward) which symbolized (J,A) respectively and treatments of intercropping were symbolized (JS, AS). The second factor was foliar spraying with three levels of yeast extract (0,5,10 g/l) symbolized (Y0, Y5, Y10). The results showed the superiority of the treatment Y5 (5 mg. l(-1)) which gave the highest values for all studied characters except branch number. Also the results showed that the highest values were noticed for the treatment JY5 for leaves number 26.87 leaf.plant(-1), pod number 24.03 pod.plant(-1) and plant yield 177.00 g.plant(-1) and the treatment AY5 referred to decrease days number until 50% of flowering to 110.10, pod weight 7.57 g.pod(-1), seed number per pod 7.13 seed.pod(-1) and percentage of protein 24.80% while treatments of intercropping showed that the growth and yield parameters of pea cultivars when planted alone were higher as compared with their intercropping with spinach.

A two-year field experiment was undertaken to investigate the effect of agricultural management practices on the trigonelline content, antioxidant activity measured with DPPH (2,2-Diphenyl-1-Picrylhydrazyl) and FRAP (Fe+++-Reduction, Ferric reducing antioxidant power), total phenolic content, total flavonoids content, and specific flavonoid contents of fenugreek seeds. The treatments examined were sole fenugreek (Sole F) and three intercropping ratios with buckwheat (B) (F:B = 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2), each with three types of fertilizer (chemical fertilizer, integrated fertilizer, and broiler litter). The highest trigonelline content of fenugreek seeds was obtained in F:B = 2:1 fertilized with broiler litter. Compared to Sole F, the fenugreek seeds harvested in the intercropped treatments had higher antioxidant activity, total phenolic content, vitexin, isovitexin, orientin, and isoorientin. The treatment F:B = 2:1 enhanced the antioxidant activity and the content of bioactive compounds. Overall, the addition of organic manure to fenugreek seeds was highly effective at promoting all compounds analyzed in both the sole and the intercrop systems. Our study found that harvested fenugreek seeds from plants that were intercropped with buckwheat and with the application of organic fertilizer enhanced the seed content of antioxidants and flavonoids.

Corn silage is an important feed for intense ruminant production, but the growth of corn relies heavily on the use of chemical fertilizers. Sustainable crop production requires careful management of all nutrient sources available on a farm, particularly in corn-based cropping systems. Methods. Experiments were conducted to determine the appropriate technique of corn-legume intercropping in conjunction with the supplemental use of chemical fertilizers, organic manure, and biofertilizers (BFs). Acetylene reduction assays (ARAs) were also performed on corn and soybean roots. Results. Combining chemical fertilizers with chicken manure (CM) in a 50:50 ratio and applying 50% NPK+50% CM+BF produced fresh forage and dry matter (DM) yields that were similar to those produced in the 100% nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) treatment. Among the lone fertilizer treatments, the inorganic fertilizer (100% NPK) treatment produced the highest DM yield (13.86 t/ha) of forage and outyielded the 100% CM (9.74 t/ha) treatment. However, when CM was combined with NPK, the resulting DM yield of forage (13.86 t/ha) was the same as that resulting from 100% NPK (13.68 t/ha). Compared with CM applications alone, combinations of NPK and CM applications resulted in increased plant height, crop growth rates (CGRs) and leaf area index (LAI), but the values of these parameters were similar to those resulting from 100% NPK application. Fertilizers in which the ratio was 50% CM+50% NPK or 50% CM+50% NPK+BF resulted in protein yields that were similar to those resulting from conventional fertilizers. Similarly, the CP content did not significantly differ between applications of the 100% NPK and 50% CM+50% NPK fertilizers. The use of BFs had no significant impact on improving either the yield or quality of forage fertilized with inorganic or organic fertilizer. Lactic acid responded differently to different fertilizer applications and was significantly higher in the fertilized plots than in the unfertilized plots. Compared with treatments of lone chemical and lone organic manure fertilizers, treatments involving applications of BF and a combination of BF and NPK or CM resulted in higher ARA values. Discussion. There is no simple and easy approach to increase biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in grain legumes grown as part of a cropping system under realistic farm field conditions. Overall, evidence recorded from this study proves that, compared with corn monocrops combined with CM and chemical fertilizers, corn-soybean intercrops could increase forage yields and quality, produce higher total protein yields, and reduce the need for protein supplements and chemical fertilizers.

Results showed that the first aphid was seen in the last week of January while the predator population was first recorded during the first week of March. Aphid population was maximum on wheat monoculture when 130 specimens were recorded per tiller. Among strip cropping garlic showed maximum population (113 per tiller) followed by brassica (105), berseem (98) and alfalfa (83 per tiller). Second week of March was the most favorable period when 11.48 per tiller of aphid population counted in wheat monoculture, while no specimens were noticed after the first week of April. The coccinellid and syrphid fly showed a maximum population of 1.3 and 1.1 per plant in wheat monoculture respectively in the third week of March, The garlic (1.1/plant) and brassica (0.8/plant) showed maximum population while minimum population of coccinellid recorded in berseem (0.6 per plant) and alfalfa (0.5 per plant).

Our previous studies indicated that intercropping of peanut with the Chinese medicinal herb, Atracviodes lancea effectively suppressed soil-borne peanut diseases, resulting in increased peanut yields. However, the underlying mechanism is unknown. In this study, the below ground effects of A. lancea on both fungal and bacterial communities in the peanut rhizosphere were investigated using pyrosequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) and 16S rRNA gene amplicons, respectively. Closed cultivation systems were constructed to investigate the role of volatiles and exudates originating from rhizomes and roots of A. lancea on fungal and bacterial communities. Intercropping with A. lancea significantly altered fungal community composition in the peanut rhizosphere, coinciding with decline of Fusarium root rot and improvement of peanut growth. Volatiles originating from A. lancea rhizome material had more effects on ftmgal communities than on bacterial communities, and significantly suppressed F. oxysporum growth. Root exudates of A. lancea had no apparent inhibitory effect on F. oxysporum. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis revealed 21 volatiles originating from A. lancea rhizome material and terpenes and aromatic hydrocarbons were the most common types. Our results suggest that A. lancea suppressed pathogenic Fusarium populations by means of volatiles from the rhizome. Our results support the idea that intercropping with A. lancea or use of its effective components has a strong potential for managing soil-borne ftmgal diseases.

Studies on Intercropping Soybean with Sugar cane under Different Nitrogen Levels	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"Tntercropping; N levels; Sugar cane; Soybean"	"ECONOMIC BENEFIT; QUALITY; YIELD"	TWO experiments were conducted at Mallawy Agric. Res. Station, Minia Governorate, Egypt during 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 seasons to study the effect of intercropping soybean with sugar cane under different levels of N fertilizer. A split plot design with four replicates was used for both experiments. Main plots were devoted for N levels i.e.195, 210 and 225kg fad(-1) of nitrogen. The intercropping patterns of soybean as 100 % sugarcane+30% soybean in one row, 100% sugarcane + 30% soybean in two rows, 100% sugarcane + 40 % soybean in one row, 100 % sugarcane + 40 % soybean in two rows, pure stand of sugar cane and soybean were distributed in sub-plots. Nitrogen levels had significant effect on most studied characters of soybean. Increasing N levels up to 225kg fad(-1) increased all studied traits of yield and yield components of soybean. The highest values of yield and yield components were produced from pure stand compared to intercropping patterns. On the other hand, intercropping pattern of 100% sugar cane+40% soybean in one row gave the highest seed yield. Increasing N level up to 225 kg fad(-1) caused significant differences on yield and its components of sugar cane as well as quality parameters and sugar yield fad(-1).The highest sugar yield fad(-1) was gained from 225kgf ad(-1)of nitrogen. Intercropping patterns of soybean on sugar cane had a significant effect on studied characters of sugar cane. 100% sugar cane+40% soybean in one row (2 plants hill(-1)) gave the highest values. In general, pure stand of sugar cane gave the highest values of juice quality and sugar yield fad(-1).The value of Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) is greater than one, which indicates the increasing land productivity per unit area. The highest value of LER (1.56) was obtained by intercropping 40 % soybean in one row (2 plants hill(-1)) on 100% sugar cane with 225kg fad(-1). Aggressivity (Agg) values of sugar cane were positive dominant, while those of soybean were negative dominated intercropping 40 % soybean on 100% sugar cane with 225 kg N fad(-1). The actual yield loss (AYL) values for sugar cane and soybean were positive at all patterns intercropping. The highest values of total income and profit obtained from 100 % sugar cane + 40 % soybean in one row (2 plants hill(-1)) with 225kg fad(-1) of nitrogen.	"[Morsy, A. S.

J	"Shah, MA; Farooq, M; Hussain, M"				"Shah, Muhammad Asghar; Farooq, Muhammad; Hussain, Mubshar"			Productivity and profitability of cotton-wheat system as influenced by relay intercropping of insect resistant transgenic cotton in bed planted wheat	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"Cropping system; Economic analysis; Intercropping; Planting methods"	"ROOT DEVELOPMENT; YIELD"	"Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is the leading cash crop being grown across the globe including Pakistan. By the inclusion of insect resistant transgenic cotton (BT cotton), the cotton production has mounted many folds in Pakistan. BT cotton is mostly grown in Southern Punjab in cotton-wheat cropping system of Pakistan; however there exists a time conflict among wheat harvest and BT cotton sowing in this system. Wheat is harvested during late April but the ideal sowing time of BT cotton is early-mid March indicating a time conflict of 4-6 weeks which is becoming the main concern leading to wheat exclusion from this system. Intercropping of BT cotton in standing wheat is one of the possible options to manage this overlapping period. This two year field study was, therefore, conducted at two locations (Multan, Vehari) to evaluate the economic feasibility of relay intercropping of BT cotton through different sowing methods in BT cotton-wheat cropping system. BT cotton-wheat cropping systems included in the study were: conventionally tilled cotton (CTC) on fallow land during early and late March, CTC during late April after harvest of flat sown wheat (FSW), bed sown wheat (BSW)+ intercropped cotton during early and late March, and ridge sown wheat (RSW)+ intercropped cotton during early and late March. Planting cotton in fallow land with conventional tillage during early March had more seed cotton yield; whereas planting in the same way during April after wheat harvest had minimum seed cotton yield. Likewise, FSW had more yield than ridge and bed sown wheat with intercropped BT cotton during early or late March. However, the system productivity in terms of net income, benefit: cost ratio and marginal rate of return of BSW + intercropped BT cotton during early March was the highest during both years at both locations. However, the system with sole crop of BT cotton sown on fallow land during late or early March was the least economical even than the system with CTC during late April after harvest of FSW. In conclusion, BSW+ intercropped cotton during early March may be opted to manage the time conflict and improve the economic productivity of BT cotton-wheat cropping system without wheat exclusion from the system.

A randomized block experimental design was used with four replications; treatments were in a 2 x 4 factorial arrangement with two systems of crop management: second-crop corn intercropped with Urochloa brizantha, and monoculture of second crop corn; and four forms of topdressing N: urea, urea + ammonium sulfate, ammonium sulfate, and no N supply. The following chemical properties were evaluated: soil organic matter and exchangeable K contents, cation exchange capacity, base saturation, and K saturation; as well as the physical properties: soil bulk density and aggregate stability. Crop residue cover and agronomic traits of soybean were also assessed. Intercropping induced significant differences in crop residue cover, plant height, soybean yield, stand, 100-seed weight, soil organic matter, exchangeable K, and K saturation in the exchange complex. There was no significant effect of the crop sequences on soil bulk density and mean weight and geometric mean diameter of water-stable aggregates.

Intercropped plants showed minimal differences in volume densities (Vv) of stem tissues and forage chemical composition compared to sole crops. The proportions of lignin and NDF (Neutral Detergent Fiber) positively correlated with xylem Vv. The proportions of ADF (Acid Detergent Fiber), cellulose and ash in intercropped plants were increased or decreased mostly by less than 10% compared to those in pure stands. The Anatomical Equivalent Ratio (AER) defined as the ratio based on anatomical quality-determining parameters, can assist in the evaluation of the benefits of specific intercropping systems. Intercropping of the legume species studied in this work, especially L. albus with V. sativa, showed encouraging results from anatomical perspective since it would not cause a decline of forage quality.

Among different time of plantings tested, 13th December planting has recorded the highest disease severity and minimum grain yield. It was also noticed that planting geometry i.e. row spacing has significant influence on disease severity. The minimum disease severity was recorded in plots having wider row spacing (45 cm) followed by 37.5 and 30 cm. Similarly, minimum rust severity was recorded when field pea was intercropped with mustard. However, planting direction has not significantly influenced rust severity under Pantnagar (Uttaralchand) condition.

Our objectives were to evaluate: (1) planting date effects on seed yield and nutrient concentration of an early-maturing, no-till system (NTS) soybean (Glycine max) when intercropped with palisade grass (Brachiaria brizantha); (2) dry matter production and protein concentration of the grass pasture after soybean harvest; and (3) overall revenue and LUE for the intercrop system. Experiments were performed during two growing seasons in Botucatu, Brazil using a randomized complete block experimental design. When palisade grass and soybean were sown simultaneously, soybean yield averaged 3.28 Mg ha(-1). Similar seed yields were observed when palisade grass was planted either 30 d after soybean emergence (DAE) (3.29 Mg ha(-1)) or at the soybean reproductive stage R6 (full seed) (3.50 Mg ha(-1)). Monocrop soybean yield averaged 3.50 Mg ha(-1). First cut dry matter forage production was greater when palisade grass was sown at the same time as soybean or 30 DAE of soybean. This indicates that interseeding palisade grass with soybean does not significantly affect soybean nutrition or yield. Intercropping did increase LUE and resulted in 1.6 times more revenue than soybean alone. However, sowing palisade grass at the soybean reproductive stage R6 (full seed) significantly reduced the forage yield compared to early planting. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The aim of this study was to evaluate shoot dry matter production, decomposition rate and macronutrient and silicon release from pigeonpea and pearl millet in monoculture and intercropping systems. A randomized block design was used with a 3 x 6 factorial arrangement, with four replications. The first factor consisted of three cover crops (pigeonpea, pearl millet and intercropping of these cover crops) and the second consisted of six sampling times [0, 18, 32, 46, 74 and 91 days after desiccation (DAD)]. Pearl millet produced greater amounts of shoot dry matter and content of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, C and Si and had a higher decomposition rate and macronutrient and Si release than the other cover crops. The rates of decomposition and daily nutrient release from shoot dry matter were highest in the first period of evaluation (0-18 DAD). Over time, the C/N, C/P and C/S ratios increased, while C/Si and the decomposition rate decreased. Potassium was the nutrient most quickly released to the soil, especially from pearl millet residue. Silicon had the lowest release rate, with 62, 82 and 74 % of the total content in the shoot dry matter remaining in the last evaluation of pearl millet, pigeonpea and in the intercrop system, respectively. The shoot dry matter from the intercrop system had a different decomposition rate than that from the pearl millet monoculture and pigeonpea. Plants with greater shoot dry matter production and lower C/Si ratio are more effective in a no-tillage system for providing a more complete and persistent soil cover.

Increased agricultural production through intercropping with minimal cost is need of time to feed increasing population. The reported work evaluates the biological efficiencies and economics of pea, garlic, turnip and cauliflower grown as sole crops and when pea intercropped in garlic, turnip and cauliflower during 2010-12. All the vegetables generally yielded more when grown as single crop compared with when pea was intercropped in these vegetables. In peas in garlic intercropping, pea yield was not significantly affected; however, garlic yield was significantly reduced (65.8%). Pea intercropping in turnip or cauliflower resulted in significantly lower yields of both crops (29.1 and 28.0%, respectively) as compared with their sole cropping. All other characteristics (plant growth and yield components) of all the four crops which indicate biological efficiency generally were greater when grown as single crops and decreased in intercropping combinations. Analysis of intercropping treatments revealed that pea intercropping in turnip resulted in the highest marginal rate of return (8,875%), followed by pea intercropping in cauliflower (6,977%), due to lower input costs incurred per hectare. However, net benefit to the growers was higher (Rs. 327,925) in case of pea intercropping in cauliflower, followed by pea intercropping in garlic (Rs. 213,425)."

Millsp.] intercropping system under rainfed conditions on a sandy loam soil. There was significant superiority in yield attributes as well as yield of pearlmillet and pigeonpea under sole cropping as compared to their intercropping system. Pearlmillet equivalent yield and land equivalent ratio was significantly higher with intercropping system (2:1 ratio). Intercropping system recorded the higher moisture-use-efficiency and economics as compared to either of the sole cropping. Rate of moisture use was more in sole pearlmillet (3.92 mm/day) than sole pigeonpea and intercropping system. The results showed significant improvement in all yield attributes and yield as well as moisture use and economics due to spray of transpiration suppressants over the control under inadequate moisture conditions. The total number of nodule and nitrogenase activity significantly differed in pigeonpea crop under different fertilizer doses as compared to control. Among fertility levels, application of 50 kg N + 17.2 kg P/ha, followed by 25 kg N 8.6 kg P/ha + BF resulted in better performance of crops over other treatments.	"[Ansari, M. A.; Rana, K.

Economic feasibility of different wheat-canola intercropping systems was evaluated by growing hybrid and synthetic canola genotypes as intercrop in wheat. Seven wheat and canola intercropping systems included in the study were 3 rows of wheat + 1 row of hybrid canola, 4 rows of wheat + 2 rows of hybrid canola, 3 rows of wheat + 1 row of synthetic canola, 4 rows of wheat + 2 rows of synthetic canola, wheat sole crop, hybrid canola sole crop and synthetic canola sole crop. Wheat and canola intercropping system with 4 rows of wheat + 2 rows of hybrid canola outperformed with maximum net income, benefit-cost ratio, land equivalent ratio and marginal rate of return compared with all sole and intercrops. However, minimum economic returns and benefit-cost ratios were recorded from sole synthetic canola and its intercrops. Regarding competitive functions, higher values of crowding coefficient and competitive ratio for wheat in all wheat and canola intercropping systems highlighted the dominant behavior of wheat on its companion intercrops. In crux, wheat and canola intercropping with 4 rows of wheat + 2 rows of hybrid canola was more productive and economically profitable than all other inter-and sole crops.

We conducted a study to determine the potential of relay-intercropping for enhancing the abundance of aphidophagous lady beetles in sorghum. A relay-intercropping system consisting of alfalfa, winter wheat, and cotton as intercrops and sorghum as a main crop was compared with sorghum monoculture plots at two study sites in OK from 2003 to 2006. Lady beetles and aphids were sampled throughout the season using sticky traps and field counts on individual sorghum plants. Results from sticky traps and field counts show that differences in abundance and species composition of lady beetles between intercropped and monoculture sorghum were not statistically different during each year of study. Also, the lady beetle-greenbug ratios in relay-intercropped and monoculture plots were not significantly different. Lack of significant effects of relay-intercropping in our study may have been attributable to the confounding effects of spatial and temporal scale and the low number of aphids and other alternative prey in the intercrops compared with high incidence of corn leaf aphids in sorghum early in the season.

Ratoon yield attributes, viz. number of milliable canes, cane weight, cane length and internode/cane followed the trend observed in cane yield. In succeeding wheat crop, treatment of trash burning + green manure incorporation in ratoon also recorded highest crop emergence, number of tillers and plant height at 60 days after sowing. It also recorded the highest and significantly high grain and straw yields of wheat by 15.0 and 15.1% than the trash removal by 19.4 and 19.7% than trash burning and by 12.5 and 19.0% over trash incorporation treatments, respectively. This treatment also indicated highest net returns of Rs 1 30 226/ha from the sequence (sugarcane-ratoon-wheat) and was statistically similar to trash burning + green manure mulch and trash removal + green manure incorporation treatments.

Light interception and utilization in relay intercrops of wheat and cotton	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"leaf are index (LAI); light use efficiency (LUE); photosynthetic active radiation (PAR); intercropping; competition"	"RADIATION-USE EFFICIENCY; SOLAR-RADIATION; SIMPLE-MODEL; RESOURCE USE; ROW CROPS; GROWTH; SYSTEMS; PRODUCTIVITY; TEMPERATURE; ENVIRONMENT"	In China, a large acreage of cultivated land is devoted to relay intercropping of winter wheat and cotton. Wheat is sown in strips with interspersed bare soil in October and harvested in June of the next year, while cotton is sown in the interspersed paths in the wheat crop in April and harvested before the next wheat sowing in October. This paper addresses the question how strip width and number of plant rows per strip of wheat or cotton affect light interception (LI) and light use efficiency (LUE) of both component crops. Field experiments were carried out in three consecutive years: 2002, 2003 and 2004. Light interception and productivity were estimated in monocultures of wheat and cotton and four intercropping designs differing in strip and path width as well as number of rows per strip. The intercrop systems were identified by the number of rows per strip of wheat and cotton, respectively, as 3:1, 3:2, 4:2 and 6:2. Total light interception over a season was calculated from LAI measurements, using a model for light interception in a row crop. The spatial distribution and diurnal course of light in intercrops were also measured with sensors. Wheat monocrops intercepted 618 MJ m(-2) photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) from 18 March to harvest in 2002, 337 MJ m(-2) from 29 April to harvest in 2003, and 457 MJ m(-2) from 13 April to harvest in 2004. Averaged over 3 years, wheat in the four intercrops (3:1, 3:2, 4:2 and 6:2, respectively) intercepted 83, 71, 73 and 75% as much PAR as the sole wheat. From sowing to harvest, cotton monocrops intercepted 491 MJ m(-2) PAR in 2002, 426 MJ m(-2) in 2003, and 415 MJ m(-2) in 2004. Cotton in the four intercrops (3:1, 3:2, 4:2 and 6:2, respectively) intercepted 73, 93, 86 and 67% as much PAR as the sole cotton. LUE of wheat was 2.12 +/- 0.14 g total dry matter MJ(-1) PAR during the reproductive period, while that of cotton was 1.33 +/- 0.02 g dry matter MJ(-1) PAR over the whole growing period. No differences in LUE of wheat or cotton were found between systems. The analysis indicates that the high productivity of intercrops, compared to monocultures, can be fully explained by an increase in accumulated light interception per unit cultivated area. The component crops are thus complementary in their interception of light over space and time. The model results indicate that light interception can be modified by choice of the number of crop rows per strip and strip width. The best distribution of light is attained in systems with narrow strips, a high proportion of border rows, and high planting densities of cotton. Suggestions for system improvement are given.

Four different vetch species, i.e. common (Farukbey-2001), Hungarian (Tarim Beyazi-98), hairy (Selcuklu-2002), and wooly pod (Segmen-2002), intercropped with barley (Tokak-157) were utilized. The mixtures of vetches intercropped with barley were planted on 7 October 2003 (I), 7 November 2003 (II), and 10 April 2004 (III), and each variety/planting time was randomly assigned to 3 replications. The mixtures of vetches intercropped with barley were harvested by hand using clippers when the barley started spiking and vetches were at 1/4 flowering. All samples were analyzed for dry matter (DM), ash, crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) content. In vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) of the samples was also determined. While DM and organic matter (OM) content did not differ, CP, NDF, and AIDE content were significantly different among the different mixtures of vetch intercropped with barley (P < 0.05). IVDMD, metabolizable energy (ME), and net energy lactation (NEL) values were also significantly different among the mixtures of vetch intercropped with barley (P < 0.05). Digestible DM and ME yield of the mixtures were significantly affected by planting time (P < 0.05), but not variety. However, CP yield of the vetch-barley mixtures was significantly affected by both planting time and variety (P < 0.05). It can be concluded that all of the mixtures of vetch intercropped with barley had significantly higher digestible DM and CP yield when planted on 7 October 2003. Thus, October should be preferred for planting of the mixtures of vetch intercropped with barley in Eastern Anatolia. If a greater CP yield in addition to digestible DM yield is desired from vetch-barley hay, then common vetch should not be the choice.	"[Bingol, N. Tugba; Karsli, M.

The formation of seasonal wetlands, which will sustain the water balance of a semiarid environment, was quite unstable depending entirely on the variable rainfall in the upper catchments of Angola. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the use of seasonal wetland water by pearl millet, the local staple food crop intercropped with cowpea, to discuss the water competition pattern of intercropped species. Root system development of the intercropped species was also evaluated together with the water source analysis. For this purpose, field experiments using pearl millet intercropped with cowpea in the seasonal wetland in Namibia University (Exp. 1) and monocropped pearl millet in the local farmers field (Exp. 2) were conducted in northern Namibia. Both pearl millet and cowpea developed deeper root systems as the distance from the seasonal wetland water increased. At flowering time, the 6D value of intercropped cowpea was similar to that of wetland water, while that in pearl millet was much lower than those of both the wetland water and groundwater. This indicated that intercropped pearl millet did not have full access to the wetland water when there was competition with cowpea for water derived from various water sources. Under such circumstances, intercropped pearl millet probably relies more on the rainfall water, which is just sufficient to sustain its growth in a semiarid environment. By contrast, intercropped cowpea wins in the competition with pearl millet and can acquire water from the existing stored wetland water.

The experimental design was a randomized block in a factorial scheme 2x4x4+4 with three replication, consisting of two cutting systems (a single cutting, close to the soil, of both crops at R-5 stage of the soybean, and a two cutting system: the first done 60 days after emergence, at 30 cm from the soil surface and the second after the plants regrowth, close to the soil, at the same time of the cutting of the first system); four soybean cultivars (CAC-1, Conquista, Cristalina and Doko RC) and four hybrids of forage sorghum (AG 2002, AG 2005E, BR 601 and Massa 03). Another contiguous trial was conducted for the respective monoculture of sorghum, being realized the cutting of the plants with grains in mealy stage. In the intercropping, the differents cutting systems showed significant differences in yields, green mass, dry matter and total grude protein. The soybean cultivars (CAC-1 and Conquista) and the sorghum hybrids (AG 2002 and BR 601) were the ones that more stood out.

Glomus clarum did not statistically differ from the control. Soybean shoot dry weight and grain dry weight showed linearly increase with P levels indepedently of mycorhizal fungus inoculation, while dry grain weigth incresed in the same way as that of sorghum Glomus etunicatum was the most efficient mycorhizal fungus among the species at all P levels. The results demonstrate that mycorhizal inoculation contributed substantially to increase shoot and grain dry weight as well as to increase N, P, K, Zn and Cu shoot contents.

Strip-intercropped corn may sustain infestations of corn rootworm larvae attributable to migration of larvae into Ist-yr corn from soil previously planted to corn. Row-specific distribution of corn rootworm eggs and adult emergence were determined in a strip intercropped system, and effects of interstrip cultural and insecticidal treatments on rootworm infestation of outer rows were evaluated. Corn rootworm eggs were found in all rows of strips previously planted to corn. Root injury ratings were significantly higher in the outer rows than in the interior rows of corn adjacent to the previous year's corn strips. Oilseed meal and insecticide treatments were associated with lower corn rootworm adult emergence and larval root injury than was found in untreated plots. Higher rootworm adult emergence and root injury scores in tillage treatments, where the soil was disturbed by ripping with a cultivator shank, were attributed to increased soil pore space that facilitated larval movement into adjacent corn strips. Fewer adults emerged and less root injury occurred in outer rows of corn adjacent to soybean strips that were subjected to interrow soil compaction from wheel traffic. In severely infested fields, deliberate compaction of interrow soil or incorporation of cruciferous plant material into soil between strips are possible noninsecticidal management options for reducing severe corn rootworm infestation of outside rows of corn in strip intercropping systems.

Wheat and wheat-clover mixtures were grown in a low-organic loam soil, earthworms were added at densities comparable to field population densities and the experiments were terminated 48 and 17 d after earthworm introductions. In both experiments, earthworms significantly increased the biomass and N uptake of wheat while they had generally no effects on clover. As a result, earthworm activity increased the proportion of wheat biomass in the total plant biomass of the mixture. Nitrogen budgets of the experiment lasting 48 d indicated that additional N in the system made available by earthworm activity was primarily taken up by the wheat. Earthworms also affected intra-plant N allocation in wheat which had significantly higher shoot:root N ratios when earthworms were present. When clover was labelled with N-15 in the experiment which lasted 17 d, endogeic earthworms significantly reduced the amounts of N-15 excess transferred from living or decomposing clover roots to accompanying wheat plants. Earthworms assimilated small quantities of N-15 tracer from decomposing clover roots but not from living clover roots. The results of these model experiments suggest that earthworms can affect the balance between intercropped cereals and legumes by altering intra- and inter-plant N allocation.

Pendimethalin was the only herbicide that injured common vetch. Pronamide and pronamide plus diuron injured oat by affecting plant emergence. Prevalent weed species were fumitory, henbit, and wild buckwheat. All herbicides provided more than 90% control of fumitory and most herbicides except pronamide provided more than 90% control of henbit relative to the untreated check. Wild buckwheat stands were reduced by isoxaben (68%), linuron (40%), prometryn (69%), pronamide (86%), and pronamide plus diuron (61%). More than 90% control of prostrate knotweed was achieved with isoxaben, pronamide, and terbutryn. Pronamide and pronamide plus diuron reduced forage yields and increased vetch in the forage. The untreated vetch and oat monocrop treatments showed the competitive advantage of oat over vetch and weedy species.

The crops were grown on a sandy loam soil in a spatial arrangement typical of husbandry practices of the region. The soil is characterised by rapid drainage and low water-holding capacity. Results indicate that intercropping cowpea with millet did not increase the water use rate over sole millet as transpiration by cowpea may be substituting for soil evaporation. Root zone water storage after the millet harvest was sufficient to maintain a long duration cowpea cultivar that was able to make use of water that otherwise would have been lost to drainage during the dry season. As there was no evidence of water stress up to millet harvest, intercropping cowpea with millet increased the efficiency of utilisation of rainfall. It is concluded that water supply may not be the most limiting constraint on agricultural production in such conditions. The implications of these findings for agriculture in the region are discussed.

Corn, soybean and watermelon were grown as sole crops and as intercrops in three paired combinations (corn: watermelon, corn: soybean, watermelon: soybean) with three levels of poultry manure (0, 20, 40 t/ha). The crop yields and land equivalent ratios (LERs) were determined for all treatments. The highest yields for the two cropping systems were obtained in response to the highest poultry manure addition. Corn gave the highest yield when intercropped with soybean, where increases in yield of 45 % and 66 % were obtained over those of corn sole crop at the same level of poultry manure (40 t/ha), in 1988 and 1989 seasons, respectively. Soybean gave the highest yield when grown with corn leading to an increase of 35 % and 34 % over soybean sole crop grown at the same level of poultry manure (40 t/ha) in 1988 and 1989, respectively. Watermelon gave the highest yield when grown with soybean, giving an increase which ranged from 390 to 920 kg ha-1 over the yield of sole cropping system under the same level of poultry manure (40 t/ha). The LER values for all intercrop treatments were greater than 1.0 which gave clearly an indication for the superiority of the intercropping over the sole cropping system especially when 40 t ha-1 poultry manure was added.

In two experiments, an alfalfa monoculture and an intercrop (mixture of alfalfa and oat, Avena sativa L.) were evaluated for their potential for reducing leafhopper densities. The 1988 experiment tested the effects of the intercrop and leafhopper control, whereas the 1989 experiment tested the effects of weed control and two oat cultivars differing in stature. Leafhopper density (number per square meter and number per 100 alfalfa stems) and various plant parameters were measured in both experiments. Adult leafhopper densities per square meter were reduced an average of 82.6% in 1988 and 77.3% in 1989, and densities per 100 stems were reduced an average of 64.7% in 1988 and 54.5% in 1989, in the intercrop compared with the alfalfa monoculture. Nymph densities per square meter were reduced an average of 85.5% in 1988 and 89.5% in 1989, and densities per 100 stems were reduced an average of 74.8% in 1988 and 82.7% in 1989, in the intercrop compared with the alfalfa monoculture. The intercrop was characterized as having reduced alfalfa biomass, reduced alfalfa stem density, reduced alfalfa maturity (1989 only), increased alfalfa stem length (1989 only), reduced weed biomass, and increased shading of alfalfa in comparison with alfalfa monoculture. Thus, factors that may cause the observed reduction in leafhopper density may be associated with the host plant or the habitat condition. The study corroborates other studies that have shown reduced potato leafhopper densities in grass-legume mixtures, and suggests that an oat-alfalfa intercrop may reduce the need for responsive tactics for leafhopper management on spring-planted alfalfa compared with the need in alfalfa monoculture.

We investigated the effects of intercropped forage grass on production of corn (Zea mays L.) harvested for silage at 0.20 and 0.45 mheight in the summer, as well as on production of subsequent forage, soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] harvested for silage, nutrient cycling and soil responses on a Typic Haplorthox in Botucatu, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Palisade grass cv. BRS Piata [Urochloa brizantha cv. BRS Piata ] was the introduced companion crop with corn (Years 1 and 2), while signal grass [Urochloa decumbens cv. Basilisk] was the residual weedy species in comparison. Guineagrass cv. Aruana [Megathyrsus maximus cv. Aruana] was the introduced companion crop with soybean (Year 3), with only a residual effect of crop systems from the previous two years. After the corn silage harvest, pasture was grazed by lambs in winter/spring using a semi-feedlot system. When cut at 0.45 m compared with 0.20 m height, corn intercropped with palisade grass had greater leaf nutrient concentration, improved agronomic characteristics, forage mass of pasture for grazing by lambs, greater surface mulch produced, and greater quantity of N, P and K returned to soil. Greater soil organic matter, P, K and Mg concentration, and base saturation in the surface soil depth and lower soil penetration resistance at all depths occurred at 0.45 m than at 0.20 m corn silage cutting height intercropped with palisade grass. Analyzing the system as a whole, harvesting corn silage crop with palisade grass intercrop at 0.45 m height was the most viable option in this integrated crop-livestock system.

A recommended strategy to reduce the effects of soil preparation is to use crop rotation and cover crops that help conserve and restore the soil structure. The aim of this study was to evaluate and quantify the homogeneous morphological units in soil under conventional mechanized tillage and animal traction, as well as to assess the effect on the soil structure of intercropping with jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis L.). Profiles were analyzed in April of 2006, in five counties in the Southern-Central region of Parana State (Brazil), on family farms producing maize (Zea mays L.), sometimes intercropped with jack bean. The current structures in the crop profile were analyzed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and subsequently principal component analysis (PCA) to generate statistics. Morphostructural soil analysis showed a predominance of compact units in areas of high-intensity cultivation under mechanized traction. The cover crop did not improve the structure of the soil with low porosity and compact units that hamper the root system growth. In areas exposed to animal traction, a predominance of cracked units was observed, where roots grew around the clods and along the gaps between them.

Incorporating palisadegrass [Urochloa brizantha (Hochst. Ex A. Rich.) R.D. Webster] [syn. Brachiaria brizantha (Hochst. Ex A.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of growing palisadegrass on soil fertility, plant nutrition, and grain yield of subsequent cash crops in a tropical region. The experiment was performed in southeastern Brazil in plots that were grown for two consecutive growing seasons (2002-2003 and 2003-2004) with either monocropped corn (Zea mays L.) or corn intercropped with palisadegrass. An initial evaluation of soil fertility was performed in November 2004 when the land was either fallow (following monocropped corn) or covered by palisadegrass (intercropped areas). Aft er the preceding treatments, the following crops were cultivated: soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] during the 20042005 and 2005-2006 spring-summer, white oat (Avena sativa L.) during the 2005 and 2006 fall-winter, and corn during the 2006-2007 spring-summer. Intercropping palisadegrass with corn increased the soil fertility compared to monocropped corn. Soybean, white oat, and corn all had higher leaf macronutrient concentrations and grain yields in previously intercropped areas than in monocropped areas. Therefore, the periodic, short-term incorporation of a perennial forage grass, such as palisadegrass, as a cover crop is recommended to increase grain production and to improve the soil fertility of grain-production areas.

Effect of Planting System and Nicosulfuron Doses on Soil Microbial Activity	PLANTA DANINHA			Portuguese	Article						"microbial biomass; respirometry; metabolic quotient"	"BIOMASS; EVOLUTION; CO2"	This study aimed to evaluate the effect of atrazine + nicosulfuron on soil microbial activity, under the conventional and no-tillage systems. The experiment was carried out in an area of maize-brachiaria intercropping, where atrazine + nicosulfuron were applied at (1,500 + 10 and 1,500 + 30 g h(-1)) with a weed-handed area being maintained without prior cultivation and another area without weed control. At flowering, soil samples were collected to determine the rate of CO2 unfastening, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) using the relation between accumulated CO2 and MBC. The rate of CO2 unfastening was lower only in plots without weed control. MBC was higher in the no-tillage system, being negatively affected due to the absence of vegetation. Lower MBC was observed in the weed-handed areas, probably due to the absence of straw. Under no-tillage system conditions, no difference was observed between the soil treatments with herbicide application and those without weed control. It can be concluded that the evaluated microbiological indicators were sensitive to the treatments, showing lower soil disturbance under no-tillage system conditions. However, in crop-livestock integration under the conventional system, the negative herbicide effect increase of nicosulfuron rate.	"[Camelo, G.

In Ethiopia, limited information is available on the population abundance of cowpea nodulating rhizobia. This study aimed to evaluate the population abundance of rhizobia nodulating cowpea and their relation with cropping history and soil properties in cowpea producing areas of Ethiopia. The abundance of rhizobia existing in the soils was assessed by the most probable number technique. The study revealed that the population abundance of rhizobia nodulating cowpea is high, ranging from 3.1 x 10(4) to 1.0 x 10(7) rhizobia cells g(-1) of soil, and the population varied at each location. Besides, there was no statistically significant correlation between soil physicochemical properties and the rhizobial population. All the investigated soils had been cropped with cowpea in monoculture (sole cowpea), intercropping (mostly with sorghum and maize) and crop rotation for many years. Thus, the higher rhizobia population observed in this study is associated with the season factor and cropping history of the areas. In general, the soils of cowpea production areas in Ethiopia harbor adequate levels of rhizobia capable of nodulating cowpea, which are passable to provide satisfactory nitrogen fixation and nodulation.

Integrated pest management: the push-pull approach for controlling insect pests and weeds of cereals, and its potential for other agricultural systems including animal husbandry	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						"push-pull; stem borers; cereals; subsistence farming; cattle pests; disease vectors"	"GLOSSINA-MORSITANS-MORSITANS; MODEL LEGUME; (E)-BETA-OCIMENE SYNTHASE; CHILO-PARTELLUS; HOST LOCATION; TSETSE-FLIES; DIPTERA; ODORS; SEMIOCHEMICALS; EXPRESSION"	This paper describes the 'push-pull' or 'stimulo-deterrent diversionary' strategy in relation to current and potential examples from our own experiences. The push-pull effect is established by exploiting semiochemicals to repel insect pests from the crop ('push') and to attract them into trap crops ('pull'). The systems exemplified here have been developed for subsistence farming in Africa and delivery of the semiochemicals is entirely by companion cropping, i.e. intercropping for the push and trap cropping for the pull. The main target was a series of lepidopterous pests attacking maize and other cereals. Although the area given to the cereal crop itself is reduced under the push-pull system, higher yields are produced per unit area. An important spin-off from the project is that the companion crops are valuable forage for farm animals. Leguminous intercrops also provide advantages with regard to plant nutrition and some of the trap crops help with water retention and in reducing land erosion. A major benefit is that certain intercrop plants provide dramatic control of the African witchweed (striga). Animal husbandry forms an essential part of intensive subsistence agriculture in Africa and developments using analogous push-pull control strategies for insect pests of cattle are exemplified.

We present the results of a discrete choice experiment (DCE) conducted in face-to-face interviews. In a study in Malawi, farmers responded to a series of questions about different cropping techniques and tree planting options to improve soil fertility and climate change resilience. A combination of financial and non-financial incentives was proposed to increase adoption and success rates. The results show that for different policy objectives, different climate smart packages are suitable. Our results demonstrate that farmers prefer options that secure the production of maize and include crops with both domestic use and local markets. The drought-resistant crop sorghum was unpopular among respondents; achieving SDG 13 through this CSA approach would therefore require high incentive payments. If CSA is to help achieve multiple goals e.g. poverty and inequality reduction (SDGs 1 and 10) as well as SDGs 2 and 13, a range of CSA packages, with different types of crops, rotation versus intercropping techniques and incentive levels, should be offered to smallholders."

CRANTZ; FATTY-ACID PROFILE; APPLIED NITROGEN; CROP DIVERSIFICATION; AGRONOMIC EVALUATION; DILUTION CURVE; SOWING DATE; WATER-USE; MANAGEMENT; OIL"	Camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz] is an emerging oilseed crop combining both industrial and agronomic advantages. Camelina seed yield, oil and protein contents, and fatty-acid composition, vary across genotypes, environments, and agricultural practices. However, no studies have been conducted to identify and rank major limiting factors explaining yield and quality variations under on-farm conditions. Camelina performance was measured on 39 experimental strips corresponding to five camelina crop management routes (grown as an intercrop or sole crop), implemented in nine farmers' fields across northern France in 2017 and 2018. The ranking of candidate limiting factors, defined a priori from scientific literature, was carried out using a model mixing method based on the Akaike Information Criterion. Main limiting factors of camelina yield (ranging from 62 to 2585 kg ha(-1)) were nitrogen crop status at flowering stage and downy mildew. Camelina yield was indeed positively correlated with the Nitrogen Nutrition Index at flowering stage (R-2 = 0.44, p = 0.007). Oil content varied from 36.6 to 46.5 % and was negatively correlated with protein content. Main indicators explaining oil content variations were grain filling duration and downy mildew. Both poly-unsaturated and linolenic acid contents were positively correlated to grain filling duration, and negatively correlated to temperature during grain filling period. Camelina nitrogen status at flowering stage was mainly explained by N uptake of the intercropped species (pea or barley), and the amount of available inorganic nitrogen in the soil between sowing and flowering. Downy mildew was influenced by both weather conditions and the amount of weed biomass. This study showed a large variability in camelina seed yield and quality under on-farm conditions. The identification of the major limiting factors made it possible to pinpoint ways of improving camelina performance namely choosing genotypes with high resistance to mildew, better managing nitrogen fertilization or delaying camelina sowing date. Finally we also identified major research topics to be addressed to support the adoption of this new crop by farmers as the elaboration of the critical nitrogen dilution curve.

Two different mixtures were studied: oil-linseed cv. 'Flanders' with grain-peas cv. 'Ramrod' (mixture I) or oil-linseed cv. 'Barbara' with fodder-peas cv. 'Phonix' (mixture II). The cultivars chosen for both mixtures were 'characterized by similar height. In the mixed sowings, a substitutive model was used, with 50% share of each of the components. Growth and productivity of both species and cultivars grown in a pure sowing or mixture depended on the weather conditions during vegetation. Non-typical weather conditions in the vegetative seasons 2005 (wet) and 2006 (dry) resulted in a decreased 1000 seed mass (MTS) of linseed cv. 'Barbara' grown in the mixture, by about 19% and 25%, respectively. Moreover, in 2005 a decreased share of seeds of cv. 'Barbara' in mixture I was stated, as compared with the seed share of cv. 'Flanders' in the mixture II. Edible peas cv. 'Ramrod' grown in the mixture I had reduced the fruiting part of the shoot by about 37%, the lowered number of pods by about 33% and the MTS by about 6%, as compared to its pure sowing. Mutual aggression between the linseed and peas in the mixtures was higher during the seasons of less favorable weather conditions. The significantly higher aggression towards the companion plant in the mixture showed peas cv. 'Ramrod' sown in the mixture I. At the same time, the harvest index value of 'Ramrod' grown in the mixture I was higher by about 15%, as compared to its pure sowing, which was due to using linseed as supporting plants. The mixture II of fodder peas cv. 'Phonix' with linseed cv. 'Barbara', proved to be significantly more reliable, as evidenced by the value of the land equivalent ratio (LER = 1.20).

The behavior of D. busseolae was observed in a diversified habitat that consisted of stemborer host plants (maize, Zea mays L. and sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L). Moench (Poaceae)) and a non-host plant (molasses grass, Melinis minutiflora Beauv. (Poaceae)), while C. sesamiae was observed separately on host plants and molasses grass. In previous olfactometer studies, C. sesamiae was attracted to molasses grass volatiles while D. busseolae was repelled. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of molasses grass on close-range foraging behavior of the parasitoids in an arena that included infested and uninfested host plants. Dentichasmias busseolae strongly discriminated between host and non-host plants, with female wasps spending most of the time on infested host plants and least time on molasses grass. Likewise, C. sesamiae spent more time on uninfested and infested host plants than it did on molasses grass in single choice bioassays. While on infested plants, the wasps spent more time foraging on the stem, the site of damage, than on other areas of the plant. Overall, the results indicate that presence of the non-host plant does not hinder close range foraging activities of either parasitoid.

Three experiments were carried out during 1995 and 1996 by intercropping broccoli either with contrast crops (pea, beans, potato or oats) or with similar crops (cauliflower or cabbage) in additive and substitutive designs at different intercropping rates. The overall intercrop characteristics as leaf area index, soil coverage and biomass yield were not related to a higher yield, and similar results were due to different factors. Land Equivalent Ratios (LER) similar to 1.0 were due either to a high and constant Relative Yield (RY) of the main crop associated with low RY of the secondary crop, or to trade-off between the RY of both associated crops. Similarly, a LER of 1.34 resulted from a reasonable performance of the dominated crop (beans) in the second experiment at the 50% additive design, whereas in the third experiment there was no dominating crop in the broccoli-potato intercropping but the LER reached 1.27. The mechanisms involved in the overyielding were the bean canopy plasticity and its temporal deployment asynchrony when compared with broccoli, allowing reduction of the competition for light, and the crop development temporal asynchrony between broccoli and potato, reducing the competition for production factors.

DC.	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						"Atractylodes lancea (Thunb.) DC.; intercropping; survival; production; volatile oil"	"CROP-ROTATION; MAIZE; SOIL; NEMATODE"	Commercial cultivation of the medicinal plant Atractylodes lancea is significantly restricted by low survival rates and reduced yields. Intercropping can reasonably coordinate interspecific interactions, effectively utilize environmental resources, and increase survival and yield. We conducted a field experiment from 2014 to 2016 to analyze the advantages and effects of intercropping on A. lancea survival, growth traits, individual volatile oil content, and total volatile oil content. In addition to A. lancea monoculture (AL), five intercropping combinations were planted: Zea mays L. (ZM) + A. lancea, Tagetes erecta L. (TE) + A. lancea, Calendula officinalis L. (CO) + A. lancea, Glycine max (Linn.) Merr. (GM) + A. lancea, and Polygonum hydropiper L. (PH) + A. lancea. The survival and average rhizome weight of A. lancea was higher in the ZM, CO, and TE treatments than in the monoculture treatment, and the average plant height was higher in all intercropping treatments than in the monoculture. The volatile oil content of A. lancea from the ZM and CO treatments was significantly improved relative to that of monoculture plants. The volatile oil harvest was higher in the ZM, CO, and TE treatments than in the monoculture. We conclude that intercropping is an effective way to increase the survival and yield of A. lancea. Furthermore, intercropping with ZM, CO, and TE increases the harvest of four volatile oils from A. lancea.

Moench) intercropping system as influenced by okra planting density (0; 14,000; 28,000; 42,000 and 56,000 plants/ha) in intercropping with cassava (10,000 plants/ha) were investigated in 2000/2001 and 2001/2002 cropping seasons at Umudike, a rainforest location in south-eastern Nigeria. The results showed that sole cassava plants were shorter than the intercrops between 6 to 12 weeks after planting (WAP) in 2000/2001 but throughout the growing period (6 - 48 WAP) in 2001/2002 as okra planting density in the mixture increased. Similarly, sole okra plants were shorter than the intercropped ones. The leaf production and the leaf area index (LAI) of okra were reduced by high okra planting densities intercropped with cassava. The LAI of cassava increased up to 36 WAP and thereafter declined while in okra it declined up to 10 WAP in both years. It was always higher in sole okra than in the intercrops. Intercropping reduced the total number of tubers but the tuber yield was not affected. Intercropping significantly (P< 0.05) reduced the number of fresh pods, pod length and diameter, pod weight per plant and pod yield/ha. Within the intercrops, okra pod yield was not affected by okra planting density in 2000/2001 whereas in 2001/2002 season, 42,000 plants/ha okra plots yielded higher than the other intercrops. The results showed that it was more productive to grow the two crops together as depicted by yield advantages of 25-30% and that there was higher monetary returns in the mixtures. The optimum okra planting density for intercropping with cassava was 42,000 plants/ha as it had the highest yield advantage of 30% in both seasons and gross monetary returns of N 142,000.00 and N 153,900.00 in 2000/2001 and 2001/2002 seasons, respectively."

It is well known that the parasitic weed Striga asiatica (L.) Kuntze can be suppressed by Striga-tolerant sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) cultivars, Desmodiwn intortum (Mill.) Urb. (greanleaf desmodium), and by fertilization with nitrogen. The study objective was the assessment of Striga control provided by integration of Desmodium density, timing of sorghum-Desmodium intercrop establishment, and nitrogen fertilization. Growth responses and yield of three sorghum cultivars were measured in three pot experiments. A soil naturally infested with Striga was used, and that part of the soil which served as uninfested control was chemically sterilised. Striga numbers and growth were affected significantly by sorghum cultivars, sorghum-Desmodium intercrop ratios, timing of the sorghum-Desmodium association, as well as by their interactions. Desmodium caused 100% suppression of Striga emergence when Desmodium was established in the 1:3 sorghum-Desmodium ratio at seeding of sorghum. Total control of Striga was also achieved with the 1:1 sorghum-Desmodizim ratio when Desmodium was transplanted 30 days before sorghum seeding. However, these two treatments also caused significant reductions in sorghum yield. In contrast, 100% Striga control and a dramatic increase in sorghum yield were achieved with 100 kg N ha(-1) in the 1:1 sorghum-Desmodium intercrop. Compatibility of sorghum and Desmodium was evident at the 1:1 sorghum-Desmodium intercrop established at sorghum seeding. Overall, the Ethiopian cultivars Meko and Abshir showed better agronomic performance and higher tolerance to Striga than the South African cultivar PAN 8564. It is recommended that the N x Desmodium x sorghum interaction be investigated under field conditions.

Intercropping of Brachiaria species with corn as a second crop increases the mulching in the cropping system. This study aimed to evaluate the weeds infestation in soybeans following corn/forages intercrop, as a function of corn plant structure, forage species and density. Experiments were conducted in a completely randomized blocks design with four replications, in Ponta Pora and Dourados municipalities, Mato Grosso do Sul state, Brazil, in 2010/2011. Treatments consisted of three corn hybrids with distinct plant architectures intercropped with three forage species: Brachiaria ruziziensis, B. brizantha and B. decumbens, at five densities, and the resulting dry mass was maintained throughout the winter. During the following cropping season, forages were desiccated prior to planting soybeans, and the dry mass of weeds, dry mass of the mulching, soil coverage by weeds, and the broadleaf/grass weed species index (WPI) were determined 15 days after soybean emergence, submitted to an F-test, and analyzed either by regression or by multiple mean comparison, according to the nature of the data. When intercropping corn with species of Brachiaria, a reduction in the overall weeds infestation may always be expected; among the studied forage species, more problems with weeds may be anticipated in areas with a less competitive species, e. g. B. ruziziensis. Under the conditions of the trials, B. brizantha and B. decumbens were more capable of inhibiting the emergence of weed species in the winter."	"[Concenco, G.; Ceccon, G.; Fonseca, I.

The increase in plant diversity in Integrated Crop Livestock Systems under no-tillage (ICLS-NT) can also alter the diversity of species of fungi and bring benefits to the system. This study had the objective of evaluating the AMF diversity and its quantitative characteristics in ICLS-NT with intercrop in the pasture phase. The experiment was conducted in a dystrophic red latosol, with plots represented by the grasses Panicum maximun cv. BRS Tamani and Urochloa brizantha cv. Piafa, intercrop with the legumes (subplots): cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) cv. BRS Tumucumaque, pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) cv. BRS Mandarim and single grass type only. The potential for inoculation was elevated in areas with legume intercrop, with either grass, and about 29% higher in areas with the C. cajan/P. maximun consortium. They may be associated with the benefits that the intercrop with legumes brings, through the relationship of rhizobia and AMF. The spore density and mycorrhizal colonization were higher with the use of grass from the genus Urochloa in relation to Panicum, reaching 92% and 88% higher, respectively, as well as an increase in species richness, being associated with a greater affinity of AMF with intercropped grasses. The insertion of the legumes into the intercrop with the grasses affected soybean productivity, positively correlating (74%) with mycorrhizal colonization. These results are related to the fact that intercrop promote the release of a high diversity of organic compounds, helping in the activity of soil microbiota, including AMF, increasing colonization and species diversity of these fungi. Thus, intercrops of grasses with legumes affected positively the activity and diversity of species of the AMF, reflecting in the increase in productivity of the soybean crop.

Four winter crops, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), fababean (Vicia faba) and rapeseed (Brassica napus) and four summer crops, sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), pearl millet (Pennisetum typhoidum L.), pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.) and mungbean (Vigna radiate L.) were grown under two irrigation regimes with the pattern of two crops in each intercropping system, at Agronomy Research Farm, The University of Agriculture, Peshawar, Pakistan in both winter and summer season during 2015-16 to 2016-17. The results showed that higher grain yield (kg ha(-1)) were recorded under sole cropping than intercropping. Higher grain yield was recorded in sole cropping, for all four crops. All crops grown in intercropping produced comparatively higher grains head(-1) and seeds pod(-1) than sole crop except pigeonpea. Intercropping systems were performed different in term of competition indexes which determined land utilization efficiency. Competition indexes revealed that in winter season wheat intercropped with fababean showed highest advantages of intercropping in term of land equivalent ratio (30%), relative crowding co-efficient (60%), actual yield loss (60%), area time equivalent ratio (27%), land utilization efficiency (83%), intercropping advantages (1060), monetary advantage index (Pakistani rupees (PKR) 46456) and system productivity index (3684) while in summer sorghum/pearl millet intercropped with pigeonpea was the most dominant intercropping systems in term of relative crowding co-Efficient (40%), actual yield loss (50%), land utilization efficiency (60%) intercropping advantages (1150) and system productivity index (1914). Aggressivity and competition ratio showed that cereals especially barley in winter and sorghum in summer season was highly competitive crops in the intercropping system. Most of the competition indexes values were higher for winter crops under limited irrigated condition while in case of summer crops intercropping indexes were higher under full irrigated condition. It was concluded that wheat intercropped with fababean, and sorghum/millet intercropped with mung bean was the most successful intercropping systems in winter and summer seasons, respectively under both irrigation regimes, for the semiarid region of Pakistan.

Influence of oat and spring pea mixtures on forage characteristics in different environments	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							"BARLEY-PEA; YIELD; QUALITY; SYSTEM; INTERCROPS; GROWTH; FALLOW; COVER; CROPS; RATES"	Forage mixtures including oat (Avena sativa L.) and spring pea (Pisum sativum L. spp. sativum) provide opportunities to optimize forage production with increasing forage quality, relative to single species stands. Under different climate scenarios, adjusting seeding rates of these mixtures may produce variable results in forage quantity and quality. We conducted a 2-yr study at three study sites to evaluate forage characteristics within mixtures of oat and spring pea stands across a semi-arid to subhumid precipitation gradient. At the western-most and driest location (219 mm March-June precipitation), the oat monoculture produced 16-19% more total biomass than seeding treatments with mixtures of oat and spring pea. In contrast, at the moderate-precipitation site (255 mm precipitation), no differences in total biomass were detected for the oat monoculture and seed mixtures of oat and spring pea. Large variation at the wettest site (339 mm precipitation) limited our ability to detect differences for total biomass production across treatments, but weed pressure in Year 2 of the study reduced forage production. Typically, crude protein (CP) concentration decreased linearly (P < .01) as spring pea decreased in the seeding rate, but CP concentration and total CP yield varied for the seeding rate treatments at the different study sites. Environmental condition may influence the benefit of substituting spring pea into a properly managed oat forage crop to increase forage quality. The contribution of spring pea forage in the total forage biomass of mixtures may be limited, especially in drier conditions.

We hypothesized that the use of a mixture of a cereal and a legume could enhance yields under these low input conditions, because integrating an N-fixing legume in the system could mitigate N limitation for the cereal and enhance its growth. A nine-year (2008-2016) field experiment was set up with three treatments: sole oats, sole vetch and oats/vetch strip intercropping. These cropping systems were grown continuously in the same plots, to allow accrual of long-term effects. Yields and water use were quantified in years 7-9 of the experiment (2014 to 2016). With a 50/50 ratio of the area sown to the two species, the intercropped oats had a relative yield of 0.59 and intercropped vetch had a relative yield of 0.45. Oats was the dominant crop characterized by a relative yield per plant of 1.18, compared to a relative yield per plant of vetch of 0.89. However, the land equivalent ratio (LER), expressing the comparative efficiency of land use in intercropping, and the water equivalent ratio (WER), the comparative system level water use efficiency of the intercrop relative to sole crops, were both not significantly different from one. Thus we reject the hypothesis that oat/vetch intercropping increases land productivity and water use efficiency. From differences in results in years with more rainfall and years with less rainfall, we infer that yields of both species are mostly limited by water availability. On average over the three years, the yield disadvantage of vetch was fully compensated by the yield advantage of oats, due to a lack of complementarity for water acquisition. This conclusion can be generalized to the testable prediction that species selection for productive intercropping should focus on achieving complementarity for traits that interact with the factor most constraining productivity, which was rainfall in this particular crop system under the conditions of the study.

The treatments consisted of forage sorghum intercropped with: 'Marandu' grass; 'Marandu' grass and dwarf pigeon pea; 'Mombaca' grass; 'Mombaca' grass and dwarf pigeon pea; and dwarf pigeon pea and single sorghum, harvested for silage in the first cut and regrowth, succeeded by soybean or corn. The following calculations were made: effective operational cost, total operational costs, gross revenues, operational income, profitability index, equilibrium price, and equilibrium productivity. These variables were determined for individual crops, as well as for the sum of the crops occupying the same area over time. The sorghum consortia with 'Mombaca' grass, with or without dwarf pigeon pea, had 18 and 14% lower productivity and profitability, respectively, than the sorghum consortia with 'Marandu' grass, with or without dwarf pigeon pea.

Sixty mature range ewes (non-pregnant, non-lactating) were used in a completely randomized design repeated 2 years to determine if feeding method of intercropped field pea (Pisum sativum L.) and spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) forage (swath grazed or fed as hay in confinement) affected individual ewe mineral consumption. Thirty ewes were allocated to 3 confinement pens (10 ewes/pen) and 30 ewes were allocated to 3 grazing plots (10 ewes/plot). Ewes had ad libitum access to feed, water, and a mineral supplement containing 1% titanium dioxide as an external marker. Forage dry matter intake (DMI) was calculated using estimates of fecal output, and in vitro 48-h for-age DM digestibility. Ewe supplement intake was determined from fecal and supplement Ti concentrations, and fecal output. Forage and mineral intakes were analyzed using ewe as the experimental unit, and plot or pen as the experimental unit for intake variation. A year x treatment interaction (P<0.01) existed for DM forage and mineral intake. Ewes in confinement consumed more forage DM than grazing ewes in 2010, but less than grazing ewes in 2011. Mean mineral intake was highest (P<0.01) by grazing ewes in 2011 and 2010 (average 69 g/day), intermediate by confinement ewes in 2010 (57 g/day), and lowest by confinement ewes in 2011 (31 g/day). A yearxtreatment interaction (P=0.05) existed for mineral intake CV which was higher (P=0.04) for confinement ewes in 2011 (67 vs. 34%), but was not different (P>0.05) between treatments in 2010. In this study, variation in individual ewe intake of mineral supplement was large in both grazing ewes and ewes fed hay in confinement. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Two field bean (Vicia faba L.) and four barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivars were mono-and intercropped (additive design) in a 2-year lysimeter experiment on a sandy loam soil. The aim was to test the effect of the cropping system on dry matter and N yield of forage, the residual effect on the subsequent ryegrass crop (Lolium multiflorum Lam. westerwoldicum), and NO3-N leaching in the rotation. Land equivalent ratios were 1.65 for dry matter and 1.67 for N yield, indicating a clear advantage of the intercrop over sole crops. Both species suffered from competition, especially in terms of N resources, but barley was less affected. Nitrate leaching was the lowest from intercrop. Preceding crop significantly affected dry matter, N content and NO3-N leaching of ryegrass. Field bean sole crop gave the highest benefits to ryegrass in terms of forage dry matter and N content, but also the highest NO3-N leaching, followed by the intercrop and the barley sole crop. Barley/field bean intercropping may be an effective strategy to reduce land requirements, N leaching losses and fertilizer inputs, thereby increasing the sustainability of farming systems.

Interplanting Annual Ryegrass, Wheat, Oat, and Corn to Mitigate Iron Deficiency in Dry Beans	PLOS ONE			English	Article							"FE DEFICIENCY; CHLOROSIS; SUNFLOWER; NITROGEN; PLANTS; CHLOROPHYLL; NUTRITION; MANGANESE; NITRATE; ZINC"	This study evaluated whether grass intercropping can be used to alleviate Fe deficiency chlorosis in dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) grown in high pH, calcareous soils with low organic matter. Field studies were conducted at the University of Wyoming Sustainable Agriculture Research and Extension Center in 2009 and 2010. Black- and navy beans were grown alone or intercropped with annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.), oat (Avena sativa L.), corn (Zea mays L.), or spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in a two-factor factorial strip-plot randomized complete block design. All four grass species increased chlorophyll intensity in dry beans. However, grass species did not increase iron (Fe) concentration in dry bean tissues suggesting inefficient utilization of Fe present in the dry bean tissues. In 2009, nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) and manganese (Mn) concentration in bean tissue were greater in bean monoculture than in grass intercropped beans. Bean monoculture also had greater soil NO3-N concentrations than grass intercropped treatments. In 2009, grass intercrops reduced dry bean yield >25% compared to bean monoculture. Annual ryegrass was the least competitive of the four annual grass species. This suggests that competition from grasses for nutrients, water, or light may have outweighed benefits accruing from grass intercropping. Additional studies are required to determine the appropriate grass and dry bean densities, as well as the optimum time of grass removal.

Planting barley in fields adjacent to those of wheat and intercropping wheat with barley are cultural practices that might suppress the cosmopolitan cereal pest Sitobion avenae (F.). To evaluate the potential effects of these cultural measures on aphid outbreak risks, clones of S. avenae were collected from wheat and barley. Host-switch experiments for the collected clones were conducted in the laboratory to compare their life table parameters and other life history traits. Our results demonstrated that wheat clones of S. avenae had lower developmental times, higher fecundities, and higher growth rates compared with barley clones when tested on the plant of origin. When transferred to barley, the performance of wheat clones was decreased in terms of developmental times of nymphs and age at first reproduction of adults. Barley clones' performance was decreased in terms of reproductive time or lifespan of adult on wheat compared with that on barley. The age-specific survival rates of barley clones tended to be lower than wheat clones in the earlier part of their lives on wheat. The age-specific fecundity of barley clones on barley remained low and fluctuated significantly during their lifetime. Although quite a few significant correlations between developmental and reproductive traits were identified on both plants, no significantly negative correlations (i.e., trade-offs) for the traits were found between plants. The results suggested that barley clones could be generalized but wheat clones were more specialized to their host plant. The potential benefits of the abovementioned cultural measures were discussed.

The rotation sequence was repeated twice. Natural N-15 abundance techniques were used to determine grain legume N-2 fixation and N-15 labeling technique to determine the fate of pea and oat residue N recovery in the subsequent crop. The subsequent spring wheat and winter triticale crop yields were not significantly affected by the previous main crop, but a significant effect of catch crop undersowing was observed. A higher soil mineral N content in the soil profile without undersown grass-clover increased the spring wheat yield. This effect was circumvented in the subsequent winter triticale, where yields in the treatments with catch crops undersown were significantly greater. The grass-clover catch crop after grain legumes had a higher grass proportion before incorporation as compared to grass-clover after oat, which had the greatest clover proportion. The dynamic response of interspecific interactions in the catch crop to the soil mineral N levels is moderating the preceding effect of main crops in the subsequent cereal - and sometimes to a higher degree than the main crop effect. For research involving rotation principles it is recommended to evaluate cumulative effects over several years and not only single seasons. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Winter Wheat and Red Clover Intercrop Response to Tillage and Compost Amendment	CROP SCIENCE			English	Article							"FORAGE PRODUCTION; COVER CROPS; GRAIN-YIELD; NO-TILL; CORN; CEREAL; ROTATION; SOIL; ESTABLISHMENT; PRODUCTIVITY"	Frost-seeding red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) into winter cereals is an efficient establishment method, although performance under contrasting soil management practices remains unclear. Wheat and intercropped red clover productivity were evaluated in intensive tillage (IT), moderate tillage (MT), and no tillage (NT) with and without compost amendment in a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]-winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and red clover rotation between 2005 and 2010. Wheat yields were not affected by tillage system and averaged 3.80 Mg ha(-1) but were 10% higher in compost amended soil compared to no compost. Red clover plant density and dry matter (DM) at cereal grain harvest averaged 127 plants m(-2) and 32 g m(-2) and were not affected by tillage or amendment treatments. Maximum wheat canopy light interception was attained in late May to early June and ranged from 84 to 91% and typically exceeded 77% light interception for at least 22 d. Red clover root DM increased on average 378% between wheat harvest and 40 d after harvest compared with a 64% average increase in red clover root length. Red clover shoot: root averaged 8.5 at wheat harvest compared with 11.2 40 d after wheat harvest. Producers using this wheat and red clover intercrop should expect no difference in wheat yield or red clover productivity when using IT, MT, or NT.

Clover was undersown in spring barley and remained established in two consecutive crops of wheat in two field experiments. Clover reduced grain yield in the first crop of wheat and increased it in the second. There was more inorganic N in the soil and a higher concentration of N in the grains in the intercropping system. The grain and N yield response to fertiliser N was equal or less with intercropped than with wheat alone. The reduction of clover biomass with a herbicide increased grain yield of the first crop of wheat without reducing the clover biomass or the positive residual effect in the second wheat crop. It was concluded that in order to produce large grain yields, competition from clover needs to be kept small when wheat is at the tillering stage.

The clover varieties Sonja, S 184 and AberCrest, differing in leaf size and winter hardiness, were undersown in spring barley. Three consecutive crops of winter wheat or one Crop of winter rape sown at two densities followed the barley. In the first year, the mature yields of wheat and high density rape equalled yields without white clover when AberCrest was used. while Sonja reduced the wheat yield by one third and the rape yield to nothing. S 184 was intermediate. White clover increased yields by 14-19% in the second wheat crop, but had no effect in the weed infested third wheat crop. The average amount of white clover at flowering of wheat was always largest with Sonja, which increased its biomass earlier in spring than AberCrest. It was concluded that white clover traits are important when developing the intercropping system for large mature yields, especially when herbicides are avoided.

CMI varied primarily in the amounts of nitrogen fertilizer, herbicide, and tillage used. Infestation of wheat plants was measured from 1990 through 1993 as the percentage of white grain heads caused by larval feeding within the stems. Adult counts were made from sweep net samples within plots 3 to 5 times per year from 1991 through 1993. Larval infestation varied among years but not by CMI. The mean percentages of white heads in 1991 (2.0%) was greater than in other years (each less than or equal to 1.3%). Counts of adult M. americana differed among sampling dates within years but not by CMI. The number of adults collected was bimodal, peaking on the first and last sampling dates each year. The interpretation of our results is discussed in the context of cropping systems research.

Fiori & Paol.) + chickpea (Cicer arictinum L.) and wheat + mustard [Brassica juncea (L.) Czernj & Cosson j] intercropping at 4:2 ratio with 2 levels of irrigation and mulch at Kalyani. Dry-matter accumulation continued in chickpea up to 105 days after sowing. Maximum dry matter was recorded with wheat + mustard intercropping at 90 days after sowing. Levels of irrigation and straw mulch influenced the dry-matter accumulation. The combined leaf-area index of wheat + chick-pea was higher than that of wheat + mustard. Wheat + chickpea recorded the highest water use (mm), water-use efficiency and also intercepted higher amount of solar energy due to better crop canopy over the wheat + mustard intercropping. Straw mulch appeared very much beneficial for the systems of cropping. Both levels of irrigation and straw mulch always had a beneficial effect on the yields of all the 3 crops. Grain yield of wheat was higher when grown with chickpea than when grown with mustard. Wheat + chickpea intercropping was superior to wheat + mustard regarding land-equivalent ratio and area-time equivalent ratio. However, relative net return and relative value totals were higher in wheat + mustard. Straw mulch was beneficial for irrigation requirement of winter crops like wheat, mustard and chickpea.

The use of cover crops had a positive impact on the yield of marketable roots of carrot in comparison with the cultivation without the cover crops. A significant increase of marketable yield was noted after phacelia, buckwheat, mustard and sunflower. The flat ploughless tillage significantly reduced the marketable yield of roots in comparison with traditional ploughing. The largest marketable yield of roots was obtained from cultivation on ridges after mixing the biomass of buckwheat or phacelia or mustard with the soil, and the smallest, after reduced spring tillage using aggregate without cover crops. The largest marketable yield in flat ploughless tillage was obtained when using grubber before winter, and the biomass of phacelia was mixed with soil. Growing carrot on the ridges had a positive influence on increasing the share of the marketable yield of roots in comparison with other variants of cultivation including the conventional tillage. The all cover crops with the exception of spring vetch significantly increased the share of marketable roots in the yield compared with cultivation without cover crops. The largest percentage of the marketable yield was noted after use of phacelia.

Over the past couple of decades, an increase in grain prices and decline in wool prices have led to the expansion of cropping into the high rainfall zone (HRZ) in southern Australia. While there has been a great deal of research into integrated crop-livestock systems for the medium to low rainfall environments in the wheat-sheep zone, there is much less information and many challenges confronting farmers to effectively integrate crops into the grazing systems in the high rainfall zone due to climatic and environmental differences and the complexity of the systems in Australia. This paper reviews the benefits of integrated crop-livestock systems and the challenges in implementing and managing these systems based on current Australian and international knowledge. The concept, types and terminology of integrated crop-livestock systems are discussed to provide greater clarity. Plant species, particularly annual and perennial legumes, are reviewed to find species with potential for use in integrated crop livestock systems. Major gaps and opportunities for further research and development are identified, and recommendations proposed for developing effective integrated crop-livestock systems for the HRZ. These include: 1) Targeted R&D on ICL systems in the HRZ of southern Australia assisted with information from and outside Australia; 2) Biophysical and bio-economic modelling using current knowledge from the HRZ and other environments to guide future research; 3) Studies on N fixation, transfer and losses to develop strategies to balance N cycling and reduce N losses; 4) Development of compatible species/cultivars for ICL systems in the HRZ; 5) Management of waterlogging through ICL in the HRZ; 6) Effective stubble management to minimise the negative impact on crops and pastures; 7) Integrated research on grain yield reduction in crop-pasture intercropping, a potentially major type of ICL systems in the HRZ; and 8) Effective control of weeds, pests and diseases in ICL systems for the HRZ.

(Moench)] opens a fruitful area of research to exploit this phenomenon in weed control and regulation of nutrients cycle. The data suggests that sorghum allelopathy can be exploited in different cropping practices [cover crop, smother crop, companion crop. mixing crop and smother crop to control weeds and inhibition of nitrification] and, application of its water extracts in fields controls the weeds and enhances the crops productivity. The herbicidal and allelopathic properties of sorgoleone. a compound isolated from root exudates of sorghum and other allelochemicals in sorghum deserve further work to identify the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis oil these compounds and the genes encoding them. Besides there is need to use genetic engineering to manipulate the identified genes in sorghum or in other crops to enhance their ability to suppress the weeds, This review addresses the research on the role of allelopathic potential in different cropping systems and the approaches developed in weeds management.

The treatments consisted of corn; Brachiaria humidicola; Panicum maximum cv Aruana; corn + Brachiaria humidicola, corn + Panicum maximum cv Aruana. The concentrations of total organic carbon, particulate organic carbon and organic carbon associated with minerals were analyzed in the soil at depths 0-5, 5-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm. Increases and reductions of carbon stocks in organic matter fractions, using the Cerrado as a reference, were also analyzed. The results demonstrated that the systems with intercropping and fodder caused different effects on organic matter pools. Because of the short period of no-till the changes promoted by crops in organic matter fractions were more significant in the soil surface layers. Under no-till, maize only or intercropped with Brachiaria humidicola promoted an increase in total organic carbon and organic carbon fractions, when the native cerrado soil was used as reference.

Influence of cropping intensity on the production and properties of earthworm casts in a leucaena alley cropping system	BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS			English	Article						"cropping intensity; earthworm casts; leucaena; alley cropping"	"WORM CASTS; SOIL; INFILTRATION; ECOSYSTEM; NITROGEN"	The effect of cropping intensity on surface cast production by earthworms was studied more than 4 years in an alley cropping system. The plots were cultivated to maize-cassava intercrop every year (100% cropping intensity), after 2 years of fallow (33% cropping intensity) and after 3 years of fallow (25% cropping intensity). Cast production was assessed by the continuous sampling technique proposed by Hauser and Asawalam (Z Pflanzenernahr Bodenkd 161:23-30, 1998). Results showed that cropping intensity enhanced cast production in the first year, did not affect it in the second and third years and decreased cast production in the fourth year. Amount of casts deposited within the alleys was highest under the hedgerow and decreased towards the middle of the alley. The concentrations of organic matter and plant nutrients were significantly higher in worm casts than in soil, irrespective of the cropping intensity and position of sample collection within the interrow space. Continuous cropping up to 6 years significantly reduced the concentrations of organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and exchangeable calcium, potassium and magnesium in the top 0-5 cm of the soil, irrespective of the distance from the hedgerow. Regardless of the intensity of cropping, there is a strong linear association between the quantity of casts and the amount of organic carbon, and other nutrients in casts.

To determine the effects of sugarcane and a newly bred mung bean variety intercropping and mung bean crop residue recycling on sugarcane growth and soil, a two-year field study was conducted in Guangxi, China, from 2015 to 2016. The results showed that the sugarcane and mung bean intercropping and mung bean crop residue recycling could improve the growth and the production of sugarcane and enhance the accumulation of dry matter, N, P, and K in the aboveground part of sugarcane as well as the availability of N, P, K, and organic matter in soil. Even though intercropping and crop residue recycling could stimulate the availability of N, P, K, and organic matter, it could not override the negative influence of N, P, and K reductions, but the impact of K reduction was least. Ultimately, the dry matter, N, P, and K of mung bean crop residue on soil surface degraded faster than those of deep burial. Our research suggested that the newly bred mung bean variety is a proper intercropping candidate for sugarcane field in Guangxi.

Cultural pattern of intercropping was implemented using additive series. The experiment was arranged as a factorial on a randomized complete block design with three replications. The first factor was onion densities (300,000, 250,000 and 200,000 plant ha(-1)) and the second one was fenugreek densities at three levels (250,000,150,000 and 120,000 plant ha(-1)) along with sole each mono crop of the mixture. The results showed that the highest total bulb yield of onion (46.6 th(-1)) was obtained with 30 plant m(-2 )density. Maximum biological yield (5.43 th(-1)) of fenugreek was observed in 25 plant m(-2). Regarding two years mean, the highest land equivalent ratio (LER) (2.96) and relative value total (RVT) (1.58) related to the treatment combination of onion and fenugreek with 25:25 and 30:15 plant m(-2) respectively. These suggest that onion and fenugreek intercropping had more productivity than monocropping of them. Maximum LER and RVT were achieved at the higher densities of onion (30 plant m(-2)) and fenugreek (15 plant m(-2)). Onion and fenugreek are favorable for intercropping because they are complementary, and interactively contribute to increasing the yield per unit area and improving the nutritional properties. Also, it was confirmed that farmers can attain more revenue with inter-cropping onion and fenugreek. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of different intercropping and spacing arrangements of corn (Zea mays L) and crotalaria (Crotalaria spp) on the agronomic characteristics, chemical composition and forage digestibility. The experiment was distributed in a randomized complete block design with a 2 x 2 + 1 factorial scheme. The treatments were two cultivation systems (corn + Crotalaria juncea (CCJ) intercropping, and corn + Crotalaria ochroleuca (CCO) intercropping), in two spacing arrangements (A1 (corn and crotalaria sown in the same row) and A2 (corn and crotalaria sown in alternate rows)) plus control (single corn monocropping (CSC)), with six replicates per treatment, for 2 years. Forage plants were harvested when the corn grain reached the doughy-farinaceous phenological stage. Forage mass (total and of each species), morphological composition, chemical composition and in vitro digestibility were evaluated. The forage accumulation was higher for the A1 spatial arrangement. In the second year, the highest total forage mass was verified in the CCO intercropping (11 140 kg/ha). The highest corn mass (9402 kg/ha) was observed for CSC. The highest crotalaria mass was observed in the CCJ intercropping in both years. Regarding the chemical composition, CCJ and CCO intercropping had the highest crude protein concentration. The lowest acid detergent fibre concentration was observed in CSC and CCO intercropping, directly reflecting the in vitro dry matter digestibility coefficients. It is concluded that C. ochroleuca, sown between corn rows, had higher forage accumulation and nutritive value among the treatments tested in this experiment.	"[Jara Galeano, E. S.; Costa, C.

J	"Dahmardeh, M; Hodiani, A"				"Dahmardeh, Mehdi; Hodiani, Abdolvahed"			Assessment of soil elements in intercropping based on mathematical modelling	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						"Intercropping; Mathematical modeling; Tillage; Soil fertility"	"ORGANIC-CARBON; MAIZE; FERTILIZATION; MANAGEMENT; TILLAGE"	Restoring diversity in agricultural ecosystems and its effective management is one of the key strategies in sustainable agriculture. Intercropping as, an example of sustainable agriculture systems, follows objectives, such as the ecological balance, more efficient use of resources, and increase soil fertility. Investigating soil elements in intercropping is a basic criterion for selecting the type of intercropping and increasing soil productivity. This paper presents a nonlinear mathematical model for evaluating the elements of the soil that resulted from intercropping Roselle and Mung bean. To estimate the amount of carbon, nitrogen, and sodium, the independent variables including different proportions of intercropping (100%, 50%, 25%, and 0% Roselle) and type of tillage (No tillage, Reduce Tillage, and Conventional tillage) have been used in elements based on a nonlinear form mathematical expressions. Roselle was selected for intercropping with Mung bean that was evaluated in three different soil tillage methods. Elements have been calibrated in two phases and based on the presented non-linear mathematical model based on an iterative procedure. In the first phase, the soil temperature was fitted based on the type of tillage and intercropping ratio and in the second phase, it was fitted based on the fitted temperature and type of tillage and several intercropping ratio. Changes in the nutrient with respect to sensitivity analysis of the presented nonlinear mathematical model were assessed based on the intercropping type at different tillage. The results from the nonlinear modeling showed that with increase in Mung bean in inter cropping, the contribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen are increased and the carbon: nitrogen (C/N) ratio is decreased. Comparing no-tillage systems in terms of rates of soil organic carbon and nitrogen is more than other tillage systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In Kenya, current PPN management practices in sweet potato have several limitations hence the need for alternative low-cost management strategies. This study evaluated the impact of intercropping maize and sweet potato (MS) and application of Tithonia diversifolia (MG), cow (CM) and goat manure (GM) on population dynamics of PPN and the effect on metabolic footprints, ecological and functional indices. Field experiments were established in a randomized complete block design involving the four treatments and unamended controls. Soil samples were collected during long (LR) and short (SR) rains seasons. Forty-seven nematode genera were identified in both seasons. Principle response curves analysis revealed that goat manure had the most pronounced effect on PPN. There were differences in metabolic footprints, ecological and functional indices during LR and SR. In CM plots, predator footprint was high during the long rains season. Functional metabolic footprints categorized all plots as degraded in both seasons except MS which was structured in SR. However, CM bordered a structured ecosystem in both seasons while GM bordered a structured ecosystem in LR. Goat manure may have enhanced the natural ability of soil to regulate PPN affecting sweet potato and it may provide an alternative sustainable method of PPN control for smallholders.

The objective of this study was to quantify the effect of slash and burn on soil quality. Two sites, Ibadan (7 degrees 23 N; 3 degrees 51 E) and Akure (7 degrees 17 N; 5 degrees 14 E), within the tropical rainforest of Nigeria were selected for the study. Burnt and unburnt soils were cropped with maize, melon, and cowpea (in sole and intercrops). Soil and earthworm cast samples were collected and analyzed for physical, chemical, and biological indicators. Integration into soil processes and quality indices involved the transformation of analyzed indicators using Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) and Multiple Variable Indicator Transform (MVIT) techniques. Organic matter, water-stable aggregates, pH, cation exchange capacity, macroporosity, and water infiltration were reduced after burning in both sites. Active carbon and potentially mineralizable nitrogen increased after burning at Ibadan but decreased after burning at Akure. Soil quality decreased after burning by a range of 11.3-24.8% using SMAF and MVIT, respectively, although only MVIT showed significant differences (p0.05). Test crops increased in yields on burnt soils due to prompt release of nutrients to the crops; the benefit was dwarfed by the adverse effects of burning on soil quality indices."

Scale and spatial structure effects on the outcome of barley cultivar mixture trials for disease control	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Diversity; Blends; Epidemiology; Powdery mildew; Blumeria graminis f.sp hordei"	"F-SP HORDEI; GENOTYPE UNIT AREA; MIXED STANDS; CEREAL CULTIVARS; POWDERY MILDEW; RUST; PURE; DIVERSITY; EPIDEMICS; SELECTION"	The effects of field-trial scale, including plot size, and its interaction with fertiliser level and barley germplasm on mixture efficacy in controlling powdery mildew were investigated. Two groups of cultivars, one from cultivars grown in the UK and the other from cultivars grown in Poland, along with all their respective three-component mixtures, were grown in three field trials, one with 13.5 m(2) plots, one with 0.4m(2) plots, and the third in intermediate size plots, which included a mixture of all the cultivars in both groups in equal size treatments of structured spatial arrangements. Another trial utilised similar structured spatial arrangements to trial 3 was carried out using a combination of cultivars with appropriate matching virulence levels (trial 4). Mixtures showed either a reduction in powdery mildew infection compared with the component monoculture mean, or no significant effect. There was a trend towards greater reductions at the low fertiliser level and smaller plot size. The most structured spatial arrangement was most effective for reducing infection in trials 3 and 4, but the complex-homogeneous arrangement in the fourth trial was also effective. Rhynchosporium was reduced by a similar and substantial amount by both spatial treatments in trial 3. The plot size and structuring effects may be explained by the interaction between host heterogeneity structure and pathogen dispersal scale effects, but resource exploitation for yield was best in the complex-homogeneous arrangement in trial 3 where all components were present to respond directly. These findings have implications for methods of trialling mixtures for large-scale field use and for testing component combining ability. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	"[Newton, A.

Over 3 years, there was a correspondence between the mixtures' disease response and the pathogenicity of isolates sampled from them. In 1998, with a severe epidemic, mixtures were 9.4% less diseased than were their component pure stands (P = 0.0045), and pathogen populations from mixtures caused 27% less disease (P = 0.085) in greenhouse assays than did populations from component pure stands. In 1999, the epidemic was mild, mixtures did not reduce disease severity (P = 0.39), and pathogen populations from mixtures and pure stands did not differ in pathogenicity (P = 0.42). In 2000, epidemic intensity was intermediate, mixture plots were 15.2% more diseased than the mean of component pure stands (P = 0.053), and populations from two of four mixtures were 152 and 156% more pathogenic than the mean of populations from component pure stands (P = 0.043 and 0.059, respectively). Mixture yields were on average 2.4 and 6.2% higher than mean component pure-stand yields in 1999 and 2000, respectively, but the differences were not statistically significant. The ability of mixtures challenged with M. graminicola to suppress disease appears to be inconsistent. In this system, host genotype mixtures evidently do not consistently confer either fitness benefits or liabilities on pathogen populations.

J	JAMRISKA, P				JAMRISKA, P			INTERCROP EFFECT OF UNDERSOWING WITH SOME CLOVER CROPS	ROSTLINNA VYROBA			Czech	Article								"In the years 1986 to 1989 the effect of undersowing of clover crops Medicago sativa, M. lupulina; Trifolium pratense, T. repens, T. incarnatum; Onobrychiss viciaefolia; Lotus corniculatus; Anthyllis vulneraria into grain spring barley was studied as compared with the control without undersowing. The trials have been establishing in the maize-growing region on loam degraded Chernozem with slight-acid soil response. The experimental site (170 m above sea level) has average annual temperature 9.1-degrees-C and 625 m of rainfall per year, 15.73-degrees-C in the growing season and 352 mm of rainfall. Characteristics of weather conditions: 1986: rainfall 108 - 127 %, temperatures 99 - 103 %: 1987 rainfall 90 %, temperatures 83 - 96; 1988: rainfall 95 - 92 %, temperatures 98 - 100 %: 1989: rainfall 66 - 80 %, temperatures 102 - 100 %. The first figure means an average value of normal per year and the latter - of the normal for the growing season. After harvest of barley and removal of straw, undersowings were left for 79 days on average to their ploughing up, in the second year - the overall experimental plot was sown with grain oats. The ferztilizing was uniform, only control was fertilized in the case of oats. that is in the dose of 25 kg of N per 1 ha. The following traits were assessed: barley grain yields. density and height of stand, some indicators of the grain quality, grain yield, straw yield, oat stand density. and some indicators of its chemical composition. Undersown T incarnatum and L. corniculatus reduced the barley grain on average of first years (Tab. I), in the others the falling tendency was insignificant. The differences among yields were highly significant in the experimental years. Undersowings reduced barley grain yield solely in the most yielding year (1987), that is O. viciaefolia, T repens, T incarnatum highly significantly, and M. lupulina significantly, the effect of L corniculatus was on the limit of significance. Grain yields with undersown M. sativa and T repens were affected the most by weather conditions. The lowest straw yield without clover crops was recorded with undersown L corniculatus, the highest was in the control. The height of barley stand was not affected by undersowings. The thinnest stand was observed with L. corniculatus undersown and the thickest with A. vulneraria undersown. Protein content in barley grain was affected by weather conditions alone (Tab. II), like the starch content. 1000-kernel weight (TKW) and malt extract were not affected by the studied factors. Undersowing residues, except for M. lupulina, were increasing on average the grain yield (Tab. III) of oat sown after barley, by A. vulneraria and T. repens significantly and by all the rest highly significantly. Weather and site conditions (years) were of highly significant influence. A significant effect of undersowings was manifested in the oat yield in the year with the highes (1989) and the lowest (1987) yields. Residue of undersowings had no effect on the stand (1988) followed after barley ploughed-in which the negative effect of undersowings was displayed. In 1987 the residue of L. corniculaatus and O. viciaefolia undersown had a positive effect on oat grain yield. In 1989 the residue of all undersowing acted significantly positively, except for T. repens and M. lupulina. There is an insignificant tendency of higher values of straw yield after undersowings than without them. The similar tendency is apparent in the density where the greatest density of the stand was recorded in oats after T. repens undersown, the thinnest was in the control. Some indicators of average chemical composition of grain and oat straw (Tab. IV) were not affected, in principle, by undersowing of clover crops under study. Neither years had no effects on the ash content in oat grain. Crude protein contained in oat grain was higher in 1988 than in the other years. Fibre content in straw was highly significantly lower in 1987. All variants after urdersowings exhibited in average assessment insignificantly lower content than the control. The lowest content of crude protein in oat straw was recorded in 1989, average values were below values of the control (insignificantly) only in the variants after T. pratense and A. vulneraria undersown. Straw dry matter digestibility was higher in 1989 than in 1988. Variants with undersowings, except for T. incarnatum, had insignificantly higher values in average assessment than the control. Phosphorus, potassium and calcium contents in oat straw were affected once more by the years. The greatest variation interval of average values was exhibited by phosphorus content (89 %), the lowest interval wass in potassium content (11 %)."

J	Carson, ML				Carson, M. L.			Crown Rust Development and Selection for Virulence in Puccinia coronata f. sp avenae in an Oat Multiline Cultivar	PLANT DISEASE			English	Article							"UNITED-STATES; PATHOGEN POPULATION; ERYSIPHE-GRAMINIS; VARIETY MIXTURES; DISEASE CONTROL; MIXED STANDS; SP TRITICI; RESISTANCE; EVOLUTION; FREQUENCIES"	Crown rust, Caused by Purcinia coronata F. sp. avenue is the most important disease of cultivated oat in North America. Numerous race-specific (Pc) genes for crown rust have been found in Avena spp. but this type of resistance has not been durable when used in oat cultivars. Increasing diversity for resistance within a crop by the use of multiline cultivars or varietal mixtures has been proposed its a means of achieving durable resistance to highly variable pathogens such as P. coronata f. Sp. Multiline cv. E77 was evaluated over multiple seasons in the University of Minnesota buckthorn nursery in St. Paul. Buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica, the alternate host of P. coronata) Supports a sexually recombining, highly diverse crown rust population in the St. Paul nursery. Crown rust severity on flap! leaves was measured multiple times on E77 and its 10 component lines during grain filling. Single-uredinioispore isolates taken from crown rust samples during early stages of the epidemic and at the end of the epidemic were tested for virulence on the 10 component lines of E77 in greenhouse seedling tests, Crown rust development was reduced in E77 compared with the weighted mean of the component lines at all stages of the crown rust epidemics. The mean virulence of single urediniospore isolates tended to increase late in the epidemic on E77. These data suggest that multilines may select for complex virulence or super races and any resistance effect may not be durable.

Intercropping is receiving increasing attention because it offers potential advantages for resource utilization, decreased inputs and increased sustainability in crop production, but our understanding of the interactions among intercropped species is still very limited. 2. We grew pea Pisum sativum, barley Hordeum vulgare and rape Brassica napus as sole crops and intercrops under field conditions using a replacement design. We collected total dry matter data from sequential harvests and fitted the data to a logistic growth model. At each harvest we estimated the relative Competitive Strength (CS) of the three crops by fitting the data to a simple interspecific competition model. 3. The pea monocrop produced the largest amount of biomass from the middle to the end of the growth period, but pea was not dominant in intercrops. 4. Fitting data to a logistic growth model emphasizes the importance of initial size differences for interactions among intercrops. Barley was the dominant component of the intercrops largely because of its initial size advantage. The competitive effect of barley on its companion crops, measured as CS, increased throughout most of the growing season. 5. The performance of each crop species was very different when it grew with a second species rather than in monoculture, but addition of a third crop species had only minor effects on behaviour of the individual crops. 6. Synthesis and applications. Including sequential harvests in experiments on intercropping can provide important information about how competitive hierarchies are established and change over time. Our results suggest that increased understanding of the role of asymmetric competition among species and the resulting advantages of early germination and seedling emergence would be valuable in designing intercrops. More focus on understanding the mechanisms that govern interactions between intercropped species is needed for designing optimized intercropping systems.

In the current study cropping system treatments consisting of: spring cereal monocrops (SMC), either oats (Avena sativa L.) or barley (Hordeum vulgare L.); winter cereal monocrops (WMC), either winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) or winter triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack); binary mixtures of the spring and winter cereals planted together as intercrops (IC) in the spring at the same time; and a doublecrop (DC) system where the winter cereal was planted into the spring cereal after one clipping were grown during 2 yr at Lacombe, Alberta. Pasture was simulated by clipping the stands five times, beginning at the joint stage of the spring cereal and four times subsequently at about 4-wk intervals. Prior to each clip, tiller weight, tiller density, tiller height and leaf area index (LAI) were measured in each sward. Differences for yield among treatments within systems did not occur, so small differences in sward structure were considered to be due to a compensatory interaction of yield components which stabilized yield and were ignored. Sward structure appeared to explain differences among systems for yield distribution. Tiller density and LAI of the SMC and spring component of the IC and DC became relatively small as the season advanced, especially after cut 2. Tiller density and LAI of the WMC were maintained at high levels throughout the season after cut 1. After cut 2 the winter cereal components of the IC and DC were responsible for the maintenance of total tiller density and LAI in their respective swards. Average seasonal total LAI were 3.36, 3.02, 1.87 and 1.17 cm2 cm-2 in the WMC, IC, DC and SMC. Late planting and competition for light from the taller spring cereal component delayed tillering of the winter cereal component in the DC compared with the IC during midsummer (cuts 2 and 3) resulting in the low average LAI. In contrast, planting the spring and winter cereal components at the same time (IC) resulted in a relatively stable total tiller density, high average LAI and yield. Thus the superior yield distribution of the IC, shown previously, was due to the complementary way in which spring and winter cereal tillers responded to clipping when planting occurred at the same time."

Treatments for simulated grazing were spring oat (Avena sativa L.), and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) monocrops (SMC), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and winter triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack) monocrops (WMC), spring and winter cereal binary mixtures, seeded together in the spring (intercrop-IC) and the winter cereal seeded after one clipping of the spring cereal (double crop-DC). Clippings were initiated at the jointing stage of the spring cereals and were repeated at intervals of 4 wk. The SMC produced the highest yields during the first two cuts (mid-June and mid-July), but regrowth declined thereafter. The WMC generally had superior yields after mid-July. The IC yield was similar to the higher of the SMC or WMC at any cut with more uniform productivity over the growing season. The DC was inferior to the IC for late summer and fall production. Averaged over years the IC produced 92 and 87% as much DM in the fall as the WMC at Lacombe and Brooks, respectively. Yield totalled over all cuts resulted in the sequence IC > WMC > DC > SMC. The IC is a feasible season-long pasture system under irrigation in southern Alberta and under rain-fed conditions in central Alberta.

CORRELATION BETWEEN LONG-TERM FERTILIZATION AND SOIL ENZYME ACTIVITY IN THE RHIZOSPHERE OF HALOPHYTES	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						"appropriate temperatures; phosphorus; potassium; microbial fertilizer"		In order to reveal the correlation between long-term different fertilization methods and soil enzyme activity in rhizosphere of halophytes, Salicornia salina was selected as the research object and cultured in root bags in coastal saline soil. The effects of plastic film mulching, non-plastic film mulching and non-fertilization on invertase, catalase and urease activities in rhizosphere soil of Salicornia salsa during its growth period were studied, while the effects of plastic film mulching and non-fertilization on the activities of invertase, catalase and urease in the rhizospheric soil of Salicornia salicornis were also investigated. Bacillus, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus amylolytica and compound microbial fertilizers had effects on the activities of three soil enzymes. The results showed that the activities of S-SC, S-CAT and S-UE could be promoted by mulching and that fertilization at any time, and the effect of mulching combined with fertilization was the best. Soil enzyme activity showed the same change pattern during the growth period of Salicornia salina The highest activity of soil invertase and urease occurred at jointing stage, and the highest activity of soil catalase occurred at maturity stage. Compared to spraying treatment, adding compound microbial fertilizer could increase catalase activity by 6.3% and 4.0% at different stages, while adding Bacillus amyloliquefaciens microbial fertilizer, the activity of sucrase and urease increased by 20.7% and 18.6%, respectively, and 21.8% and 4.6%, respectively in different periods. In conclusion, the application of plastic film mulching combined with fertilization, inorganic fertilizer and microbial fertilizer can improve soil enzyme activity and soil fertility, and enhance the sustainable productivity of soil.

Management of a previously eroded tropical Alfisol with herbaceous legumes: Soil loss and physical properties under mound tillage	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH			English	Article						"alfisols; West Africa; cover crops; traditional tillage; residue; soil erosion"	"LONG-TERM TILLAGE; WESTERN NIGERIA; SLOPE LENGTH; CROP YIELD; MAIZE; RUNOFF; EROSIVITY; EROSION; ROUGH"	A study was carried out on a previously eroded Oxic Paleustalf in Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria to determine the extent of soil degradation under mound tillage with some herbaceous legumes and residue management methods. A series of factorial experiments was carried out on 12 existing runoff plots. The study commenced in 1996 after a 5-year natural fallow. Mound tillage was introduced in 1997 till 1999. The legumes - Vigna unguiculata (cowpea), Mucuna pruriens and Pueraria phaseoloides - were intercropped with maize in 1996 and 1998 while yam was planted alone in 1997 and 1999. This paper covers 1997-1999. At the end of each year, residues were either burned or mulched on respective plots. Soil loss, runoff, variations in mound height, bulk density, soil water retention and sorptivity were measured. Cumulative runoff was similar among interactions of legume and residue management in 1997 (57-151 mm) and 1999 (206-397 mm). However, in 1998, cumulative runoff of 95 mm observed for Mucuna-burned residue was significantly greater than the 46 mm observed for cowpea-burned residue and the 39-51 mm observed for mulched residues of cowpea, Mucuna and Pueraria. Cumulative soil loss of 7.6 Mg ha(-1) observed for Mucuna-burned residue in 1997 was significantly greater than those for Pueraria-mulched (0.9 Mg ha(-1)) and Mucuna-mulched (1.4 Mg ha(-1)) residues whereas in 1999 it was similar to soil loss from cowpea treatments and Pueraria-burned residue (2.3-5.3 Mg ha(-1)). There were no significant differences in soil loss in 1998 (1-3.2 Mg ha(-1)) whereas Mucuna-burned residue had a greater soil loss (28.6 Mg ha(-1)) than mulched cowpea (6.9 Mg ha(-1)) and Pueraria (5.4 Ms ha(-1)). Mound heights (23 cm average) decreased non-linearly with cumulative rainfall. A cumulative rainfall of 500 mm removed 0.3-2.3 cm of soil from mounds in 1997, 3.5-6.9 cm in 1998 and 2.3-4.6 cm in 1999, indicating that (detached but less transported) soil from mounds was far higher than observed soil loss in each year. Soil water retention was improved at potentials ranging from -1 to -1500 kPa by Mucuna-mulched residue compared to the various burned-residue treatments. Also, mound sorptivity at -1 cm water head (14.3 cm h(-1/2)) was higher than furrow sorptivity (8.5 cm h(-1/2)), indicating differences in hydraulic characteristics between mound and furrow. Pueraria-mulched residues for mounds had the highest sorptivity of 17.24 cm h(-1/2), whereas the least value of 6.96 cm h(-1/2) was observed in furrow of Mucuna-burned residue. Pueraria phas eoloides was considered the best option for soil conservation on the previously eroded soil, cultivated with mound tillage. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The experimental design was randomized block with three replications consisting of eggplant monoculture (CK), eggplant relay intercropping with normal garlic (NG) and eggplant relay intercropping with green garlic (GG). It is showed that the eggplant stem in 2011 was first thicker then thinner in CK than NG, and it was always thicker in CK than GG; the plant height and stem diameter were both higher in relay intercropping treatments than CK in 2012. The chlorophyll content and chlorophyll a/b ratio were lower in NG compared with CK in most cases. In 2011, the eggplant yield and combined output value in GG were lower than CK, but in 2012, they were higher and the difference of combined output value between GG and CK was significant; for NG, they were always promoted both in 2011 and 2012. Different results between 2011 and 2012 may be due to the different time of green garlic uprooted in the spring. It is proved that uprooting green garlic before eggplant transplanting in 2012 was better to eggplant growth than uprooting them after eggplant transplanting in 2011. The conclusions are drawn that relay intercropping with normal or green garlic can improve the eggplant growth, increase the yield and the combined output value. As a result, eggplant/garlic relay intercropping systems may contribute to sustainable production of eggplant."

Impact of crop-crop diversity on pod-borer (Helicoverpa armigera) of pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan)	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						"pigeonpea; Cajanus cajan; intercropping; Helicoverpa armigera; grain damage; agronomical evaluation"	MAIZE	An experiment was conducted during rainy (kharif) season 2003 and 2004 at Hyderabad to study the impact of crop -crop diversity on incidence of pod-borer [Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner)] on pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp]. The incidence of major pod-borer H. armigera varied temporally across cropping systems and significant fluctuation was noticed even at peak level of population (13-16 weeks after sowing). Intercropping also caused significant variation in pod and grain damage by pod-borers Maruca vitrata (Geyer), Exelastis atomosa (Walsingham) and Melanagromyza obtusa (Malloch). The intercrops, viz sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) and blackgram (Vigna mungo (L.) Hepper) reduced the pod damage by H. armigera, M vitrata, and M. obtusa significantly. The grain damage by lepidopteran borers was less in pigeonpea + sorghum (15.15%), pigeonpea + groundnut (22.26%) and pigeonpea + blackgram (20.49%) intercropping systems. These effective cropping systems registered highest pigeonpea equivalent yields that was in the range of 0.97-1.11 tonnes/ha. Further these systems were more efficient agronomically in terms of land equivalent ratio (1.04-1.31), aggressivity (1.03-1.49), competitive ratio (1.77-1.97) and relative crowding coefficient (4.08 - 9.59). Economic analysis showed these intercropping systems to be more profitable than the sole pigeonpea.

It was found that the rate and direction of evolution of pathogen aggressiveness in a race-non-specific system and value at equilibrium, depends on initial resistance levels, proportions of component cultivars, autodeposition rates, the relative magnitude of the benefit of autoinfection, and the cost of alloinfection of spores. In the model, mixing cultivars in any proportions tended to reduce the aggressiveness of pathogens at equilibrium compared with pure stands, but this effect decreased when two mixture components were extremely unbalanced in proportion. Under low and medium autodeposition rates, the best control of the evolution of the pathogen was achieved by mixing two components in roughly equal proportions. The magnitude of aggressiveness at equilibrium increased as autodeposition rates increased. Though the level of initial resistance of mixture components did not have an impact on the aggressiveness of pathogens at equilibrium, it strongly influenced the transient values of aggressiveness and therefore the total amount of disease caused over an evolutionary period. The cost to the pathogen of alloinfection and benefit of autoinfection per se did not affect the final level of aggressiveness, but did affect the time to reach equilibrium. However, the ratio of the cost to the benefit did influence the final aggressiveness of the pathogen.	"[Marshall, B.; Newton, A.

The loss of nitrogen and phosphorus in agricultural systems can cause the eutrophication of natural water bodies. In this paper, a field simulated rainfall experiment was conducted in a typical small watershed of the Danjiang River to study the nutrient loss process of nitrogen and phosphorus in slope croplands subjected to different crops and tillage measures. The characteristics of the runoff process and nutrient migration of different slope treatments were studied, which were the bare-land (BL, as the control), peanut monoculture (PL), corn monoculture (CL), bare land (upper slope) mixed with peanut monoculture (lower slope) (BP), corn and peanut intercropping (TCP), corn and soybean intercropping (TCS), downslope ridge cultivation (BS) slope, and straw-mulched (SC), respectively. The results showed that the runoff of CL, SC, TCS, BS, BP, PL and TCP slope types were 93%, 75%, 51%, 39%, 28%, 12%, and 6% of the those of the bare land, respectively. The total nitrogen concentration in runoff on different slope types decreased in the order of BP > PL > BS > SC > TCP > BL > CL > TCS. The BL was characterized with the highest NRL-TN (the loss of total nitrogen per unit area), with the value of 1.188 kg/hm(2), while those of the TCP is the smallest with the value of 0.073 kg/hm(2). The total phosphorus concentration in runoff decreasd in the order of BS > BP > PL > BL > TCP > SC > CL > TCS. The PRL-TP (the loss of total phosphorus per unit area) of BL is the largest (0.016 kg/hm(2)), while those of TCP is the smallest (0.001 kg/hm(2)). These indicate that the loss of nitrogen is much higer than that of phosphorus. The loss of nitrogen in runoff is dominated by nitrate nitrogen, which accounts for 54.4%-78.9% of TN. Slope croplands in the water source area should adopt the tillage measures of TCP and PL. These measures can reduce 85% of the runoff of nitrogen and phosphorus compared to the bare land. The results may assist in agricultural non-point source pollution control and help promote improved management of the water environment in the Danjiang River's water source area.

The study was a factorial experiment based on a randomized complete block design with three replications: the first factor was the ratio of safflower (Carthamustinctorius L. Pi cv.) to bean (Phaseolusvulgaris L. Saiad cv.) at five levels (safflower and bean sole cropping, and intercropping of safflower and bean at ratios of 1:3, 2:2 and 3:1); and the second factor was weed management at two levels: weed-free (complete weed control) and weedy (no weed control). The results showed that an intercropping system was the most appropriate method for decreasing the adverse effect of weeds on the performance of both crops. Intercropping was more suitable for weedy than weed-free conditions. According to the land equivalent ratio (LER) value, if the main crop was bean, the best intercropping treatment was one row of safflower and six rows of bean (S1B3) under both weedy and weed-free conditions. By contrast, if the main crop was safflower, the best treatment under weedy conditions was S1B3, whereas under weed-free conditions the best treatment was two rows of safflower and four rows of bean (S2B2).

At crop killing, the clover biomass contained 28-151 kg N ha(-1). Cover cropping did not change canola N uptake but increased yield and had a mineral fertilizer replacement value of 22-82 kg N ha(-1). Without N fertilizer application, CCs increased canola yields by 6%-42%, diminishing with increasing fertilizer N rate. Canola N uptake and yield were lower with pig slurry compared with the mineral fertilizer. Maximum canola yield was reached at rates of 120 kg N ha(-1) and higher with the mineral fertilizer. Therefore, clover CCs may help reducing fertilizer application rates in canola without compromising yields.

During first year's trial, garlic cloves of four cultivars (G026, G025, and G087 for the harvest of bulbs) were intercropped between two rows of pepper seedlings (cv. Golden Pepper) on each bed. Similarly, garlic bulb (cv G064 for the harvest of green seedlings) was sandwiched between two rows of pepper seedlings. During 2 nd year, the pepper crop was transplanted on the same beds already having garlic in the field of previous crop, following the same geometry. Sole pepper was grown as control. Both crops received uniform fertilization and irrigation as per requirements of pepper. Results revealed that concentration of soil bacteria and actinomycetes was higher respectively after one month of garlic intercropping during both the years of study as compared to the sole pepper; however, fungal population exhibited a diminishing trend. Soil protective enzyme activity (invertase, urease, and alkaline phosphatase) also showed dynamic changes after the intercropping of garlic. The principal soil nutrients (NPK) attained higher levels in pepper-garlic co-growth treatments as compared to the sole pepper The intercropping with green garlic (cv. G064) resulted highest nutrient levels suggesting that the effect might be cultivar specific. It was concluded that the intercropping of pepper with garlic enhances the soil fertility by changing nutrient levels, enzymatic activity and the soil microbial population. Overall, the pepper-garlic intercropping model provides a cost effective and eco-friendly organic farming system for vegetable growers.

Studies have suggested that, in host mixtures, such selection could increase the reproduction rate of simple pathotypes that always develop on the same host genetic background, whereas complex pathotypes should not be affected because they infect different host genotypes. In our experiment, the Erysiphe graminis population reproduced for successive generations on cvs. Orkis and Etecho, either grown as pure stands or in a mixture. In an additional treatment, the host cultivar changed after each generation. Isolates were sampled in April and, after seven pathogen generations, in July. At the second sampling date and for pure stands only, mean spore efficacy was greater on the host from which isolates were sampled than on the other one. This was attributed to selection within the pathogen population for better spore efficacy on the host genetic background. This selection was independent of the virulence genes carried by the isolates. The possibility of a phenotypic plasticity effect was tested and rejected.

Evaluation of cropping activities in the Adarsha watershed project, southern India	FOOD SECURITY			English	Article						"Watershed programmes; Crop production; Sustanability; Semi-arid tropics"		Baseline data and data taken both during and after a watershed development program, recording cropping activities in a semi-arid watershed in Telangana, India, were analyzed. Watershed development contributed to the sustainable yield improvement of dryland crops by rehabilitating the productive capacity of the land through water and soil conservation techniques. On the basis of long-term data collected from farm households in the watershed, we explored ways to increase crop productivity and sustainability. Investment in soil and water conservation significantly impacted agricultural development, most particularly during droughts. Farmers realized returns to land amounting to US $720 ha(-1) from cotton, $295 ha(-1) from flowers, $287 ha(-1) from vegetables and $171 ha(-1) from cereals. Mean returns to labour, irrespective of crop strategies, was $10 per person-day. Irrigation facilities in the watershed encouraged the growing of water-intensive crops but dryland crops were also more profitable as various in-situ and ex-situ interventions increased soil-moisture, providing congenial conditions for them. The responses were best during the watershed intervention period: yields of maize intercropped with pigeonpea were increased by 148 %, pigeonpea 100 %, sole sorghum 91 % and cotton 76.2 %. While droughts reduced the average share of household crop income in the non-watershed area from 44 to 12 %, this share remained unchanged at about 36 % in the watershed area. We deduce that watershed interventions have a positive influence on building resilient crop production.	"[Anantha, K.

Walp.] is a vital component of traditional cropping systems in the subtropics and tropics, grown both for high-protein grain and nutritious fresh leaves. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of (i) cropping regime and (ii) leaf harvesting initiation time and frequency on yield and yield components of dual-purpose cowpea. Studies were conducted at the Kenya National Dry land Research Center-Katumani over four seasons. Cowpea cultivar 'K80' was grown as a monocrop or intercropped with maize. Leaf harvesting was initiated at 2, 3, or 4 wk after emergence (WAE) and thereafter done at 7- or 14-d intervals. Control plants remained intact with no leaf harvesting. The number of lateral stems per plant, pods per plant, seeds per pod, unit seed weight, and vegetable and grain yields were monitored throughout each season, and plant productivity was found to be lower in intercropped than in monocropped cowpea. Leaf harvesting reduced all yield components. Initiating leaf harvesting at 3 and 4 WAE resulted in the highest leaf and grain yields, respectively. Harvesting leaves at a 7-d interval was associated with higher leaf yield, while a 14-d interval led to higher grain yield. Overall, yields were highest under treatments with no leaf harvest and lowest when leaf harvesting was initiated 2 WAE. Results of this study can help dual-purpose cowpea growers optimize yields according to their production goals.

Duch.) with broad bean (Vicia faba L. cv. Lara) and their similarities to different nitrogen concentrations, this field study was conducted for three years. The overall efficiency of intercropping was measured by using Land Equivalent Ratios (LERs). In intercropping plots, broad bean seeds were sown in the middle of strawberry rows. Meanwhile strawberries and broad beans were also grown as sole crops based on identical experimental design. Nitrogen was applied at three different rates (0, 80, and 160 kg/ha) in both sole and intercrop plots of strawberry. Sole cropping broad beans grown with no fertilizer-N application were considered the control. As a result of these studies, it was reported that the chemical characteristics such as ascorbic acid, total soluble solid, and titratable acidity of strawberry fruits were not significantly affected by either intercropping or nitrogen fertilization. While cropping system did not have any negative effects on fruit weight, fruit weight per plant, and yield of strawberry, nitrogen application rate did significantly affect these parameters. The 80 kg/ha nitrogen application gave maximum amount of marketable fruits for strawberry in both sole cropping and intercropping. Cropping system interaction with nitrogen application showed significant differences in fruit weight per plant and total fruit weight of strawberry. Intercropping caused some phenotypic alteration such as increasing height and growth habits of broad bean. However, there were no significant reductions in pod numbers, pod weight per plants and total yield of intercropped broad bean at 80 kg/ha nitrogen application as compared with sole cropping. Strawberry intercropped with broad bean at 80 kg/ha nitrogen gave the best LER values, indicating that intercropping might be more productive than sole cropping especially in case of 80 kg/ha nitrogen application.

Determining the relative importance of radiation interception models to the specific outputs could assist in developing suitable model structures, which fit to the theory of light interception and promote model improvements. Assuming an intercropping system with a taller and a shorter crop, a variance-based global sensitivity analysis (EFAST) was applied to three radiation interception models (M1, M2 and M3). The sensitivity indices including main (S-i) and total effects (STi) of the fraction of intercepted radiation by the taller (f(taller)), the shorter (f(shorter)) and both intercrops together (f(all)) were quantified with different perturbations of the geometric arrangement of the crops (10-60 %). We found both ftaller and fshorter in M1 are most sensitive to the leaf area index of the taller crop (LAI(taller)). In M2, based on the main effects, the leaf area index of the shorter crop (LAI(shorter)) replaces LAI(taller) and becomes the most sensitive parameter for fshorter when the perturbations of widths of taller and shorter crops (W-taller and W-shorter) become 40 % and larger. Furthermore, in M3, ftaller is most sensitive to LAI(taller) while fshorter is most sensitive to LAI(shorter) before the perturbations of geometry parameters becoming larger than 50 %. Meanwhile, LAI(taller), LAI(shorter), and K-taller are the three most sensitive parameters for fall in all three models. From the results we conclude that M3 is the most plausible radiation interception model among the three models.

Intercropping systems contribute to the optimization of land use, fostering sustainable and efficient agriculture. This study entails a first-year comparative intercropping assay using cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and melon (Cucumis melo) under organic management with different patterns and 30% less organic fertilization than usual in monocrops. We determined the soil nutrients, physicochemical properties, enzyme activities and microbes by high-throughput sequencing. We found that the intercropping system changed the bacterial community structure independently of the intercropping pattern. The bacterial community was characterized by a higher abundance of the phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla and of the genus Pseudomonas, which are related to nutrient cycling, and by greater amounts of other beneficial microorganisms like Bacillus, Streptomyces and Sphingomonas. The intercropped systems significantly boosted the total nitrogen, available phosphorus and total organic carbon levels in addition to the melon yield. They also enhanced the acid phosphatase and beta-glucosidase activity compared to the melon monocrop. Results from this study suggest that melon/cowpea intercropping, starting from the first year, not only provides a stable supply of food and income due to the diversified cropping systems, but is also beneficial for the soil microbial community and environment.

A socio-economic model of farmers' decisions on intercropping as an indicator for overall crop diversity was developed. The study was conducted between November 2009 and March 2010 in five districts in Tanzania, which were selected on the basis of the coconut's economic importance, using structured questionnaires which were administered to 200 household heads. Respondents were categorized in three groups - resource-poor farmers (43% of sample), medium-level farmers (50%) and well-off farmers (7%) according to six criteria. More than 80% of farmers were aware of the negative effects of the coconut mite. The result further indicated that the damaged nuts cause a loss of more than 30% of the cash income from coconut. Intercropping coconut with cassava, maize, cashew nut, sorghum and pineapples were the alternatives used by farmers to cope with declining coconut production caused by coconut mite and lethal yellowing disease. Land ownership and size, income from crops, non-farm income and family size were the main factors that influenced the farmer's decision to diversify crops.

In this study, we compared tomato/garlic intercropping with tomato monoculture and investigated the differences in the physicochemical properties of the medium, as well as the growth, yield and quality of spring tomato, under plastic tunnel organic medium cultivation during the year 2011-2012. The results showed that the pH value was higher and the EC value was lower in the intercropping medium than in the monoculture medium. The alkaline hydrolysis content of the intercropping medium did not change significantly over the tomato growth period, but available phosphorus and available potassium were both reduced continuously. The alkaline phosphatase and cellulase activities were both higher in the intercropping medium, while urease activity was lower. The invertase activity in the intercropping medium was significantly lower than in the monoculture medium before tomato transplanting but showed a nonsignificant difference at the fruit set stage of the tomato. The total microorganism population decreased for a short period after the garlic harvest in the intercropping medium but recovered to the level of the monoculture (control) at fruit set stage of the tomato. Intercropping increased the bacterial and actinomycetous populations but decreased fungal population in comparison to monoculture. The intercropped garlic inhibited the growth of the spring tomato, but this inhibition decreased after the garlic harvest. The chlorophyll contents in the leaves were increased, but the photosynthetic rate was decreased, for the intercropping spring tomato compared to the monoculture tomato. The tomato fruit quality, in terms of the titratable acid, vitamin C and dry matter contents, was significantly higher in the intercropping system, while the solid matter, soluble protein and soluble sugar contents did not differ significantly between the two methods. Intercropping reduced the total spring tomato yield but produced a higher net income than did monoculture. In conclusion, intercropping garlic with tomato can improve both the microorganism populations and the enzyme activity of the medium, which together reduce the obstacles of continuous tomato production.

Hence, we evaluated two methods of Bt-cotton establishment [transplanted cotton (TPC) & DSC)] at three planting geometries/densities in four Bt-cotton based cropping-systems [DSC-wheat (DSC-W), TPC-wheatmungbean (TPC-W-M), DSC-onion (DSC-O), TPC-onion-fodder cowpea + fodder maize (TPC-O-FC + FM)] in semi-arid region of south Asia. Poly-glass nursery-raised TPC exhibited significantly higher germination (96.5%), seedling-survival (96.1%) and 14.1% higher plant-stand owing to lower seedling-mortality (3.2%). TPC used similar to 60% less irrigation-water but exhibited significantly higher seed-cotton, seed and lint yield, net-returns, radiation-use-efficiency and water-productivity by 11.4, 9.9, 14.3, 17.3, 10.7 and 260.6%, respectively over DSC. Planting geometry/density of 60 x 45 cm (37,037 plants ha(-1)) exhibited significantly higher crop and water productivity and economic-returns. Bt-cotton transplanting led system-intensification enhanced the systemproductivity (26.1%), profitability (30.5%), water-productivity (19.3%) and land-use-efficiency (8.5%) over the DSC-based systems with significantly higher values under TPC-O-FC + FM. Energy-use pattern reveled that farm inputs viz. Fertilizers (54-60%), water (15-25%) and diesel (6-10%) consumed bulk of the input-energy in different cropping systems with greatest values under TPC-O-FC + FM. TPC-W-M exhibited highest system energy-output (604.6 x 10(3) MJ ha(-1)) and energy-returns (566.2 x 10(3) MJ ha(-1)). TPC-O-FC + FM exhibited significantly higher carbon-consumption (668.9 kg CE ha(-1)) and carbon-output (21431.3 kg CE ha(-1)) while maintaining significantly higher carbon-efficiency (32.0) and carbon sustainability index (31.0). TPC-O-FC + FM had least carbon-footprints (0.07 kg CE kg(-1) SCEY) while conventional-CWCS exhibited 2-folds higher carbonfootprints. Legume-imbedded TPC-based cropping systems markedly increased the soil physical (bulk-density, water-stable-aggregates), chemical (SOC, available-NPK) and biological properties (soil-microbial-biomass-carbon, dehydrogenase and ergosterol activity) over the conventional CWCS and DCS-O systems. Overall, Bt-cotton transplanting led system-intensification upholds great importance in enhancing the system crop and water-productivity, profitability, energy-productivity, resource-use-efficiency and soil-health with minimal carbonfootprints in semi-arid agro-ecosystems of south Asia.

Intercropping-Evaluating the Advantages to Broadacre Systems	AGRICULTURE-BASEL			English	Review						"sustainable agriculture; intercropping metrics; land equivalent ratio; broadacre agriculture"	"LAND EQUIVALENT RATIO; CROP DIVERSIFICATION; ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT; EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS; YIELD ADVANTAGE; MAIZE; WHEAT; NITROGEN; MIXTURES; PEA"	Intercropping is considered by its advocates to be a sustainable, environmentally sound, and economically advantageous cropping system. Intercropping systems are complex, with non-uniform competition between the component species within the cropping cycle, typically leading to unequal relative yields making evaluation difficult. This paper is a review of the main existing metrics used in the scientific literature to assess intercropping systems. Their strengths and limitations are discussed. Robust metrics for characterising intercropping systems are proposed. A major limitation is that current metrics assume the same management level between intercropping and monocropping systems and do not consider differences in costs of production. Another drawback is that they assume the component crops in the mixture are of equal value. Moreover, in employing metrics, many studies have considered direct and private costs and benefits only, ignoring indirect and social costs and benefits of intercropping systems per se. Furthermore, production risk and growers' risk preferences were often overlooked. In evaluating intercropping advantage using data from field trials, four metrics are recommended that collectively take into account all important differences in private costs and benefits between intercropping and monocropping systems, specifically the Land Equivalent Ratio, Yield Ratio, Value Ratio and Net Gross Margin.

We set up a farm experiment to test a wheat-Persian clover temporary intercropping system (Pcw, unfertilized wheat sown at 330 seeds m(-2), and clover sown in paired rows; Pcwbc, unfertilized wheat sown at 330 seeds m(-2), and clover broadcast sown) against a farm system control treatment (Ctrl, fertilized wheat as a sole crop sown in single rows at 440 seeds m(-2)) and a factorial control treatment (Ctrlpr, unfertilized wheat as a sole crop, sown in paired rows at 330 seeds m(-2)). Persian clover in Pcw/Pcwbc was incorporated into the soil at the wheat stem elongation phase. At early stages, wheat biomass and nitrogen accumulation in Pcw/Pcwbc was significantly lower than in Ctrl; the same parameters were lower in Pcw/Pcwbc compared to Ctrlpr, but not significantly different. At harvest, wheat grain yield in Pcw was not significantly reduced compared to Ctrlpr, but it was around 20% lower than in Ctrl. Grain yield and N accumulation in Pcwbc at harvest were lower than Ctrl and Ctrlpr. Wheat grain protein content was 16% and 24% higher in Pcw and Pcwbc, respectively, than in Ctrlpr, and 15% and 28% compared to Ctrl. None of the treatments was economically viable from a farming perspective, although Pcw showed less economic losses, as the higher protein level raises the grain prices. Overall, the insertion of Persian clover in a temporary intercropping system reduces grain yield compared to wheat customarily sown, while simultaneously improving wheat grain protein content. No clear indication on the effect of intercropping on weed dynamics can be given."

An overlooked local resource: Shrub-intercropping for food production, drought resistance and ecosystem restoration in the Sahel	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"Shrub-intercropping; Guiera senegalensis; Millet; Peanut; Groundnut; Drought"	"KARITE VITELLARIA-PARADOXA; NERE PARKIA-BIGLOBOSA; MILLET PENNISETUM-TYPHOIDES; SEMIARID WEST-AFRICA; PEARL-MILLET; NATIVE SHRUB; ORGANIC-MATTER; CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; PILIOSTIGMA-RETICULATUM; GUIERA-SENEGALENSIS"	The Sahel is at the nexus of extreme ecological, socio-economic, and food security challenges where Green Revolution technologies have not been adopted and yields remain unchanged since the 1960s. Although the Parkland system where trees are maintained in cropped fields can have positive ecosystem outcomes, there is limited success for increasing yields at the landscape level. Here we report on a long-term study of inter-cropping with a local and overlooked evergreen shrub, Guiera senegalensis that offers a new approach to remediate degraded soils and increase crop productivity. A long-term factorial split-plot experiment of an optimized G. senegalensis intercropping system (similar to 1500 shrubs ha(-1) with coppiced residue additions to soils) compared to sole-cropping (as the main plot treatment) under four fertilizer treatments (0-1.5 times the recommended NPK rate) (as sub-plot treatment) was conducted relative to edaphic and agronomic performance of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) in Senegal, West Africa. Contrary to conventional perspectives, G. senegalensis was non-competitive and indeed when coppiced there was a temporal offset of its fine root growth to the late rainy season when crop nutrient and water requirements are diminishing. The G. senegalensis intercropping system significantly increased crop yields, notably for millet where yields averaged across fertilizer treatments increased 126%. Importantly this system, over sole-cropping, maintained yields in low rainfall years which coincided with this system having significantly greater water use efficiency for both millet and groundnut. These responses were related to improved soil quality (increased particulate and total organic matter, and extractable nutrients). An important finding was that this system keeps surface soil temperatures below the critical 35 celcius, plant-physiological threshold during crop establishment which greatly improves crop emergence and early season growth. We conclude that this optimized shrub-intercropping system with its ability to produce abundant biomass (unpalatable to livestock) and unique ecological adaptation to coppicing, provides a logical approach for increasing food security and mitigating climate change. It is a local resource which subsistence farmers can directly utilize without external inputs or new infrastructure.	"[Bright, Matthew B.

Nevertheless, the extent of the effect of cereal/legume intercropping on nodulation and N fixation of intercropped legumes in root interaction requires extensive verification. In the present study, root interaction of alfalfa/triticale intercropping was simulated in pots with the use of root separation types (pot with no barrier (A-T), pot with nylon mesh barrier (NA-T), pot with plastic barrier (PA-T), and alfalfa alone (SA)) in pots. Moreover, the experiment was measured at a range of N levels (N-21, N-210) and growing stages (branching, budding and initial flowering stages) in growth chamber. As alfalfa was growing, the total nodule number (TNN), effective nodule number (ENN) and nitrogenase activity (NA) of alfalfa with A-T and other cropping systems more noticeably differed from each other at higher N levels, whereas their diversification was reduced at lower N levels. As alfalfa was growing continuously, fresh nodule weight per plant (PNW) and single fresh nodule weight (SNW) with A-T and other cropping systems were amplified more significantly. The nodulation and N fixation ability under N-21 were more significant than those under N-210. Dry weight of plant per pot (TDW) and nitrogen accumulation of plant per pot (TNA) with A-T were obviously higher than those with other systems in the initial flowering stage, except for TNA under N-21yy. The parameters regarding the nodulation and N fixation ability were significantly positively correlated on the whole. However, SNW and TNA were not significantly correlated, neither were SNW and TDW. According to the mentioned results, the closer root interaction, the better the nodulation form and N fixation ability of alfalfa will be, and the higher the biomass and N accumulation of all plants in pots will be. Interspecific facilitation in alfalfa/triticale intercropping system resulted in a greater yield and N accumulation; it also ultimately enhanced nodulation and N fixation ability, which can be applied in sustainable systems to avoid N loss to the environment and enhance N use efficiency."

There is a time conflict of four to six weeks between harvesting of wheat and sowing of Bt cotton. Relay-intercropping of cotton in wheat crop near to maturity could help to resolve the conflict. The information regarding the effect of relay-intercropping on growth and quality of cotton is scanty. This two-year study compared the growth and fiber quality of relay-intercropped Bt cotton (sown in early/late March) in standing wheat crop with conventionally-tilled (CT) cotton planted after wheat harvest in late April. The relay-intercropped cotton was sown on ridges/beds in wheat, whereas CT cotton was sown after wheat harvest in late April or sown on fallow land in early or late March at Multan and Vehari sites. The CT Bt cotton grown on fallow land in early March had the best performance as indicated by plant growth and fiber quality. However, the relay-intercropped Bt cotton in bed-sown wheat had better growth and fiber quality than the CT cotton planted after wheat harvest in late April. At both sites, the taller plants and higher biomass production were recorded in relay-intercropped Bt cotton in bed-sown wheat in early March as compared with the CT cotton sown after harvest of flat-sown wheat in late April. Fiber firmness, its uniformity, length and strength were also improved in the relay-intercropped Bt cotton in bed-sown wheat in early March as compared to CT cotton sown after wheat harvest in late April. In conclusion, relay intercropping of Bt cotton in the standing wheat during early March improved plant growth and fiber quality in cotton-wheat cropping system.

In addition, compared with sole cropping systems, intercropping is a promising approach for the crop production due to its lower reliance to chemical fertilizers. In this study, grain yield of soybean and biomass, chemical compositions and antioxidant activity of dragonhead essential oil in sole crop and dragonhead-soybean intercropping system under organic and chemical fertilizers were investigated. Land equivalent ratio (LER) was calculated as well. Results indicated intercropping and application of organic manure, increased soybean grain yield and dragon head biomass. The LER value for soybean: dragonhead with ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 under organic manure was greater than 1, indicating superiority of intercropping versus sol crop systems. GC-MS analysis showed that geranial, geranyl acetate, neral and piperitone were major compounds of dragonhead. The geranial and neral contents were increased in sole cropped dragonhead with application of chemical fertilizer, while the piperitone content was enhanced in sole cropped plants fertilized with organic manure. The highest of geranyl acetate content was observed in intercropped dragonhead plants fertilized with chemical fertilizer. Addition of organic manure lead to increase the antioxidant capacity of dragonhead in intercropped plots. The highest antioxidant activity of dragonhead (IC50 = 1.45 mu gmL(-1)) was observed in one row of soybean + two rows of dragohead treated with organic manure. Overall, one row of soybean + two rows of dragohead with use of organic manure was more productive and had the highest LER value, antioxidant activity and a large amount of chemical compositions of essential oil. Thus this treatment could be adopted by the medicinal plant growers for appropriate production of dragonhead.

Yield and Economic Potential of Spring-Planted, Pea-Barley Forage in Short-Season Corn Double-Crop Systems	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							"COVER CROP; NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION; UNITED-STATES; GROWTH-STAGES; RYE; WHEAT; INTERCROPS; MANAGEMENT; GRAIN; DATE"	Double cropping with forages can increase dry matter (DM) yield and N-use efficiency over sole-crop (SC) systems, but reductions in primary crop yield can limit economic return. This study assessed whether a double-crop (DC) system coupling a legume-cereal biculture forage with early maturing corn can reduce fertilizer N input and compete economically with SC corn. Biomass yield, N uptake, residual soil NO3-N, and economic net return were measured in two DC and one SC systems in four experiments conducted in Minnesota between 2014 and 2016. In DC systems, a fi eld pea (Pisum sativum L.)-barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) forage biculture was double cropped with a dual-purpose hybrid (DP) or semidwarf (SD) corn (Zea mays L.) variety. In SC systems, full-season hybrid corn (HC) was planted without preceding forage. Six fertilizer N rates (0-224 kg N ha(-1)) were applied to corn. Averaged across N rates, DP and SD corn yielded less (8.2 and 1.8 Mg DM ha(-1), respectively) compared to SC (16.4 Mg DM ha(-1)). Total system DM yield was similar for the DC-DP and SC-HC systems, averaging 16.6 Mg ha(-1). Economic return for the SC system was greater than that for the DC-DP system, and was maximized with 134 to 224 kg N ha(-1), while return for the DC-DP system was unaffected by N rate. Due to low corn yield and greater production cost, double cropping spring forage with short-season corn is not a profitable alternative to SC corn.	"[Raskin, Daniel; Wells, M.

As per the results averaged over 2 years, the different varieties and mixture ratios had significant effect on the forage yield and quality, and also the interactions for the characters studied were statistically significant. The highest Hungarian vetch rate (37.3%), green herbage (36.3 t ha(-1)) and crude protein (CP) yields (1510 kg ha(-1)) were obtained from the mixture of 80% Hungarian vetch (Tarm Beyazi-98) and 20% barley, the highest hay yield (10.5 t ha(-1)) was obtained from the mixture of 20% Hungarian vetch (Anadolu Pembesi-2002) and 80%barley. In terms of the forage quality parameters, such as crude protein rate (CPR), neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and relative feed value, except for the CPR (16%, in 80% Hungarian vetch (Tarm Beyazi-98)+20% barley combination), the most desirable results were assessed (54.6%, 31.3%, and 110%, respectively) from the mixture of 80% Hungarian vetch (Ege Beyazi-79) and 20% barley. The cultivar Tarm Beyazi-98 showed the highest forage yield among the tested cultivars of Hungarian vetch, while cultivar Ege Beyazi-79 had the highest forage quality. Moreover, despite the forage yield having been increased with the increasing barley seed ratio in the mixture, the forage quality significantly decreased concurrently. From the results of the study, it was concluded that the optimal values, both in yield and quality, were obtained from the 80% Hungarian vetch +20% barley intercropping system.

An intercropping system combining wheat and grain legumes may provide a farmwide production system that fulfills both economic and environmental concerns. We grew spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. 'Scarlet') as a monoculture and intercropped with either a common bean cultivar (Phaseolus vulgaris L. 'Red Kidney' or 'Black Turtle') or a fava bean cultivar (Vicia faba L. 'Bell') without fertilizer in rows of wheat/bean 1:1 and 2:1 as well as broadcast arrangements during 2011 and 2012 to assess the impact of different genera (Vicia and Phaseolus) and cultivars (Red Kidney or Black Turtle) on the wheat performance, land productivity, N and C accumulation in aboveground biomass, and soil mineral N balance. As baseline, the monoculture wheat plots yielded 3.2 t ha(-1). However, wheat-fava bean plots displayed higher land equivalent ratio (LER) and total land outputs (TLO) with increased land productivity of 50% in the 1:1 and 32% in the 2:1 arrangements. Intercropped plots in row arrangements also improved wheat biomass nitrogen and grain protein content compared with monoculture plots. Wheat-fava bean in the 1:1 arrangement accumulated the highest N (34 kg ha(-1), i.e., 176% higher) and organic C (2138 kg ha(-1), i.e., 26% higher) in shoot biomass compared with monocultured wheat. Both NH4+ and NO3- pools were higher in intercrop plots with the highest mineral N balance in wheat-fava bean in the 1:1 arrangement (+0.2 mg NH4+ and +1.1 mg NO3- kg(-1) dry soil). This study demonstrates that intercropping wheat with fava bean is an efficient strategy to increase land productivity while also increasing forage and soil quality.

Relay intercropping of forage legume cover crops in an established winter cereal crop might be a viable option but is still not well documented, especially under organic conditions. Four species of forage legumes (Medicago lupulina, Medicago sativa, Trifolium pratense and Trifolium repens) were undersown in six organic wheat fields. The density and aerial dry matter of wheat, relay-intercropped legumes and weeds were monitored during wheat-legume relay intercropping and after wheat harvest until late autumn, before the ploughing of cover crops. Our results showed a large diversity of aerial growth of weeds depending on soil, climate and wheat development. The dynamics of the legume cover crops were highly different between species and cropping periods (during relay intercropping and after wheat harvest). For instance, T. repens was two times less developed than the other species during relay intercropping while obtaining the highest aerial dry matter in late autumn. During the relay intercropping period, forage legume cover crops were only efficient in controlling weed density in comparison with wheat sole crop. The control of the aerial dry matter of weeds at the end of the relay intercropping period was better explained considering both legumes and wheat biomasses instead of legumes alone. In late autumn, 24 weeks after wheat harvest, weed biomass was largely reduced by the cover crops. Weed density and biomass reductions were correlated with cover crop biomass at wheat harvest and in late autumn. The presence of a cover crop also exhibited another positive effect by decreasing the density of spring-germinating annual weeds during the relay intercropping period. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In experiment I the crop was harvested when the peas were at the flat pod (cut 1) or full pod (cut 2) stage. At the first cut half of the forage was wilted and half was acid-treated with a 2:1 mixture of formic and propionic acid. At the second cut all of the forage was acid-treated. Voluntary intake was highest for the cut 2 silage. In experiment 2 the crop was harvested when the peas were at the flat pod (cut 1), pod fill (cut 2) or full pod (cut 3) stage. The crop was pre-wilted overnight and then acid-treated. Voluntary intake was highest for the cut 3 silage, a [though the in vivo apparent digestibility was lowest. Milk and protein yield increased with crop maturity. It was concluded that pre-wilting and acid treatment produces good quality, palatable pea-oat bi-crop silage.

Generally, intercropping was advantageous with a small reduction in rice yield and a substantial increase in yield of the legume. Pigeon pea-rice systems gave the highest intercropping advantage of 41-74% in the first year. In the second year, high intercropping advantages were recorded for cowpea and pigeon pea intercrops but the indeterminate pigeon pea cv. Hy3C reduced the expected rice yield by half. High irradiance early in the rainy season increased the growth and yield of both rice and legumes compared to the previous season, but intercrop rice was less competitive than Hy3C. Canopy cover of rice was slowest compared to cowpea and pigeon pea, largely because of the erect leaf arrangement of rice. Intercropping invariably increased the amount of radiation intercepted due to faster canopy cover, i.e., spatial complementarity. It was concluded that determinate legumes are more appropriate for intercropping with upland rice.

Linxia Dacandou) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L cv. 8354). These pots were separated into two compartments, either by a solid barrier to prevent root contact and N movement, by a nylon mesh (30 mum) to prevent root contact, but allow N exchange, or no root barrier between the compartments to allow root intermingling. Root contact enhanced N-15 acquisition of wheat but decreased that of fababean. Nitrogen derived from fertilizer (Ndff) by wheat was 73, 91 and 130 mg pot(-1) in the treatment with solid barrier, with mesh barrier and without barrier, respectively. For fababean, these values were 38, 25 and 8 mg pot(-1), respectively. Accordingly, increased competition from wheat roots resulted in a decrease in soil and fertilizer N uptake by fababean, and correspondingly, higher percentage of N derived from atmosphere N-2 (%Ndfa). The %Ndfa of fababean was 58%, 80%, and 91% in the treatment with solid barrier, with mesh barrier and without barrier, respectively. Nitrogen transfer from fababean to wheat was estimated by the indirect N-15 isotope dilution technique and by direct plant labeling via petiole injection of a N-15 solution. With the indirect method, N transferred from fababean to the associated wheat was 2 mg with a mesh barrier and 6 mg without barrier. Using direct labeling method, N transferred from fababean to companion wheat was 7 mg, equal to 15% of total N in wheat.

Field experiments were conducted from 2014 to 2016 in Lishu County, Jilin Province, China in order to evaluate alfalfa intercropping within the context of a uniform planting density of corn. The four treatments included corn monoculture (nC) as the control, 3-row corn intercropping with 3-row alfalfa cultivation (3C/3A), 3-row corn intercropping with 5-row alfalfa cultivation (3C/5A), and alfalfa monoculture (nA). Corn-alfalfa intercropping did not affect soil moisture in 2014. In 2015, the relative soil water content of the 3C/5A treatment was lower than that of the nC treatment, and the relative soil water content of the 3C/3A treatment was higher than that of the nC treatment. Biomass and yield under the 3C/5A treatment were greater than those under the nC treatment in a normal year (2014) and a wet year (2016). Biomass water use efficiency and net revenue under the 3C/5A treatment were similar with those under the nC treatment. Net revenue of the 3C/5A treatment was 14% higher than that of the nC treatment in a dry year (2015). Biomass, biomass water use efficiency, and net revenue under the 3C/5A treatment were higher than those under the 3C/3A treatment. The 3C/5A treatment was an effective planting pattern over the 3 years, with a total net revenue 443 USD ha(-1) higher than that of the nC treatment. The nA treatment's biomass and biomass water use efficiency were less than those of the nC treatment, but its economic benefit was highest among all treatments, with a total net revenue 2510 USD ha(-1) higher than that of the nC treatment. Therefore, planting alfalfa as a monoculture or as part of a 3C/5A intercropping system is recommended to improve soil fertility and the development of animal husbandry while financially benefiting farmers.

This experiment was done in order to estimate yield and yield components of forage corn (SC 704), intercropped by three cultivars of berseem clover on the basis of different nitrogen levels at Research Farm, Faculty of Agriculture, Islamic Azad University, Khorasgan Branch, Esfahan, Iran. Plant height, leaf fresh yield, stem fresh yield, total fresh yield, leaf dry yield, dry yield/fresh yield and total protein were significantly affected by cultivar. Nitrogen had significant influence on plant height, stem diameter, number of leaf, LAI, leaf fresh yield, stem fresh yield, total fresh yield, leaf dry yield, stem dry yield, total dry yield and total plant protein. Cultivar and nitrogen interaction had significant effect on leaf fresh yield, total fresh yield, leaf dry yield, total dry yield, dry yield/fresh yield and total protein in plant. On the basis of the results total fresh yield, total dry yield and total protein of plant were significantly increased by N addition from 0 to 60 kg/ha. Forage corn intercropped by Multicut also gave the highest total dry yield and total protein of plant, but the maximum total fresh yield was achieved in forage corn and Sacromont intercropping.

Tachinagaha weeded); CT (corn + soybean cv. Tachinagaha unweeded); CSW (corn + soybean cv. Suzukaren weeded); and CS (corn + soybean cv. Suzukaren unweeded). Parameters measured were plant height, yield, nutrient composition of corn and soybean and the numbers of Japanese beetles (Popillia japonica). Plant height of mono-cropped corn was significantly (P 0.05) greater than that of corn in most of the inter-cropped treatments. The number of Japanese beetles had increased dramatically, especially on unweeded inter-cropped treatments, at 55 DAS (days after sowing). Fresh and dry matter yields (FMY and DMY) of corn did not differ among treatments (P 0.05) than in CSW and CS. Weeding tended to reduce the number of Japanese beetles on soybean plants, but it did not affect yield of soybean in this study. Neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) concentrations in corn cobs, whole corn plants and whole soybean plants did not differ among treatments (P 0.05), while crude protein (CP) concentration in whole corn plants in CTW exceeded (P<0.05) those for mono-cropped corn and CSW treatments. These results indicated that soybean can be successfully inter-cropped with corn in southwestern Japan. Soybean plants may be infested with Japanese beetles. It is advisable to control weeds in the stands to reduce the level of beetle infestation and to minimize competition for the planted crops."

Inclusion of various pulse/oilseed/vegetables/cereals/medicinal/aromatic crops with sugarcane brings forth cultivation of these crops in irrigated agro-system and improves the yields of component crops. Besides, the component crops improve soil fertility and create a favorable environment for the further growth of sugarcane crops. Sprouting in winter-initiated sugarcane ratoon could be enhanced by adopting fodder legumes such as Indian clover and Egyptian clover. Intercropping vegetables provides an ample opportunity for mid-season income generation and improves profitability. Besides, high-value medicinal and aromatic crops such as tulsi (holy basil), mentha could also be included in the sugarcane-based system. Crop residue management has been recognized as a critical issue in managing the crops in the various cropping systems. Including multiple bio-agents for fast decomposition of crop residues provides scope for managing soil organic carbon through crop residue recycling in the system. Resource use efficiencies, nutrient use, water use, and weed control could be increased by adopting suitable crops in intercropping systems. An integrated farming system involving crop, livestock, and fisheries options could improve farmers' profit besides employment generation in rural India. Recycling of bye products and co-products of other enterprises influences the viability and farmer's profitability of the system. Trash, press mud cake, vinasse, composted bagasse, rhizodeposition of stubble play a significant role in sustaining soil fertility and increasing crop productivity. New emerging crop diversification options, viz., intercropping of rajmash, winter maize, and garlic in autumn cane generate mid-season income and enhance the system's profitability for small and marginal cane growers. Dual-purpose legumes, viz., cowpea, and green gram as intercrops with spring-planted cane increase the pool of soil microbial biomass nitrogen capitalize allelopathic effects and sustain soil health. In the present paper, these issues have been discussed. Due to the adoption of location-specific and farmers-centric systems, farmers' profitability could be increased, providing sustainability to the sugarcane-based systems.	"[Shukla, S.

In this experiment, 16 cultivars of non-climbing beans, including determinate and indeterminate types, were evaluated in sole crop and in association with bananas for three seasons in 1989 and 1990 to determine if selection of bean cultivars in monoculture can result in genetic progress for the banana-bean association. CultivarXcropping system interactions were not significant for bean seed yield and the components of yield. Rank correlation coefficients of cultivar seasonal mean yields in monoculture to the overall cultivar mean yields in association were high and significant ranging from 0.50 to 0.84. This was consistent with the lack of cultivarXcropping system interaction. Numbers of pods and seeds per plant were more closely associated with intercrop bean yield than sole-crop yield. The results of this research have shown that evaluation of non-climbing bean genotypes for seed yield in monoculture provides sufficient information to select cultivars efficiently for the banana-bean intercropping system.

This study aimed to identify weed composition and infestation in corn grown with different plant populations, single, and intercropped with palisade grass. The phytosociological method was used to evaluate density, frequency, dominance, and infestation level of weeds in single and intercropped corn, a with conventional (0.90 m) and reduced (0.45 m) spacing, and low and high plant population in Dourados, MS, Brazil. Commelina benghalensis, Echinochloa spp., and Euphorbia heterophylla were the species most found in the treatments. Single corn with higher plant population decreased weed occurrence. Treatments with palisade grass under a reduced spacing showed lower absolute weed infestation (about 75%) when compared to single corn. Weed infestation was lower in the intercropping of corn with palisade grass, with more pronounced effect under a reduced spacing.	"[Melo, T. S.; Makino, P.

The experiment was carried out in a randomized complete block design with nine cultivation systems and four replicates, in two crop seasons. In 2014/2015, forage grasses and legumes were evaluated, besides fallow treatments. In 2015/2016, forage and legume intercropped or not with corn or sunflower and fallow were assessed; the soybean crop was evaluated following cover crops. Phytomass, soil cover, and nutrient cycling provided by cultivation systems, as well as soybean mass and yield, were determined. Urochloa ruziziensis alone or intercropped, compared with the fallow systems, promotes significant increases in phytomass production, soil cover and nutrient cycling, with an increase in the grain yield of soybean planted in succession. N and K are the most accumulated nutrients in the aerial part of the cover crops and are released in larger quantities in the soil in the two years of evaluation. Crotalaria spectabilis promotes an increase in soybean yield in the 2015/2016 crop season, compared with U. ruziziensis, due to the synchronism between N release and uptake under no-tillage system."

Only C. canadensis intercropped with C. glomeratum, C. hirsuta intercropped with C. glomeratum, and three-species intercropping increased plant biomass compared with their respective monocultures. The treatments of C. canadensis intercropped with C. glomeratum and three-species intercropping increased the Cd contents in roots and shoots of C. canadensis, whereas the other intercropping treatments decreased or had no significant impact on Cd contents. As for Cd accumulation, the treatments of C. canadensis intercropped with C. glomeratum, C. hirsuta intercropped with C. glomeratum, and three-species intercropping increased Cd accumulation in a single plant compared with that of their respective monocultures, whereas other intercropping treatments decreased Cd accumulation in individual plants. Only the treatments of C. canadensis intercropped with C. glomeratum and C. hirsuta intercropped with C. glomeratum increased Cd accumulation in shoots of a single pot compared with that of their respective monocultures. Therefore, C. canadensis intercropped with C. glomeratum and C. hirsuta intercropped with C. glomeratum may improve the phytoremediation efficiency for Cd-contaminated soil.

The outcomes reported are specifically those that relate to beneficial soil quality and water retention attributes relative to conventional tillage-based soil management practices applied to the fodder barley livestock system, the dominant system in the zone. On-farm operational research was established to examine the impact of a barley (Hordeum vulgare) and vetch (Vicia sativa) rotation intercropped with atriplex (Atriplex halimus) and salsola (Salsola collina), under CA and conventional tillage agriculture, on the soil quality parameters and crop productivity. Preliminary results showed that CA had a positive effect on the soil quality parameters and crop performance. The soil moisture and hydraulic conductivity were higher under CA (p < 0.05), combined with improved productivity (grain and above-ground biomass) under specific crop mixes. The results suggest that despite the marginal nature of the zone, the use of CA is a viable option for the future of farmers' livelihoods within similar localities and agro-climates, given the benefits for soil moisture and grain and straw productivity. In addition, it is likely to positively impact those in marginal environments where both pastoralism and agro-pastoralism production systems co-exist and compete for crop biomass as a main source of livestock feed. The increase in grain and straw yields vis-a-vis improvements in biophysical parameters in the CA system relative to tillage agriculture does suggest, however, that the competition with livestock for biomass is likely to reduce over time, and farmers would be able to return increased levels of straw (as stubble and residue) as mulch, given improved biomass yields.

Response of Sesame to Intercropping with Groundnut and Cowpea	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS			English	Article						"Intercropping; land equivalent ratio; sesame; seed yield"	"MAIZE; NITROGEN; PRODUCTIVITY; FACILITATION; SORGHUM; CARBON; LEGUME; YIELD; SOIL"	Sustainable food production is one of the major challenges of the twenty-first century in the era of global environmental problems such as climate change, increasing population, and natural resource degradation. Therefore, intercropping approach to sustainable food production is the need of hour to overcome this global issue. Field experiments were conducted under rain-fed conditions for two consecutive rainy seasons (2015/2016-2016/2017) at North Kordofan Estate, Sudan, to investigate the effects of intercropping sesame with groundnut and cowpea on its growth, yield components, and Land Equivalent Ratio (LER). The experiment consisted of nine treatments: three sole crops of sesame (S), groundnut (G) and cowpea (C) and six spatial arrangements of 1S:1G or C, 1S:2G or C, and 2S:1G or C row/s of sesame with each groundnut and cowpea. The treatments were arranged in a Randomized Complete Block Design with four replications. The results showed that intercropping had a significant (P ) effect on most of the parameters measured in this study. For sesame, the treatment 2S:1G (two rows of sesame alternating with one row of groundnut) gave the best number of seeds per capsules (79 seeds). For groundnut, the intercropping 1S:1G had the highest number of pods per plant (11 pods) and seed yield (7 g/plant). The spatial arrangement 1S:1G was the best pattern in terms of land equivalent ratio with 1.6. From this study, for attaining the highest total crop yield per unit area of land, where there is no crop bias and the preference is to maximize land use, the practice of planting one row of sesame alternating with one row of groundnut is recommended.

Enhanced Plant Rooting and Crop System Management for Improved N Use Efficiency	ADVANCES IN AGRONOMY, VOL 146	Advances in Agronomy		English	"Review; Book Chapter"							"BIOLOGICAL NITRIFICATION INHIBITION; NITROUS-OXIDE EMISSION; AMMONIA VOLATILIZATION; UREASE INHIBITOR; CATCH CROPS; AZOSPIRILLUM-BRASILENSE; NITRATE CONCENTRATION; NUTRIENT-UPTAKE; COVER CROPS; SOIL CARBON"	Despite the significant inroads into increasing agricultural productivity in recent decades, nitrogen remains a key limiting factor for crop growth and yield. Though highly variable globally, the amount of reactive N added yearly onto cropland that is subsequently lost to the environment remains high. As such the interest in agronomic approaches to address this and improve nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is currently very high. Here, we have shown the combined approaches of management interventions such as no-till, intercropping with leguminous and grass species, use of nitrogen inhibitors, and combined crop-livestock systems offer considerable potential for enhancing NUE and are already being readily deployed in the tropics. Grass species such as Brachiaria in particular have demonstrated enormous potential via their deep root architectures to reduce losses by leaching. However, the potential for increases in NUE through interaction and association of the root systems with the soil microbial community via rhizodeposits remains a major area for future research. Increasingly it is recognized that truly enhancing NUE requires consideration of the whole system. Improving NUE is not simply a matter of how much fertilizer is used but also the need for a deeper understanding of the interactions between nutrients, plants, microbes, and soils under specific agronomic situations such as the integrated maize/grass-livestock systems that are now regularly employed in the tropics. This more holistic approach to the management of nitrogen offers considerable benefits that can hopefully be realized not only from an agricultural perspective but also from an environmental and socioeconomic view point.

On-farm diversity offsets environmental pressures in tropical agro-ecosystems: A synthetic review for cassava-based systems	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Review						"Food security; Land-sharing; Sustainable intensification; Crop diversification; Ecosystem services"	"LEGUME INTERCROPPING SYSTEMS; MOSAIC-VIRUS DISEASE; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; LAND-USE CHANGE; SOIL-EROSION; ECOLOGICAL INTENSIFICATION; CROPPING SYSTEMS; FOOD SECURITY; PRODUCTIVITY; BIODIVERSITY"	Ecosystem integrity is at risk across the tropics. In the quest to meet global dietary and market demands, tropical agro-ecosystems face unrelenting agricultural intensification and expansion. Agro-biodiversity can improve ecosystem stability and functioning, but its promotion in smallholder-based systems faces numerous practical hurdles. In the tropics, cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is cultivated on over 25 million hectares and features as the third most important source of calories. Cassava crops are often maintained by resource-poor farmers who operate on marginal lands, at the fringes of sensitive, biodiverse habitats. As traditional intercropping schemes are gradually abandoned, monoculture cassava systems face stagnating yields, resource-use inefficiencies and agro-ecosystem degradation. A global literature search identified 189 cassava intercropping studies, covering 330 separate instances of intercropping systems. We employed a vote-counting approach and simple comparative measure across a subset of 95 studies to document the extent to which intercropping sustains a bundle of ecosystem services. Across geographies and biophysical conditions, a broad range of intercrops provided largely positive effects on five key ecosystem services: pest suppression, disease control, land equivalency ratio (LER), and soil and water-related services. Ecosystem services were augmented through the addition of a diverse range of companion crops. Results indicated 25 positive impacts vs. 3 negative impacts with the addition of maize, 5 vs. 1 with gramineous crops, 23 vs. 3 with four species of grain legumes, and 9 vs. 0 with trees. Appropriate intercropping systems can help to strike a balance between farm-level productivity, crop resilience, and environmental health. Our work highlights an urgent need for interdisciplinary research and systems-level approaches to identify intensification scenarios in which crop productivity, provision of ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation, and human well-being are all balanced.

Intercropping garlic may effectively relieve this obstacle due to its allelopathic and antimicrobial effects. A two-growing season investigation was carried out during autumn 2009 to spring 2010 in plastic tunnel to determine the effects of intercropped garlic and green garlic on the overall growth of cucumber and soil biological properties. Results showed that green garlic exhibited the inhibitory effect on the growth of cucumber in spring cultivation 2010. Garlic cucumber intercropping system increased yield of cucumber differently depending on garlic cultivars, with only cv. G005 showing significant increase (13.4%). Intercropping systems were evaluated as a greater net benefit system as compared to monoculture cultivation. Populations of soil bacteria and actinomyces were stimulated, while fungi were inhibited under intercropping system. Activities of soil invertase, urease, and alkaline phosphatase were encouraged under intercropping system in spring cultivation 2010 compared with monoculture. The promotion effect of intercropped garlic on urease and alkaline phosphatase maintained till garlic harvest. These results suggest that intercropping system can improve soil biology environment and alleviate continuous cropping obstacle of cucumber at different levels.

Coupling of these two practices may further increase crop yields and land and water use efficiencies when an optimal spatial distribution of soil water contents (SWC), soil temperatures, and plant roots is achieved. However, this coupling causes the distribution of SWCs, soil temperatures, and plant roots to be more complex than when only one of these agricultural practices are used. The objective of this study thus was to investigate the effects of different irrigation treatments on spatial distributions of SWCs, soil temperatures, and root growth in a drip-irrigated intercropping field with plastic mulch. Three field experiments with different irrigation treatments (high T1, moderate T2, and low T3) were conducted to evaluate the spatial distribution of SWCs, soil temperatures, and plant roots with respect to dripper lines and plant locations. There were significant differences (p < 0.05) in SWCs in the 0-40 cm soil layer for different irrigation treatments and between different locations. The maximum SWC was measured under the plant/mulch for the T1 treatment, while the minimum SWC was measured under the bare soil surface for the T3 treatment. This was mainly due to the location of drippers and mulch. However, no differences in SWCs were measured in the 60100 cm soil layer. Significant differences in soil temperatures were measured in the 05 cm soil layer between different irrigation treatments and different locations. The soil temperature in the subsoil (15 25 cm) under mulch was higher than under the bare surface. The overlaps of two plant root systems in an intercropping field gradually increased and then decreased during the growing season. The roots in the 030 cm soil layer accounted for about 60%70% of all roots. Higher irrigation rates produced higher root length and weight densities in the 030 cm soil layer and lower densities in the 30100 cm soil layers. Spatial distributions of SWCs, soil temperatures, and plant roots in the intercropping field under drip irrigation were significantly influenced by irrigation treatments and plastic mulch. Collected experimental data may contribute to designing an optimal irrigation program for a drip-irrigated intercropping field with plastic mulch. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

They tend to use agricultural management without technical assistance, which degrades soil quality. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the carbon and nitrogen pools in the Quilombola areas under different soil management types. A crop sequence was evaluated in two native Cerrado areas: 1-Cerradao (NC1) and 2-Cerrado stricto sensu (NC2), as follows: planted pasture (PP1 and PP2); maize (M1 and M2); citrus-cassava intercropping (T1); and citrus monoculture (T2). The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design with five replicates, and the plots were composed by the management systems, and the subplots were soil layers 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, and 50-60 cm. Conservation cultivation practices in T1 increased total organic carbon (TOC) stock (173 Mg ha(-1)), compared with M1 (120 Mg ha(-1)) and PP1 under conventional management (105 Mg ha(-1)). Down to a soil depth of 20 cm, the total N (TN) stocks were 39% and 56% lower in NC1 and PP1, respectively, than under conventional management. In area 2, the TOC stocks were similar in all treatments (mean of 118 Mg ha(-1)), and the cumulative TN stock down to the 50-60 cm layer was 10 Mg ha(-1). In the 0-20-cm layer, the N stock decreased by 15% under M2, while increases of 10% and 12% were observed in T2 and PP2, respectively. These results confirm that conservation management practices can increase carbon and nitrogen storage."

Plants produce a myriad of structurally and functionally diverse metabolites that play many important roles in plant response to continually changing environmental conditions as well as abiotic and biotic stresses. To develop a clearer understanding of the effects of shade on soybeans at different growth stages, a comprehensive, three-year, stage-wise study was conducted. Leaf area, leaf thickness, stem diameter, chlorophyll contents, photosynthetic characteristics and other morphological and physiological features were measured along with biochemical assays for antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase, peroxidase and caralase and yield attributes of different soybean genotypes (Guixia 2, Nandou12, Nandong Kang-22, E61 and C103) under shading nets with 50% light transmittance. It was observed that early shading (VER1 and VER2) significantly decreased main stem length and main stem length/stem diameter. Later shading (R1R8 and R2R8) had significant effects on morphological characters such as branch number and pod height. In Nandou 12, the protein contents in plants shaded at R1R8, R2R8 and R5R8 were 9.20, 8.98 and 6.23% higher than in plants grown under normal light levels (CK), respectively, and the crude fat content was 9.31, 10.74 and 4.28% lower. The influence of shading in the later period on anatomy was greater than that in the earlier period. Shading reduced the light saturation point (LSP), the light compensation point (LCP) and the maximum photosynthetic rate (Pn(max)), and increased the apparent quantum yield (AQ). Shading also increased the antioxidant enzyme activity in the plants, and this increase was greater with early shading than late. The variability in the chlorophyll (a + b) content and the chlorophyll a/b ratio in R2 stage plants was less than in R5 stage (VER5) plants. Similarly, the activity of antioxidant enzymes in R2 after returning the plants to normal light levels (VER2) was lower than in R5 after relighting (VER5). Compared with later shading, the early shading had a greater effect on the photosynthetic and related characteristics. The longer the shading time, the greater the adverse effects and the less able the plants' were to recover. The data collected in this study contribute to an understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying the early and late growth stage acclimation strategies in different soybean genotypes subjected to shade stress.

J	"Rastogi, A; Singh, V"				"Rastogi, Akanksha; Singh, Vir"			Energy budget of Jatropha-based cropping systems in Tarai area of Central Himalayas, India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						"Energy budget; Intercropping system; Jatropha; Mustard; Soybean; Wheat"		The present investigation was carried out to work out energy budget of Jatropha auras L. sown exclusively and intercropped with three food crops, viz. wheat, mustard and soybean, in Pantnagar University farm at Tarai area of Himalayan foothills during crop season 2017. The results showed that the energy use efficiency expressed as the output-input energy ratio, was highest in case of wheat cultivated as a sole crop (6.76). When the wheat was intercropped with Jatropha, the output-input ratio declined to 4.20. Energy productivity (per ha basis) figures brought to the fore the fact that on investing one kJ the highest production was in case of wheat cultivated as a sole crop (18. 88 x10(-5) kg/kJ). The value decreased to 11. 74 x10(-5) kg/kJ in the Jatropha-wheat intercropping system. A trend of decrease in energy productivity of food crops in the Jatropha-based intercropping system revealed that these cropping systems were not favourable for harvesting more energy of useful production. Jatropha's own energy productivity (12. 40 x10(-5) kg/kJ) was comparatively lower than all the food crops raised as sole crops but relatively higher when the crops were raised with Jatropha. The figures of specific energy increased with the cultivation practice of Jatropha-based intercropping of food crops. The net energy values for wheat raised under both the systems surpassed the values for Jatropha and all other food crops. In case of each food crop, the values of net energy decreased on cultivation of the crop with Jatropha. We can arrive at the conclusion that the Jatropha-based intercropping is not a promising agronomic practice.

Intercropping of short duration crops in sugarcane could improve profitability and make it more attractive for growers. Sugarcane planted in the autumn season is more suitable for intercropping, as low temperature during winter slows down the growth of sugarcane plants. Therefore, suitability of short duration winter vegetables for intercropping in autumn planted sugarcane and the efficacy of herbicides for weed control in these intercropping systems was investigated over two years. Four cropping systems (sole sugarcane, sugarcane-cabbage, sugarcane-peas and sugarcane-garlic) and six weed control treatments were investigated during 2010-11 and 2011 -12. Intercropping of sugarcane with peas, cabbage and garlic produced cane yield (75.3-88.3 t ha(-1)) similar to sole sugarcane (76.1-86.0 t ha(-1)) and intercrop yields of 6.28-6.57 t ha(-1) for garlic, 7.45 -7.88 t ha(-1) for peas and 15.3-15.8 t ha(-1) for cabbage. The intercropping of these vegetables in sugarcane increased the net monetary returns by 1.74-2.66 fold as compared to sole sugarcane (USD 1648 ha(-1)). Sugarcane-garlic intercrop had the highest net monetary returns of USD 4384 ha(-1) and the highest benefit cost ratio of 2.45; net returns from intercropping of sugarcane with peas and cabbage varied from USD 2873-3094 ha(-1). Pre-emergence application of oxyfluorfen 0.234 kg ha(-1) and pendimethalin 0.75 kg ha(-1) provided similar level of weed control to hand-weeding, and increased the yield of cabbage, peas and garlic than the weedy check. The use of herbicides increased the net returns by USD 229-725 ha(-1) as compared to the weedy check. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Intercropping with grasses helps to reduce iron chlorosis in olive	JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION			English	Article						"Calcareous soils; gramineae; iron chlorosis; iron deficiency; intercropping; phytosiderophores"	"CALCAREOUS SOIL; ACQUISITION; RHIZOSPHERE; PHYTOSIDEROPHORES; PEANUT; PLANTS; ROOT"	"Grasses are more efficient than dicots in acquiring Fe from calcareous soils. We studied whether intercropping with grasses alleviates Fe chlorosis in olive and whether the effect persists in succeeding dicot crops. Three different pot experiments were conducted. In the first, olive plants were intercropped with 6 different grass species (purple false brome, annual ryegrass, compact brome, goatgrass, barley and red fescue); in the second, the two species best performing in the previous experiment were studied in various calcareous soils and; in the third, chickpea and peanut were grown in pots previously used to cultivate the two grasses. Intercropping with purple false brome and barley increased leaf chlorophyll concentrations and/or boosted growth of olive trees on three different calcareous soils. Olive growth was adversely affected by intercropping in one soil as a result of competition for water. Intercropping increased Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn leaf contents in olive. Also, grass cropping generally raised available levels of soil Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn; this effect, however, resulted in no substantial alleviation of Fe chlorosis in succeeding chickpea or peanut crops. Intercropping with purple false brome and barley appears to be a promising remedy for Fe chlorosis in olive orchards affected by Fe chlorosis."	"[Canasveras, J. C.; del Campillo, M.

INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL			English	Article						"economics; inorganic nitrogen; intercrop; legume; management; yield; sugarcane"	"COMMON VETCH; YIELD; COMPETITION; SYSTEMS; FORAGE; OAT"	The South African sugar industry recommends green manuring as a best management practice, but it can only be practised once every crop cycle (every 8-10 years). Intercropping was therefore investigated as a potential means of exploiting the benefits of green manuring over the entire sugarcane crop life. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of intercropping on cane yield, and to investigate the possibility of reducing inorganic nitrogen (N) inputs in the presence of a leguminous intercrop. Four trials, with soybean, cowpea and/or lupin intercrops, were conducted at sites in Paddock, Nkwaleni and Pongola. In total, nine crops were harvested from four trials. Different rates (0, 33, 67 and 100%) of the recommended N were applied to the cane. In seven of the nine crops harvested (78%), no significant yield differences existed between cane-only controls and cane grown with intercrops. The crop response to N was generally poor, with significant yield differences between the 0% and 100% N cane-only controls observed in only 44% of the crops harvested. Analyses of the results show that in most cases where a response to nitrogen was seen, a significant reduction in yield was noted due to intercropping. Economic analysis of one trial showed that growing a sugarcane monocrop made more economic sense than intercropping. Practical and management considerations involved with intercropping must also be taken into account when intercropping.	"[Ramouthar, P. V.; Rhodes, R.; Wettergreen, T.; Pillay, U.; Jones, M.

While in-conversion land may be grazed, it is effectively out of production in stockless farming systems, potentially resulting in a reduction in income and pressure on cash flow. The objective of this work was to investigate alternative conversion strategies for stockless farming systems that would provide some economic return during the conversion period. To meet this objective, the effects of seven conversion strategies on a subsequent organic winter wheat crop were investigated on a sandy loam and a sandy clay soil. The strategies were: (1) 2-years' red clover-ryegrass green manure; (2) 2-years' hairy vetch green manure; (3) red clover for seed production then a red clover-ryegrass green manure; (4) spring wheat undersown with red clover, then a red clover green manure; (5) spring wheat, then winter beans; (6) spring oats, then winter beans; (7) spring wheat undersown with red clover, then a barley-pea intercrop. Conversion strategies had a significant impact on organic wheat yield, which ranged from 2.8 to 5.3 t ha(-1). However, differences in yield were not directly related to the effect of conversion strategy on nitrogen availability or weed suppression, but to their impact on soil structure. Establishment was the main determinant of wheat yield, and 89% of the variation in establishment was explained by differences in soil structure and texture. When comparing organic cropping on different soil textures, the ease of cultivation and seedbed preparation on the sandy loam was more important than the additional nutrient retention of the sandy clay.

Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and oats (Avena sativa L.) were seeded as spring monocrops (SMC) and in binary intercrop (IC) mixtures with fall species including winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), fall rye (Secale cereale L.), winter triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack L.), biennial Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) and annual Westerwolds ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.). Fall species were also seeded as monocrops (FMC). Silage Spring harvest occurred when barley (early-silage cut) and oats (late-silage cut) reached soft dough stage and again late in the autumn. An additional deferred grazing (DG) treatment containing each one fall species was harvested once in the autumn. Mean ranking of spring herbage silage yield was Oat-SMC (100%) > Oat-IC (91%) > Barley-SMC (83%) = Barley-IC (78%) > late-cut FMC (53%) > early-cut FMC (42%) (P less than or equal to 0.001). SilageSpring herbage yield of IC combinations was similar, but FMCs containing annual ryegrass were 26% to 34% (P less than or equal to .01) greater than other treatments. Crude protein content (g kg(-1)) was 14 to 35% higher (P less than or equal to 0.001) in IC systems than the corresponding SMC. Neutraleutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) content (g kg(-1)) of barley based systems was 15 and 22% lower (P less than or equal to 0.001) than those with oats. Ranking and relative productivity for fall pasture was DG (100%) > early-cut FMC (67%) > late-cut FMC (49%) > Barley-IC (30%) > Oat-IC (24%) = Barley-SMC (14%) (P less than or equal to 0.001). Cropping systems that contained no spring cereal produced 2.37-fold higher (P less than or equal to 0.001) fall pasture yield than those with spring cereals. Among FMCs, ICs and DG systems, mean yield of ryegrass treatments were generally higher (P less than or equal to 0.05) than that of fall cereals.

Field studies were conducted in 1994/1995 and 1995/1996 to investigate the nature of forage crop-weed dynamics and to test the effect of single year forage crops on the density and community composition of annual weeds in a following field pea (Pisium sativum L.) test crop. Five spring-seeded forage treatments were compared with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain crops (with or without herbicides for grassy and broadleaved weeds): winter triticale (Triticosecale) (simulation grazed); spring triticale (silage); spring/winter triticale intercrop (silage, then simulation grazed); alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) (hay); sorghum-sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor [L.] Moench x Sorghum sudanese [Piper]) (hay); and a weedy fallow (silage). A fall rye (Secale cereale L.) grain crop and a sweet clover (Melilotis officinalis L.)/winter triticale double crop (hay, then simulation grazing) were included in the 1995/1996 trial. All forage systems were at least as effective as the sprayed wheat control in suppressing wild oat (Avena fatua L.); however, effects on other weeds, especially broadleaved species, were variable. Biennial crops provided the best early season weed control, while long-season systems such winter triticale and the triticale intercrop provided the best late season weed control. Forages shifted the weed community composition away from wild oar and green foxtail (Setaria viridis L. Beauv.) to a similar or greater extent than herbicide-treated wheat. Forage systems that did not provide season-long crop competition tended to have more broadleaved weeds. Some forage systems increased pea grain yield the following year (relative to the sprayed wheat control); however, forages alone did not eliminate the need for herbicides in the pea crop. Annual forages may play an important role in integrated weed management, especially for wild oat, however further research to refine forage-based weed management systems is needed."

Numbers of aphids and aphid predators in cotton isolated from other crops were compared with numbers where canola, wheat, sorghum (strip intercrops) and cotton were planted adjacent to each other and overlapped temporally. Aphid and predator populations were also monitored in the intercrop. The intercrops acted as a reservoir for predators during the non-cotton season; these intercrops 'relayed' aphid predators from canola and wheat in the winter to sorghum in the spring and finally to cotton in the summer. Averaged over the three years of the study, predator numbers in the intercrops were highest in sorghum and lowest in wheat. In ail years, canola had higher predator numbers than wheat, suggesting that it would be a better winter intercrop than wheat for enhancing predator numbers. Average aphid abundance was lower in relay intercropped cotton than in isolated cotted each year. The three-year average in relay intercropped cotton remained fewer than 193 aphids per leaf on any one sample date, but reached 490 aphids per leaf in isolated cotton. Seasonal abundance of aphid populations was bimodal in relay intercropped cotton, with peaks in early August and early September, while populations peaked only once in late August in isolated cotton. Average predator numbers were higher in relay intercropped cotton than in isolated cotton, and predators appeared in higher numbers earlier in the summer in relay intercropped cotton than in isolated cotton. Results from this study suggest that where cotton is grown without insecticides, relay intercropping aids the early arrival and continuous population increase of predators in cotton, thereby reducing numbers and postponing the initial population increase of the cotton aphid."

Legume/non-legume intercropping is a widely applied agricultural practice worldwide and is very important for the development of sustainable agriculture, especially for improving soil nitrogen (N) nutrients and reducing N application via biological N fixation by legumes. However, research on intercropping between rice and aquatic legumes has rarely been undertaken. To address this issue, a field experiment was conducted to investigate the apparent N balance in rice and water mimosa (Neptunia oleracea Lour.) intercropping systems. Planting pattern treatments, including rice monocropping and rice/water mimosa intercropping, were employed in the paddy field, and three N fertilizer application levels, zero N (ZN, 0 kg ha-1 N), reduced N (RN, 140 kg ha-1 N), and conventional N (CN, 180 kg ha-1 N), were applied for the two planting patterns. The results showed that compared with rice monocropping, the growth indicators of rice were higher in the rice/water mimosa intercropping system. N fertilizer facilitated rice growth, and water mimosa grew better but reduced the partial factor productivity of rice. Notably, the biological N fixation efficiency of water mimosa was the highest in the reduced N treatment. In addition, the soil N nutrients in the rice/water mimosa intercropping treatments were higher than those in the rice monocropping treatments. In contrast, apparent N loss in the monocropping treatments was higher than that in the intercropping treatments, and it also increased with more N fertilizer applied. Thus, intercropping with water mimosa could promote rice growth, enhance N input, improve soil N nutrients, and reduce N loss. Furthermore, based on the performance of rice monocropping treatment under the conventional N level and rice/water mimosa intercropping treatment under the reduced N level on crop growth, N fixation, soil N nutrients, N mineralization and loss, we suggest thatrice/water mimosa intercropping with a reduced N application level is a much better choice. Taken together, rice/water mimosa intercropping is an environmentally friendly practice that could decrease N fertilizer application, and may alleviate nonpoint source pollution in paddy fields.

Exploiting P-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) has been an emerging bio-solution for a higher rhizosphere P-availability, meanwhile the above- and below-ground interactions that PSB would trigger remain unclear over plant growing stages. We hypothesized that PSB effects on plant growth may be greater on root traits that positively links with aboveground physiology more than the commonly believed rhizosphere P bio-solubilization. In this study, five contrasting PSB (Pseudomonasspp.) isolates (low PSB1, moderate PSB(2)and PSB4 and high PSB(3)and PSB5 P-solubilizing capacity PSC) were used to investigate above- and below-ground responses in wheat fertilized with rock P (RP) under controlled conditions. Our findings show that all PSB isolates increased wheat root traits, particularly PSB(5)which increased root biomass and PSB(3)that had greater effect on root diameter in 7-, 15- and 42-day old plants. The length, surface and volume of roots significantly increased along with higher rhizosphere available P in 15- and 42-day old plants inoculated with PSB(4)and PSB2. Shoot biomass significantly increased with both PSB(2)and PSB5. Root and shoot physiology significantly improved with PSB1(lowest PSC) and PSB4(moderate PSC), notably shoot total P (78.38%) and root phosphatase activity (390%). Moreover, nutrients acquisition and chlorophyll content increased in inoculated plants and was stimulated (PSB2, PSB4) more than rhizosphere P-solubilization, which was also revealed by the significant above- and below-ground inter-correlations, mainly chlorophyll and both total (R = 0.75,p = 0.001**) and intracellular (R = 0.7,p = 0.000114*) P contents. These findings demonstrate the necessity to timely monitor the plant-rhizosphere continuum responses, which may be a relevant approach to accurately evaluate PSB through considering below- and above-ground relationships; thus enabling unbiased interpretations prior to field applications."

White cabbage cv. Minicole was intercropped with Trifolium repens (white clover) and Trifolium subterraneum (subterranean clover) as compared to the monocrop. During the season observations were made on pest population developments, especially of Mamestra brassicae L. (cabbage moth), Brevicoryne brassicae L. (cabbage aphid), Delia brassicae L. (cabbage root fly), and evaluation of caterpillar feeding injury. At harvest the yield in quantity and quality was determined to be able to assess the gross financial result. Intercropping effects in terms of suppression of oviposition and larval populations of various pests were found. Although no pesticides were used and competition reduced the weight, the quality of the intercropped cabbages lead to a better financial result compared to the monocropped cabbage crop. The results are discussed in the perspective of the practical implications in the context of IPM.

In a 3-year cropping sequence, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) intercropped with corn (Zea mays L.) may increase overall economic yield and land sustainability over either crop alone. The objective of this study was to assess overall productivity of a corn-alfalfa intercropping system and its effect on weed community. The study was conducted near Boone, IA, USA, from 2016 to 2018 and repeated from 2017 to 2019 to assess the effect of five treatments: alfalfa only, corn only, corn intercropped with alfalfa, corn intercropped with alfalfa with prohexadione (PHX) applied to alfalfa at the V8 corn stage, and spring-seeded alfalfa (corn in the seeding year followed by planting alfalfa the following year) on system productivity. Corn grain yield decreased by 23 to 26% when intercropped with alfalfa; PHX application did not affect corn or alfalfa yield. Alfalfa stand density under corn was reduced by 36 to 68% compared with alfalfa alone in the seeding year. Alfalfa forage yield in the first production year was the same among intercropped treatments and sole alfalfa. However, spring-seeded alfalfa had two to three times less yield than other treatments. Alfalfa stem density was greater in sole alfalfa than the intercropped studies in the seeding year, with fewer stems in successive production years. Alfalfa forage yield strongly correlated with stem density, stem height, and stage at harvest in the seeding year and first harvest of the first production year. Weed density inconsistently correlated with alfalfa biomass. In conclusion, establishing alfalfa in intercropping with corn can skip alfalfa low-yielding seeding year. Based on the findings of our experiment, future research on corn-alfalfa intercropping should focus on screening drought tolerant corn hybrids with vigorous root systems. Using an early-maturing corn hybrid, coupled with management practices such as appropriate N fertilization, may improve corn yield and the chances of success for this intercropping system."

However, there is no detailed information in the scientific literature about the biological and economic efficiency of coffee-macadamia intercropping. In this work, we evaluated the productivity and economic performance of Arabica coffee-macadamia intercropping under rainfed and irrigated conditions for 13 years (2006-2018) in Sao Paulo state, southeastern Brazil. In addition, some biological, economic, and competition indices were used to understand the complementarity of companion crops under the intercropping system. Irrigation significantly increased coffee (21%-40%) and macadamia (33%-44%) yields. Despite the greater values of aggressivity and dominance indices of macadamia over coffee crop have been calculated in the rainfed regime, intercropping with macadamia reduced more strongly coffee yield under irrigation. The higher values of land equivalent ratio (LER), land equivalent coefficient (LEC), percentage yield difference (PYD), income equivalent ratio (IER), and relative net return index (RNRI) indicated relatively higher benefits of intercropping under rainfed regime than under irrigation. The intercropping systems were more productive than monocrops, reaching 215% more yield, 3.2-fold more gross income under rainfed conditions. The synergy of the combined use of irrigation and intercropping technologies decreased the payback period and the highest values of coffee equivalent yield (CEY) and monetary advantage index (MAI) under irrigation indicated a cumulative effect on the profitability. Here, for the first time, we demonstrated the complementarity between Arabica coffee and macadamia under the intercropping system, at least up to 13 years after planting of the crops, and suggest that it may be a viable option to optimize the use of resources, food production, and ecosystem services, making agricultural profitability more sustainable and stable.

In the preliminary experiment, intercropping with E. prostrata and C. crepidioides promoted the growth and decreased the Cd content in roots and shoots of tomato seedlings. In the further experiment, intercropping with E. prostrata and C. crepidioides had the same effects on the growth and Cd content of tomato seedlings as the preliminary experiment. In the further experiment, when three plant species (E. prostrate, C. crepidioides and tomato) intercropping together, the root and shoot biomasses of tomato seedlings got the maximum, and the Cd content in tomato seedlings got the minimum. Compared with the monoculture of tomato, three plant species intercropping increased the root and shoot biomasses of tomato seedlings by 49.28% and 64.19%, respectively, and decreased the Cd contents in roots and shoots of tomato seedlings by 17.35% and 22.35%, respectively. Intercropping with E. prostrata and C. crepidioides also increased the photosynthetic pigment content and enhanced the antioxidant enzyme activity of tomato seedlings. For accumulator and hyperaccumulator plants, intercropping with tomato inhibited the growth of E. prostrata and C. crepidioides, while increased the Cd content in two plant species. Therefore, intercropping with E. prostrata and C. crepidioides could promote the growth and reduce the Cd uptake of tomato seedlings, and three plant species intercropping together was the best combination.

Legume intercropping and manuring are important measures to sustain fertility and enhance productivity of soil. Four wheat cultivars Inqlab-91, WL-886, 1076 & 41 grown in field either as mono crop or intercropped with chickpea (CM 88) were evaluated with respect to yield, nutrient (N & P) uptake, compatibility and profitability. Prior to establishment of experiment, soil was enriched by green manuring of vegetative biomass of legume cereal for the last two years to raise organic matter/nutrients contents sufficienctly for growing a crop without mineral fertilizer addition. In monoculture, wheat cultivar Inqlab-91 produced the maximum grain (3294 kg ha(-1)) than other wheat lines (WL). In intercropping system, one hactare of land produced a maximum grain yield of WL-1076 (2456 kg) along with additional chickpea grain yield (1302 kg) while an other association produced maximum grain yield of chickpea (1795 kg) along with additional wheat yield (2144 kg by Inqlab-91). Cumulative grain value (Rs. ha(-1)) in intercropping culture was two times higher compared to that of wheat mono cropping. Associated crops accumulated significantly higher N in their biomass with a maximum of 87 kg ha(-1) (by Inqlab+chickpea), compared to a maximum of 58 kg ha-1 by wheat (Inqlab-91) as mono culture. Phosphorus uptake by associated crops was also higher compared to wheat grown alone. The results clearly suggested superiority of wheat-chickpea co-cropping over wheat monoculture in terms of enhanced nutrient utilization, crop yield and farm income.

The subplot factorial consisted of two nodulation levels (nodulating and non-nodulating soybean), two N levels (200 and 400 mg N applied at planting, tagged with N-15), and four P levels (12.5, 25, 50 and 100% of normal nutrient concentration). All treatments were inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi. Complications resulted from differences in relative competitiveness for mineral N and from decreasing N-15 concentrations in shoots as P levels increased. The lower rate of N maximized nodulation and biomass and N yields in nodulating soybean, and maximized total harvestable N. Conversely, the higher rate of N maximized corn biomass and yields.

However, research on the interspecific interaction of nitrogen (N) between rice and aquatic legumes has rarely been undertaken. To address this issue, a pot experiment was conducted to investigate N utilization and the N interaction between rice and water mimosa (Neptunia oleracea Lour.) in an intercropping system. The root barrier patterns consisted of solid barrier (SB), mesh barrier (MB), and no barrier (NB) treatments. The N fertilizer application rates were low, medium, and high N rates. RESULTS The results showed that the NB treatment better facilitated rice growth compared with the MB and SB treatments. And the nitrate N content and urease activity of rice rhizospheric soil in the NB treatment were the highest of the three separated patterns. The ammonium N content in water mimosa rhizospheric soil and N-2 fixation of water mimosa ranked as NB > MB > SB. CONCLUSIONS The amount of N fixation by water mimosa was 4.38-13.64 mg/pot, and the N transfer from water mimosa to rice was 3.97-9.54 mg/pot. This can promote the growth of rice and reduce the application of N fertilizer. We suggest that the rice-water mimosa intercropping system is a sustainable ecological farming approach and can be applied in the field to facilitate rice production.

Alternate rows of cowpea did not reduce Striga density but planting the cowpea and sorghum in the same row, in the same or alternating hills, reduced Striga density and numbers of Striga per sorghum stand. Yields of sorghum grain in the same-row planting treatments were not significantly less than sole sorghum yields, and 200 to 700 kg ha- 1 of cowpea grain was produced. Alternating stands of sorghum and cowpea within the same row gave the best yield of sorghum and greater reduction of Striga. Production of mature Striga with capsules decreased with increasing cowpea ground cover, so that while cowpea may not reduce Striga emergence, it may hinder Striga development, possibly reducing the Striga seed bank over time.

Effect of plant density on forage yield and quality of intercropped corn and lablab bean	CROP SCIENCE			English	Article							"SILAGE; MAIZE"	Low crude protein (CP) concentration in corn (Zea mays L.) silage is its major dietary limitation in dairy rations. In this experiment, four densities of corn (20,000, 40,000, 60,000, and 80,000 plants ha(-1)) and four densities of lablab bean [Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet] (0, 40,000, 80,000, 120,000 plants ha(-1)) were intercropped to determine the optimal planting density in terms of forage yield, nutritive value, estimated milk production, and forage nutrient value. Experiments were conducted near Arlington and Lancaster, WI. Corn was sown in late April and lablab bean was sown in rows 8 cm beside corn rows 2 wk after corn planting. Averaged over locations, forage dry matter (DM) yield ranged from 11 Mg ha(-1) to 20 Mg ha(-1) as corn plant density increased from 20,000 to 80,000 plants ha(-1). Lablab bean increased CP concentration by 22 g kg(-1) DM between corn densities of 80,000 plants ha(-1) and 20,000 plants ha(-1) at a bean density of 120,000 plants ha(-1). Calculated milk ha(-1) values ranged from 17,500 kg ha(-1) to 34,400 kg ha(-1) as corn plant density increased from 20,000 to 80,000 plants ha(-1). This experiment does not show benefit to addition of lablab bean into high producing corn stands. Corn sown at a density of 80,000 plants ha(-1) and 0 bean plants ha(-1) is recommended to maximize forage DM yield, milk ha(-1), and crop value. Alternatively, addition of lablab bean into low density corn stands did increase CP concentration and feed nutrient value of the forage.

Millsp.) were collected from farmer's fields in its major cropping areas in Tanzania. Passport data, including descriptors, information on cultural practices and uses were recorded. Pigeonpea intercropping with maize, sorghum and cassava were found to be the dominating cropping systems, with characteristic differences between regions. In the northern part of the country pigeonpea has been developed into a relatively high yielding cash crop. Also in part of the Coastal Zone and Eastern Plain a market, particularly for green pods, have been developed. It is also in these areas near Dar es Salam that pigeonpea is most frequently found as a garden crop. The study showed that farmers mainly relay on self-saved seed, but seed is also quite often provided from other sources. About one third of the farmers selected sowing seed in the field at harvest. Seed storage was considered a great problem, and a variety of indigenous storage techniques were recorded. Chemical seed dressing was only common in the Northern Highlands, where the crop plays an important role as a cash crop. In all areas pigeonpea was consumed green as well as dry. Dry pigeonpea was most often consumed as whole grains, but dehulling was common especially in the Southern Plain. Most landraces identified were long-duration types, medium-duration types only being common in the Coastal Zone. The recorded plant and seed traits varied considerably, but the frequency of landraces with relatively large white or cream seeds and large pods was high in all regions. A number of accessions with potential resistance to fusarium wilt, bruchids and pod borer were identified.

INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS			English	Article						"Bioactive constituents; Humic acid; Intercropping; Lavender; Vermicompost"	"ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; WEED MANAGEMENT; LAVENDER; NITRATE; RETENTION; CULTIVARS; NITROGEN; MAIZE; YIELD"	In recent years, increased environmental concern about the application of synthetic fertilizers for agricultural purposes has resulted in a continuous search for sustainable and environmental-friendly alternatives. However, organic farming systems will not be sustainable without a proper understanding of plant responses and the optimization of these systems. The present study used a two-year factorial design to investigate the effects of the application of humic acid and vermicompost on the essential oil (EO) quantity and quality of Lavandula angustifolia L. intercropped with Brassica nigra L. Results showed that the application of both humic acid and vermicompost increased flower yield (2371.82 kg/ha) by 16.72%, EO content (3.18%) by 22.85%, and EO yield (59.09 kg/ha) by 42.69%. Although the fertilizers were found to be effective even at the lowest rates, the highest flower yield (2522.17 kg/ha), EO content (3.87%), and EO yield (97.61 kg/ha) were observed in the higher rates of humic acid (5000 mg/L) and vermicompost (7.5 t/ha). Forty individual chemical compounds, covering over 98.12% of the compounds, were analyzed by the GC-MS technique from the lavender grown under different treatments. The results demonstrated that the EO chemical profile was affected by the fertilizers and the highest linalool, limonene, and geraniol contents were recorded in the EO samples obtained from the application of 5000 mg/L humic acid and 7.5 t/ha vermicompost. Conversely, the maximum content of geranyl acetate, linalyl acetate, and beta-caryophyllene was isolated from the untreated plants. The six constituents listed above accounted for 87.1% of differentiation among treatments based a similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis. In conclusion, a combination of 5000 mg/L humic acid and 7.5 t/ha vermicompost can be recommended as a valid alternatives to reduce the demand for chemical fertilizers and their environmental hazards in lowly fertile areas.

J	"Ai, PR; Ma, YJ"				"Ai, Pengrui; Ma, Yingjie"			Estimation of Evapotranspiration of a Jujube/Cotton Intercropping System in an Arid Area Based on the Dual Crop Coefficient Method	AGRICULTURE-BASEL			English	Article						"intercropping; dual crop coefficient; water balance method; evapotranspiration"	"WATER-USE; IRRIGATED MAIZE; EVAPORATION; YIELD; SOIL; STRESS; MODEL; SURFACE; LAI"	An accurate estimation of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) in intercropping is critical for a theoretical basis for formulating an intercropping irrigation system of fruit trees and improving the soil moisture condition of orchards in arid regions of Southern Xinjiang. Herein, observational data such as soil moisture and plant physiological indicators were measured in jujube/cotton intercropping in the Aksu region from 2015 to 2017. The evapotranspiration of single-crop jujube and cotton was estimated using the modified dual crop coefficient method. Then, based on the proportion of intercropping crops, the soil water stress coefficient was introduced to estimate the evapotranspiration of the jujube/cotton intercropping. The results show that the model has good applicability to simulate single-crop jujube and cotton, and jujube/cotton intercropping. However, compared with single cropping, the accuracy of simulated daily evapotranspiration was decreased. In addition, adjusting the cotton irrigation amount caused the simulation accuracy to further decrease. From the perspective of interspecies complementarity and competition, cotton dominated the intercropping system and had better tolerance to external environmental changes than jujube trees. Intercropping had negative effects on jujube trees in general, and very obvious positive effects on cotton. Based on the 3-year crop yield, 5-year-old jujube trees are recommended for intercropping. During this time, the yield of cotton under the effect of interspecific complementation increased by 26.47%, and the yield of intercropping jujube was similar to that of single crop. As the jujube tree age increases, the effect of increasing cotton production gradually diminishes. The jujube trees also had a significant reduction in yield due to interspecific competition. Our research supports the dual crop coefficient method as appropriate to estimate crop ETc in intercropping and may be further used to improve irrigation scheduling for jujube/cotton intercropping.

The aim of the study was to determine the effect of cover crop biomass and the manner and time of mixing it with the soil on primary weed infestation of carrot compared with the conventional plough cultivation without the use of cover crops. The cover crop plants modified the state and reduced the degree of primary weed infestation of carrot compared to cultivation without cover crops. White mustard was the most effective in reducing primary weed infestation of carrot in all variants of tillage. Phacelia, buckwheat and oat cover crops also limited largely the number of weeds in carrot. The largest number of weeds was recorded in no-cover crop cultivation in no-tillage objects and those cultivated using subsoiler before winter, and cultivating in spring with aggregate. The largest reduction of primary weed infestation compared to conventional tillage was achieved in cultivation on ridges, with white mustard, phacelia or oats cover crops and weakest after vetch cover crop. In no-ploughing flat tillage system, lack of cover crop significantly increased the degree of weed infestation compared to conventional tillage, while the use of cover crops contributed to the reduction of primary weed infestation of carrot compared to cultivation without cover crops.

A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of water-soluble chitosan (WSC) on the growth and Cd uptake of the Cd-accumulator Hylotelephium spectabile and soybean (Glycine max) during a co-cultivation in Cd-contaminated agricultural soil (WSC, 0 and 10 g center dot m(-2)). The results indicated that soybean yields were highest in response to the intercropping and WSC treatment. The results from the field trials generally showed that intercropping and WSC treatments significantly decreased Cd concentrations in inedible parts of soybean by 42.9-72.1% (except for stems), in the meantime, increased 95.8%-334.6% in shoot and root tissues of H. spectabile compared with the control (p < 0.05). The data revealed that Cd uptake was highest for H. spectabile during the intercropping and WSC treatment. The application of WSC in the intercropping system significantly increased the uptake of Cd by H. spectabile, but not by soybean. The findings of this study suggest that combining an intercropping system with a WSC treatment may be better for remediating Cd-contaminated soils than other methods involving the growth of a single hyperaccumulator. NOVELTY STATEMENT This paper clearly focused on the accumulation and uptake of Cd in the system of intercropping of Cd-accumulator (Hylotelephium spectable) and soybean (Glycine max) grown in Cd-polluted farmland soils supplied with water-soluble chitosan (WSC) under field conditions. Some studies mainly focused on active agent to promote remediation efficiency of (hyper) accumulators. This study indicated that combining the intercropping system with WSC may be better for remediating Cd-contaminated soils than the methods involving a single hyperaccumulator.

It is a stress-resilient crop with high nutritional value, considered a promising source of traits to breed for adaptation/mitigation of climate change effects. It is also reported as a suitable crop for more sustainable production systems such as intercropping. In this review, we elaborate an integrative perspective including not only an agronomic-based but also a variety-breeding-based strategy in grass pea to deal with climate change impacts, summarizing the current knowledge on grass pea biotic /abiotic stress resistance. Additionally, we highlight the importance of implementing fundamental techniques to create diversity (as interspecific hybridization or gene editing) and increase genetic gains (as speed breeding or the efficient identification of breeding targets via genomics) in the development of multiple stress-resistant varieties that simultaneously provide yield and quality stability under climate vulnerable environments.

A 2-year field experiment was conducted at the agronomy research farm of the University of Agriculture Peshawar, Pakistan during 2015-2016 (Y1) to 2016-2017 (Y2) having semiarid climate. Four summer crops, pearl millet (Pennisetum typhoidum L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) and mungbean (Vigna radiata L.) and pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.) and four winter crops, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), fababean (Vicia faba) and rapeseed (Brassica napus) were grown under two irrigation regimes (full vs. limited irrigation) with the pattern of growing each crop either alone as sole crop or in combination of two crops in each intercropping system under both winter and summer seasons. The result showed that under full irrigated condition (no water stress), all crops had higher crop growth rate (CGR), leaf dry weight (LDW), stem dry weight (SDW), and spike/head dry weight (S/H/PDW) at both anthesis and physiological maturity (PM) than limited irrigated condition (water stress). In winter crops, both wheat and barley grown as sole crop or intercropped with fababean produced maximum CGR, LDW, SDW, S/H/PDW than other intercrops. Among summer crops, sorghum intercropped either with pigeon pea or with mungbean produced maximum CGR, LDW, SDW, and S/H/PDW at both growth stages. Sole mungbean and pigeon pea or pigeon pea and mungbean intercropping had higher CGR, LDW, SDW, S/H/PDW than millet and sorghum intercropping. On the other hand, wheat and barley grown as sole crops or intercropped with fababean produced maximum CGR, LDW, SDW, and S/H/PDW than other intercrops. Fababean grown as sole crop or intercropped with wheat produced higher CGR, LDW, SDW, and S/H/PDW at PM than intercropped with barley or rapeseed. From the results it was concluded that cereal plus legume intercropping particularly wheat/fababean in winter and sorghum/pigeon pea or sorgum/mungbean in summer are the most productive intercropping systems under both low and high moisture regimes.

The C cycle is one of the important biogeochemical processes in the agroecosystem and requires microorganisms to participate in many of the important C cycling pathways, such as C fixation, C degradation, and methane metabolism. Insight into the functions of microbial communities in the C cycle can provide a better understanding of the response and feedback of soil microbes with respect to global climate change. The microarray GeoChip 5.0 was used in this study to detect the specific genes linking C cycling and soil microbial-mediated processes and to evaluate the abundance, diversity and similarity of the detected genes responding to different nitrogen (N) application levels under intercropping treatment. Our results indicated that compositional changes in soil microbial communities elicited by N input have functional implications for C cycling and storage in agroecosystems. We further identified a sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) field as a C sink in this intercropping system, in which sugarcane/soybean (Glycine max) (1:2) strip intercropping (SB2) at the N1 application rate (SB2-N1) had the largest C sequestration potential and net C balance among all the treatments. Most of the functional genes involved in C cycling with regards to fixation and degradation were separately identified after 4 years of N fertilization and intercropping treatments, and environmental factors were central in shaping the functional gene structure related to the C cycles. Overall, our results suggested that reduced N application combined with intercropping treatment mediates ecosystem functions and may have profound feedback effects on global climate change.

Intercropping barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) with Egyptian clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) could increase the grain yield of barley and improve resource use efficiency of the intercropping system. However, non-optimum planting geometry has been a hurdle in the adaptation of barleybased cropping systems. This study was aimed at optimizing the planting geometry, and assess the productivity and profitability of barley-Egyptian clover intercropping system. Ten different planting geometries, differing in number of rows of barley, width and number of irrigation furrows and planting method were tested. Intercropping barley with Egyptian clover improved 56-68% grain yield of barley compared with mono-cropped barley. Barley remained dominant crop in terms of aggressiveness, relative crowding coefficient and competitive ratio. The amount of water used was linearly increased with increasing size of barley strip from 3 to 8 rows. The highest water use efficiency (4.83 kg/cf3) was recorded for 8-row barley strip system with 120 cm irrigation furrows compared to rest of the planting geometries. In conclusion, 8-rows of barley planted on beds with Egyptian clover in 120 cm irrigation furrows had the highest net income and cost benefit ratio. Therefore, it is recommended that this planting geometry can be used for better economic returns of barley-Egyptian clover intercropping system. However, barley strips with >8 rows were not included in this study, which is limitation of the current study. Therefore, future studies with >8 barley rows in strip should be conducted to infer the economic feasibility and profitability of wider barley strips.

In 2016, the sugar beet-soybean intercropping resulted in the highest Na and alpha-amino-N concentrations in the sugar beet (2.384 and 2.879 meq. 100 g(-1) beet respectively), but in 2017 the concentrations of these compounds were not significantly different between the intercropping patterns. For all intercropping patterns the land equivalent ratio (LER) was greater than one. In 2016, the highest LERT, based on white sugar yield, was obtained in the sugar beet-soybean intercropping system (1.27 for cv. Vaclav), but in 2017 the highest LERT based on white sugar yield, was obtained in sugar beet-Moldavian balm intercropping (1.24 for cv. Vaclav). Among the sugar beet cultivars, Ghazira had the highest sugar concentration and white sugar yield. It was concluded that the sugar beet-Moldavian balm intercropping system could be used in organic production systems to achieve high land productivity.

MILLSP.; SOIL-WATER; REDISTRIBUTED WATER; FUNGAL HYPHAE; GROWTH; TREES; COMPETITION; NUTRIENT; PLANTS"	Background and aimbHydraulically lifted water can be redistributed to a neighbouring plant, a process referred to as bioirrigation. Facilitation of bioirrigation by beneficial microbes such as arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi that form a common mycorrhizal network (CMN) between neighbouring plants has often been suggested but is not yet well explored. In this study, we tested if the presence of a CMN can facilitate the transfer of hydraulically lifted water from pigeon pea (PP) to finger millet (FM) and ameliorate thereby thewater relations of the shallow-rooted FM during drought. Methods In a compartmented microcosm set up, PP roots were grown up to the bottom layer of the pot to access the soil moisture. Whereas FM roots were restricted into a shallow compartment, separated through a 21 mu m nylon mesh, without access to the moist bottom layer. We applied deuterium labelled water to the bottom layer of the pot to test if PP can perform hydraulic lift (HL) and if hydraulically lifted water is transferred to FM via a CMN. During the drought period we also assessed the water relations of FM to determine if bioirrigation mediated through a CMN can support the water relations of FM. Results Application of deuterium-enriched water to the moist bottom layer of the microcosms demonstrated the capability of PP to hydraulically lift water to the drier topsoil through an insulation layer of coarse gravel. Only FM plants that were connected to PP via a CMN were able to utilize HL water. As a consequence, FM bioirrigated by PP in the presence of a CMN was able to maintain its water relations during drought conditions and showed higher rates of survival than FM plants in monoculture. Conclusions Connecting the rhizosphere of two intercropping partners with a CMN can improve the water relations of shallow-rooted crops by bioirrigation. This finding has great potential for reducing drought induced crop yield loss in arid and semi-arid tropics.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of intercropping sweetpotato with groundnut and soybean at various phosphorus (P) fertilisation levels on the productivity of sweetpotato. A field experiment was conducted at Umbeluzi Research Station in southern Mozambique during the 2013/14, 2014/15 and 2015/16 growing seasons. The experimental design was a split plot with seven crop combinations and three P levels (0, 20 and 40 kg P ha(-1)). Phosphorus at 20 and 40 kg ha(-1) produced best total storage yield, total biomass and commercial root yields, whereas P at 40 kg ha(-1) favoured highest vegetative growth. Sweetpotato-groundnut intercropping produced the best commercial root yield and total biomass. Phosphorus applied at 40 kg ha(-1), combined with sweetpotato and groundnut intercropping, produced the highest total and commercial storage root yield but these two parameters were not significantly different from sweetpotato-groundnut intercropping at 20 kg P ha(-1). For farmers growing sweetpotato under similar climatic and soil conditions, we recommend intercropping with ground-nuts and additional application of 20 kg P ha(-1) for farmers with fertiliser access.

The shade caused by intercropping changes plant growth traits, such as soybean leaf and dry mass, thereby reducing yields. To improve the yield and elucidate the genetic mechanism of the leaf-related traits in intercropped soybeans, we measured the F6: 7-8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross of 'Nandou 12' and 'Jiuyuehuang' for six leaf-related traits under monoculture and relay intercropping in 2015 and 2016. We found 6366 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) markers that covered the whole genome of soybean distributed in 20 linkage groups, which spanned 2818.67 cM with an average interval of 0.44 cM between adjacent markers. Nineteen quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected in two environments in 2 years. Three candidate genes associated to leaf-related traits were found according to gene expression and GO enrichment analyses. These results revealed the susceptibility of leaf phenotype to shading and helped elucidate the mechanisms that control leaf-related traits.

However, the response of the soil microbial community diversity and structure to intercropping is not well understood. Since microbial diversity corresponds to soil quality and plant health, a pot experiment was conducted with sugarcane intercropped with soybean. Rhizosphere soil was collected 40 days after sowing, and MiSeq sequencing was utilized to analyze the soil microbial community diversity and composition. Soil columns were used to assess the influence of intercropping on soil microbial activity (soil respiration and carbon-use efficiency: nitrogen-use efficiency ratio). PICRUSt and FUNGuild analysis were conducted to predict microbial functional profiling. Our results showed that intercropping decreased pH by approximately 8.9% and enhanced the soil organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, and available nitrogen (N) by 5.5%, 13.4%, and 10.0%, respectively. These changes in physicochemical properties corresponded to increased microbial diversity and shifts in soil microbial communities. Microbial community correlated significantly (p < 0.05) with soil respiration rates and nutrient use efficiency. Furthermore, intercropping influenced microbial functions, such as carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes, citrate cycle (TCA cycle) of bacteria and wood saprotrophs of fungi. These overrepresented functions might accelerate nutrient conversion and control phytopathogens in soil.

Intercropping IWG with a perennial legume such as alfalfa (Medicago sativa) could benefit nutrient cycling while increasing agroecological diversity. Intermediate wheatgrass was established at five environmentally diverse sites in Minnesota, USA in (1) bi-culture with alfalfa, (2) non-fertilized monoculture and (3) monoculture fertilized annually in the spring with 80 kg N/ha. At northern sites where alfalfa growth was favoured, IWG grain yields were reduced in year 2 by growing IWG in bi-culture with alfalfa, relative to the monoculture systems. Across all sites IWG grain yield decreased by 90% in the non-fertilized monoculture, 80% in the fertilized monoculture and 65% in the bi-culture from year 2 to 4 and plant macronutrient concentrations decreased by 25-70%. In year 4, IWG grain yield was similar or greater in the bi-culture than the fertilized monoculture at three of the five sites and alfalfa biomass was correlated positively with grain yield, harvest index and nutrient uptake in the year 4 bi-culture. Chemical-nitrogen fertilization increased grain yields in year 2 but did not mitigate the decline in yields as stands aged. Intermediate wheatgrass in the bi-culture had similar yields and nutrient uptake and lower yield declines than the chemically fertilized stand at sites where alfalfa growth was maintained throughout the life of the stand."

As its pests are mainly controlled with insecticides that are harmful to the environment and human health, alternative practices such as intercropping have been studied for their potential to promote biological control. Based on the published literature, this study aimed to review the effect of wheat-based intercropping systems on insect pests and their natural enemies. Fifty original research papers were obtained from a systematic search of the peer-reviewed literature. Results from a vote-counting analysis indicated that, in the majority of studies, pest abundance was significantly reduced in intercropping systems compared with pure stands. However, the occurrence of their natural enemies as well as predation and parasitism rates were not significantly increased. The country where the studies took place, the type of intercropping and the crop that was studied in the association had significant effects on these results. These findings show that intercropping is a viable practice to reduce insecticide use in wheat production systems. Nevertheless, other practices could be combined with intercropping to favour natural enemies and enhance pest control.

The results showed that the density of soil nematodes in jujube orchards became larger when wheat was planted between the lines of jujube trees, mainly due to the higher numbers of Rhabditis and Acrobeloides. The bacterivores of cp-1 and cp-2 (c-p, colonizer-persister) guilds, and fungivores of cp-2 guilds were much more in jujube/wheat intercropping system than those in jujube monoculture system, while other nematode groups had no significant difference between the two ecosystems. Although Shannon-Weaver index (H'), genus dominant index (Ig) and species richness (SR), showed no differences between the two systems, still lower maturity index (MI) and modified maturity index (Sigma(MI)) with higher PPI/MI presented enriched but unstable soil food web in jujube/wheat intercropping system. Higher nematode channel ratio (NCR) and Wasilewska index (WI) in the intercropping system indicated that bacterial decomposition channel was dominant channel with higher level of soil total nitrogen content in both layers but lower organic matters in surface layer. We concluded that jujube/wheat intercropping system is good for young tree growing, but jujube monoculture system is preferred if cultivated land is sufficient. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Effect of cropping system on cotton biomass accumulation and yield formation in double-cropped wheat-cotton	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION			English	Article						"Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.); Wheat and cotton intercropping; Wheat and cotton sequential cropping; Yield; Growth and development"	"MAX L MERRILL; IRRIGATED COTTON; GROWTH; COMPONENTS; PHENOLOGY; CULTIVAR; TROPICS; UPLAND; SEASON"	Wheat-cotton double cropping practices on a large scale in cotton belt of the Yellow River Valley and the Yangtze River Valley in China. Field experiments were conducted to determine the effects of wheat-cotton double cropping on cotton biomass accumulation and yield formation during 2011/12 and 2012/13 growing seasons. Two cotton cultivars, Siza 3 (mid-late maturity) and CCRI 50 (early maturity), were used in three cropping systems including monoculture cotton (MC), wheat/intercropped cotton (W/IC) and wheat/direct-seeded cotton (W/DC). Lint yield in double cropping systems were significantly lower than that in monoculture. Compared with MC for Siza 3, lint yield in W/IC and W/DC were decreased by 10.9 and 41.8%, respectively and 9.9 and 35.9% for CCRI 50, respectively. These reductions were largely ascribed to the fewer cotton bolls per unit area. Growth analysis showed that IC showed a pronounced delay in early development due to the initial shading from wheat on cotton seedlings and owing to delayed sowing, DC was easily affected by lower temperature during flowering and boll formation stage. And that consequently was delaying reproductive development, affecting cotton biomass accumulation and distribution and finally limiting crop productivity. Further, the diminished source capacity coupled with inadequate biomass production was the main determinant factor to limit lint yield in W/IC, while the reduced sink capacity with less partition to reproductive organs was the primary factor limiting lint yield in W/DC. Comparing to mid-late maturity of Siza 3, early maturity cultivar of CCRI 50 had a yield advantage in double cropping sequential system, since its shorter growing period.

Tolerance vs. avoidance: two strategies of soybean (Glycine max) seedlings in response to shade in intercropping	PHOTOSYNTHETICA			English	Article						"biomass partitioning; gas exchange; leaf structure; monocropping; palisade mesophyll; stem elongation"	"PHOTOSYNTHESIS; LIGHT; NITROGEN; SUN; COMPETITION; LEAVES; YIELD; WHEAT; PHYTOCHROMES; IRRADIANCE"	Intercropping is a sustainable agricultural practice used worldwide for highly efficient utilization of resources. However, short crops often grow under the shade of the canopy of tall crops in intercropping systems. Plants evolved two main strategies to deal with shade: avoidance and tolerance. Soybean (Glycine max), a legume crop, is often planted in intercropping. But little is known about a strategy that soybean may employ to deal with shade at seedling stage. Therefore, we determined morphological and physiological traits related to shade tolerance and shade avoidance in seedlings of two varieties. Generally, both varieties showed similar shade tolerance traits, such as increased specific leaf area and chlorophyll (Chl) content, and reduced photosynthetic capacity and the Chl a/b ratio. The light-limiting environment eliminated the benefits of shade tolerance traits for the carbon gain, which led to similar real-time photosynthesis and biomass in intercropping. By contrast, two varieties expressed different changes in shade avoidance traits. The variety Guixia 3 exhibited clear preference of shade avoidance that resulted in a high main stem, hypocotyl elongation, and biomass allocation towards the stem. The variety Gongxuan 1 showed those traits less. We suggested that the genetic variation occurs within soybean, thus the shade avoidance related traits might be important for variety selection for intercropping. Hence, the evaluation of performance should focus on shade avoidance in soybean genotypes in future experiments.	"[Gong, W. Z.; Wu, Y. S.; Chen, H. H.; Liu, W. Y.; Yang, W.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							"ESTIMATING N RHIZODEPOSITION; BELOW-GROUND NITROGEN; PLANT-SOIL SYSTEM; LOLIUM-PERENNE; FIELD PEA; N-15; RHIZOSPHERE; ROOT; FIXATION; TURNOVER"	Compounds released by mungbean roots potentially represent an enormous source of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) in mungbean-oat intercropping systems. In this study, an in situ experiment was conducted using a N-15- C-13 double stem-feeding method to measure N and C derived from the rhizodeposition (NdfR and CdfR) of mungbean and their transfer to oats in an intercropping system. Mungbean plants were sole cropped (S) or intercropped (I) with oat. The plants were labeled 5 weeks after planting and were harvested at the beginning of pod setting (I-p and S-p) and at maturity (I-m and S-m). More than 60% and 50% of the applied N-15 and C-13, respectively, were recovered in each treatment, with N-15 and C-13 being quite uniformly distributed in the different plant parts. NdfR represented 9.8% (S-p), 9.2% (I-p), 20.1% (S-m), and 21.2%(I-m) of total mungbean plant N, whereas CdfR represented 13.3% (S-p), 42.0%(I-p), 15.4% (S-m), and 22.6% (I-m) of total mungbean plant C. When considering the part of rhizodeposition transferred to associated oat, intercropping mungbean released more NdfR and CdfR than mungbean alone. About 53.4-83.2% of below-ground plant N (BGP-N) and 58.4-85.9% of BGP-C originated from NdfR and CdfR, respectively. The N in oats derived from mungbean increased from 7.6% at the pod setting stage to 9.7% at maturity, whereas the C in oats increased from 16.2% to 22.0%, respectively. Only a small percentage of rhizodeposition from mungbean was transferred to oats in the intercropping systems, with a large percentage remaining in the soil. This result indicates that mungbean rhizodeposition might contribute to higher N and C availability in the soil for subsequent crops.

Bieb.; triticale"	"LIVING MULCH SYSTEM; KURA CLOVER; BOTANICAL COMPOSITION; TRIFOLIUM-AMBIGUUM; DETERGENT FIBER; NUTRITIVE-VALUE; DRY-MATTER; YIELD; QUALITY; CORN"	Intercropping cereal crops with perennial legumes for forage has been demonstrated as a means to improve nutritive value compared to cereal crops alone. Our objective was to determine whether sowing winter rye (Secale cereale L.) or winter triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack) into living Caucasian clover (Trifolium ambiguum M. Bieb.) improves yield or nutritive value compared to monoculture cereal crop forage in northern Europe. The experiments were conducted near Mochelek and Falecin, Poland. In autumn 2010 and 2011, winter rye was sown into existing Caucasian clover or in monoculture at Mochelek, and winter triticale was sown into Caucasian clover or in monoculture at Falecin, with monoculture clover as a third crop treatment at both locations. The following spring, first harvest of forage from the three crop treatments was taken at two maturities: when monoculture cereals reached heading (BBCH 51) or grain milk stage (BBCH 71), and two additional harvests were taken from mixture plots and monoculture clover before autumn. First harvest forage yields of mixtures were similar to monoculture cereal at Falecin, less than monoculture cereal at Mochelek, and greater than monoculture clover at both locations. Full season forage yields of mixtures were greater than both monoculture cereal and clover crops at both locations. The proportion of clover in mixtures was 20-31% in the first harvest, resulting in slightly lower neutral detergent fiber concentrations than in monoculture cereal crop at Falecin, but no improvement in nutritive value at Mochelek. By spring 2012, most Caucasian clover had died from Sclerotinia trifoliorum infection at both locations, so forage was not harvested in the second year of the experiment. Although total season forage yields were greater for mixtures than for either monoculture cereal or Caucasian clover, this system cannot be recommended for northern Europe because of failure for Caucasian clover to persist.

In this study, the essential oil constituents of two weeds, wild oat (Avena fatua) and crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis), were investigated in relation to their effects on the growth and allelochemical production of wheat (Triticum aestivum). Subsequently, by means of gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, 52 compounds were identified from the crabgrass essential oil, particularly a signaling compound called methyl jasmonate, while 28 constituents were detected in the wild oat essential oil. Both essential oils were rich in terpenoids and inhibited the growth of wheat in air, filter paper and soil media but their inhibition varied with the growth medium and the weed species. In both the air and the filter paper media, there were not significant differences in the dry weight of wheat between the wild oat and the crabgrass essential oils. However, there was a greater reduction in the dry weight of the wheat root and plant with the wild oat essential oil than with the crabgrass essential oil in the soil medium. Furthermore, the production of the allelochemical, 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one, in wheat was induced by the essential oils. The results suggest that allelopathic interference with wheat by wild oat and crabgrass affects not only the biomass allocation, but also the allelochemical production, of wheat.

The treatments were, sole crop of autumn sugarcane planted at 67.5 cm spacing in October (T-1), sugarcane planting at 90 cm spacing in October and two rows of wheat intercrop in between (T-2); wheat sown in end October by FIRB system, (two rows of wheat on 37.5 cm wide bed) and sugarcane in furrows (30 cm wide) at monthly interval from October to March (T-3-T-8). In T-9 and T-10, the sugarcane was planted at 67.5 and 75 cm row spacing in April after harvesting of wheat. For T-3-T-8, irrigation was applied in furrows of FIRB wheat preferably in the evening and three budded sugarcane setts were planted next morning by pressing into the wet soil manually (wet planting). The results clearly revealed that the productivity of sugarcane varies with the planting method and time. The highest cane yield was obtained at all the locations when the sole sugarcane was planted in autumn at 67.5 cm spacing. In wheat based cropping systems, sugarcane planted in furrow of FIRB wheat during February-March gave significantly more yield than the crop planted in wheat furrows during November, December and January months at Ludhiana and during December and January at Faridkot and Ladhowal. The lowest cane productivity was recorded when planted after wheat harvesting. The wheat productivity on raised beds varied from 37.5 to 37.9 q/ha at Ludhiana, 46.0 to 47.8 q/ha at Faridkot and 32.1 to 34.9 q/ha at Ladhowal clearly pronouncing the effect of agro-ecological and adaphic factors.

Wheat and chickpea roots were grown in compartments separated either by a solid barrier to prevent any root interactions or by a nylon mesh (30 mu m) to permit partial root interactions, or with no separation between the compartments. Two P sources were applied at 60 mg P kg(-1) soil either as sodium phytate or ferrous phosphate (FePO4). The decline of soil pH after growing plants for 42 days was alleviated by supplying organic P or intercropping while receiving organic P. The ameliorating of soil acidification resulted mainly from a decrease in excess cations over anion uptake of both wheat and chickpea under phytate supply, compared to FePO4 supply. The excess cation uptake of chickpea was reduced by root interactions.

ACTA SCIENTIARUM POLONORUM-HORTORUM CULTUS			English	Article						"Scorzonera hispanica; weed infestation; intercrops; oat; phacelia; vetch; ploughing"	"COVER-CROP; TILLAGE"	"The quantity of weeds depends on biotopic factors, on the supply of seeds in the soil and agrotechincal procedures, which stimulate or inhibit weed germination and development. Intercrop plants applied in contemporary systems, modifying the soil environment, also influence the weed infestation of crops. The aim of conducted studies was to determine the effect of intercrop plant application and kind of ploughing upon the state and degree of Spanish salsify weed infestation. In the field experiment with growing Spanish salsify (Scorzonera hispanica L.) the following intercrop plants were applied: common vetch (Vicia saliva L.), tansy phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia Benth.), oat (Avena saliva L.), as well as differentiated soil tillage: conventional plough cultivation with pre-winter mouldboard ploughing without intercrop; intercrop plant sowing plus deep pre-winter ploughing; intercrop plant sowing plus spring ploughing. In Spanish salsify weed infestation jointly 37 taxons of weeds were determined, among which the most numerously occurred: Chenopodium album L., Senecio vulgaris L., Capsella bursapastoris (L.)

A 2-yr field study was conducted using a cultivar of berseem clover and two barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivars as sole crops compared to six berseem clover-barley intercrops planted at three seeding rates (250-338, 500-225, or 750-113 seeds m(-2)). The objective of the study was to compare forage and protein yield productivity for sole crops with crop mixtures. Land equivalent ratio (LER), relative crowding coefficient (RCC), aggressivity (A) which indicates the relative yield increase of legume in comparison with that of cereal in an intercropping system, and competition ratio (CR) were also assessed. Barley was cut once, while berseem clover was cut four times. Total dry matter (DM) yield produced by most intercrops was similar with that of berseem clover sole crop averaged 24.9 Mg ha(-1), but greater than that of barley sole crops averaged 12.7 Mg ha(-1). Berseem clover sole crop and its intercrop with barley at 750-113 seeds m(-2) provided the greatest total protein yield. Total LER or RCC did not exceed unity for the intercrop, which indicated that there was no advantage of the intercrops over sole cropping systems. The results of this study indicated that intcreropping of berseem clover with barley at the seeding rate of 750-113 seeds m(-2) could be used as alternative practice of berseem clover sole crop for high forage and protein production.

The yield of chickpea was adversely affected by intercropping with Indian mustard [Brassica juncea (L.) Czernj. & Cosson], barley (Hordeum vulgare L., s.l.) and linseed (Linum usitatissimum L.). However, the magnitude of reduction was relatively greater in Indian mustard. Further, the yield of chickpea increased as the proportion of chickpea increased in the mixture from 2:1 to 4:1, while reverse trend was noticed in the yield of intercrops. Sole Indian mustard recorded the highest total productivity in terms of chickpea-equivalent yield (CEY), followed by chickpea + Indian mustard (2:1), chickpea + linseed in various row proportions and sole chickpea recorded similar CEY, which was markedly lower than sole barley and linseed and chickpea intercropped with Indian mustard and barley in various proportions, except chickpea + barley in 4:1 row proportion. Among various intercropping systems, chickpea + barley, especially in 2:1 and 3:1 row proportions, showed yield advantages in terms of land-equivalent ratio (LER), while all the sole intercrops and chickpea-based intercropping systems, except chickpea + linseed (4:1) recorded higher income equivalent ratio over sole chickpea. All the intercrops were more competitive and aggressive than chickpea. Based on relative crowding coefficient, chickpea intercropped with barley in all row proportions and with linseed in 3:1 and 4:1 row proportions were the compatible intercropping systems.

Merr.] production has led to increased use of herbicides for weed control. Some producers are seeking alternative weed control methods, such as smother crops, that would reduce dependence on chemical weed control. A successful smother crop must compete strongly with weeds but minimally with the crop. In four environments, we intercropped three annual Medicago spp. (medics) with soybean to test their utility as a smother crop for weed control. Annual medics were intercropped with soybean at rates of 0, 85, 258, or 775 seeds m(-2) , and the intercrops were grown with and without weed control. Increasing medic seeding rate decreased weed yields but also reduced soybean herbage and grain yields. For the weed-controlled treatment, average soybean grain yields declined 7 kg ha(-1) for every 10 seeds m(-2) increase in medic seeding rate. Soybean grain yield was lower when grown with Medicago scutellata L. cv. Sava than when grown with Medicago polymorpha L. cv. Santiago or Medicago lupilina L. cv. George. Soybean grain yield was negatively related (r = -81) to medic herbage production. In the autumn following soybean harvest, medic residue ranged from 200 to 3700 kg ha(-1) depending on the location and seeding rate. Medics provided residue for soil protection, suppressed weeds, but also reduced soybean yields.

Our objective was to evaluate productivity and returns in a grain sorghum/soybean strip-intercropping system under irrigated and rainfed environments in eastern Nebraska. Crops were grown in alternating 20-ft. strips in a north-south orientation on a Sharpsburg silty clay loam (fine, montmorillonitic, mesic typic Argiudoll). A full-season grain sorghum hybrid was grown with soybean cultivars of different maturity groups. Combine-harvested yields of the two border rows of grain sorghum and soybean were compared with the middle four rows of each crop to determine border effects. Under irrigation, grain sorghum yields in the outside two rows increased in 4 of 5 yr, a maximum of 21 bu/acre in 1986 and 1989, and 5-yr average of 9 bu/acre. Under rainfed conditions, grain sorghum border row yields were less consistent, averaging 2.5 bu/acre higher. Soybean yield reduction in border rows was variable, averaging 5 bu/acre for rainfed and 3 bu/acre for irrigated conditions. Soybean cultivar and planting system had limited effect on either sorghum or soybean yields. This system may he a useful alternative cropping pattern to reduce long-term soil erosion, a valuable result for society.

Clover significantly reduced the dispersal of spores in a horizontal direction by 33% at a distance of 15 cm from a line inoculum source compared with a wheat monocrop. The clover also reduced the vertical movement of spores from infected leaves at the base of wheat plants by an average of 63 % compared to the monocrop, and this suggests that the main movement of spores was from the base upwards. Splash experiments using blue colour marker showed the vertical decline of splash and the number of drops per cm(2) with height caught on paper adjacent to trays of clover was described by the exponential decline model. The effect of clover in reducing vertical splash approached an asymptote as the leaf area index of the understorey increased. Simulated rain-splash increased the level of disease on the nag leaf and, in one experiment, there was a significant interaction between rain-splash and clover in reducing the number of lesions on the flag leaf. The level of disease resulting from one splash event was low, indicating that subsequent pathogen multiplication is probably required to bring about high severities of disease.

The mean index of moisture adequacy (MIma) during juvenile, vegetative and reproductive phases was 0.77, 0.85 and 0.78, respectively, in a moisture-sufficient season, and 0.64, 0.41 and 0.25 under moisture stress season. Row intercropping of pearl millet - clusterbean (1:1) and strip cropping (4:4) with 50% of the sole pearl millet population produced only 16.6 and 35.4% lower yield hi a moisture-sufficient season, and 35.3 and 37.4% lower yield in moisture stress season. Non-proportional yield reductions in pearl millet due to change in plant populations were attributed to border effects. A moderate population of 88,888 plants ha(-1) (equal proportion of pearl millet and clusterbean) was optimum for row intercropping (1:1) and strip cropping (4:4) in moisture-sufficient season, and low (40,000 plants ha(-1)) to moderate populations produced satisfactory yields in moisture stress season.

In 1991, grain was also harvested with a research combine to assess if intercrops could be harvested mechanically. Grain yield of wheat was unaffected by intercropping (P < 0.05). Intercropping reduced grain yield of lentil by 87 to 95% when yield estimates were based on samples harvested manually, and by 70 to 85% when samples were harvested mechanically. The increased height at which pods formed on intercropped compared with sole-cropped lentil plants and subsequent enhancement in mechanical harvestability of grain in intercrops partially explains this difference in yield estimates between harvesting methods. The land equivalent ratio was 1.15 for grain yield across intercrop treatments with mechanical harvest, and 1.03 for the intercrop treatments when grain was harvested manually. While harvestability of the short-statured lentil aas enhanced in this investigation by intercropping, the low lentil yield under intercropping suggests that wheat-lentil mixtures are probably not adapted to cool semiarid regions.

This study evaluates (i) the ability of fababean (Vicia faba L.) to meet its M requirements from biological Ni fixation: (ii) the amount of N transferred to intercropped oat (Avena sativa L.); and (iii) N fertilizer management to maximize dry matter production and N-2 fixation in a cold soil. A randomized complete block experimental design with four replications was used with two rows of fababean alternating with two rows of oat. Urea was applied in bands between fababean or oat rows at 90 kg N ha(-1) to get the following treatments: (i) oat with added N (+N), fababean +N, inoculated with Rhizobium leguminosarum by. viceae (+I); (ii) oat +N, fababean without added N, inoculated (-N,+I); (iii) oat -N, fababean -N,+I; (iv) oat -N, fababean +N,-I; and (v) oat -N, fahabean -N,+I. A second study compared uptake of N-15-depleted fertilizer by oat and fababean, where the fertilizer was broadcast over the plot or band-applied between row of oat and fababean planted in alternate rows. Less than 1% of the uninoculated fababean plants nodulated in either experiment; thus, they were a good check for estimating N-2 fixation using the difference method. Nitrogen fertilizer increased dry matter production of fababean in some years, but did not increase N uptake. There was little evidence of N transfer from fababean to oat. Oat depended on N fertilizer for maximum dry matter production 3 of the 4 yr. Maximum total dry matter production was achieved by fertilizing the oat and not the fababean in 3 of the 4 yr. The amount of N-2 fixed by fababean averaged 50 kg N ha(-1). Fababean plants obtained >50% of their N from broadcast urea, but <10% when urea was banded between oat and fababean rows. Configuring a commercial drill to band fertilizer between pairs of oat rows alternating with fababean is a practical way to maximize both N-2 fixation and total dry matter production."

Twenty-four plots (289 m2 each) were arranged in a randomized complete block design for a 3 by 2 factorial experiment. Factors were cropping systems (com monoculture, soybean monoculture, and strip intercropping of com and soybean) and tillage systems (no-tillage and conventional tillage). Natural enemies were sampled during 1988, 1989 and 1990 by sweep net, suction net (D-Vac), pitfall traps and quadrat samples. Analyses of variance indicated that of 15 taxa analyzed, most foliage-inhabiting natural enemies were significantly more abundant in intercropping than in monoculture plots, whereas soil-inhabiting natural enemies had higher numbers in no-tillage plots than conventional tillage plots. Therefore, the results support the theory of greater abundance of natural enemies in more complex agroecosystems. Better environmental conditions in diversified treatments was the possible reason for these results. Com in intercropping plots provided shade, reduced wind speed, alternate food, and possibly higher humidity and lower temperatures for soybean natural enemies. A similar effect was likely caused by the stubble and weeds in no-tillage plots.

Merr. was grown under several light conditions to determine the role of red and far-red radiation in plant adaptation to vegetation shade. Neutral density, 'neutral' density with elevated far-red radiation, and green shade treatments were used in a greenhouse, producing calculated phytochrome photostationary state (P(fr)/P(r)+P(fr)) values of 0.68, 0.63 and 0.51, respectively. Cool-white fluorescent lamps either alone or in conjunction with far-red fluorescent lamps were used in a growth chamber, providing P(fr)/P(r)+P(fr) of 0.79 and 0.61, respectively. Daily photosynthetically active radiation was about 25% of daylight and was approximately equal for both greenhouse (2.15 MJ m-2) and growth chamber (2.57 MJ m-2). Developmental stage 4 weeks after sowing was similar for all treatments, but axillary growth and rates of leaf area and dry matter accretion differed between plants from greenhouse and growth chamber. Light conditions simulating vegetation shade (i.e. a low ratio of red to far-red radiation) significantly promoted petiole elongation and retarded the rate of stem elongation in both greenhouse and growth chamber experiments. Other aspects of growth either were not significantly altered by spectral quality or were not modified consistently in both greenhouse and growth chamber environments. Net photosynthetic rates measured under growth conditions for unifoliate and first trifoliolate (TF1) leaves of growth chamber plants between 9 and 21 d after sowing were generally unaffected by spectral quality, but supplemental FR enhanced TF1 leaf area expansion. The latter effect was not correlated with increased dry matter accumulation. The significance of spectral quality for adaptation of soybeans to canopy closure and intercropping is discussed.

In this study, the effect of nitrogen (N) fertilizer application rates on soil ecoenzymatic stoichiometry, microbial nutrient status and interspecific competition during the cogrowth stages in broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum L.)/mung bean (Vigna radiata L.) intercropping were investigated. Two-year field experiments (2018 and 2019) involved the use of the following N treatments: N0, 0 kg N ha- 1 (control); N1, 45 and 60 kg N ha- 1; N2, 90 and 120 kg N ha- 1; and N3, 135 and 180 kg N ha- 1 for mung bean and broomcorn millet, respectively. Intercropped broomcorn millet was the dominant species determined by positive competitive ratios and aggressivity values at the early (1.70 and 1.81), middle (2.06 and 1.98), and the later cogrowth stages (3.02 and 2.48), respectively. Nitrogen application increased the competitive ratio and aggressivity by 29.4 % and 24.5 %, respectively, compared with the control. Leaf photosynthesis and aboveground biomass of the two crops were altered by the N treatment, with high N fertilizer inputs significantly reducing the intercropping advantages and land use efficiency. Intercropping and N fertilizer improved interspecific competition and boosted grain yield in 2018 and 2019, and values were 6331.8 kg ha- 1 and 6531.3 kg ha- 1 for broomcorn millet and 905.0 kg ha- 1 and 979.8 kg ha- 1 for mung bean, respectively. Moreover, intercropping and N fertilization markedly affected the soil nutrient content, microbial biomass, and enzyme activity involved in carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) acquisition in both species. The soil ecoenzymatic C:N:P acquisition ratios were strongly associated with nutrient acquisition by microbes in the rhizosphere, highlighting the importance of microbial metabolic changes driven by nutrient stoichiometry to meet the soil nutrient demands. This study provides an explanation for considering more sustainable agricultural practices of cereal/legume intercropping based on reduced fertilizer application compared with monocropping."

R. Br.], (ii) sorghum sudangrass [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench x S. sudanense (Piper) Stapf], (iii) cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp], and (iv) sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.). Crops were seeded in monoculture and in three-and four-species mixtures using a replacement design where monoculture seeding rates were divided by the number of species in the intercrop. Crop biomass was sampled at similar to 45 and 90 d after planting. When averaged across the nine site-years, biomass at the first and second sampling dates, respectively, of the monoculture treatments ranged from 1040 and 2500 kg ha(-1) (cowpea) to 3000 and 9300 kg ha(-1) (pearl millet). In general, biomass production of the legume monocultures was lower than the grass monocultures and intercrops at both sampling dates. All intercrops had land equivalent ratios (LERs) greater than one, indicating complementarity, likely a result of resource partitioning. Intercrops, particularly the four-species mixture, exhibited greater stability in yields across environments. The pearl millet-sorghum sudangrass-sunn hemp intercrop had the greatest evenness, suggesting that species selected for annual intercrops should have similar monoculture growth rates to minimize asymmetric competition.

A factorial experiment was performed based on a randomized complete block design in 3 replications in 2018. The experimental factors consisted of cropping ratio at five levels: 1. sesame sole cropping, 2. mung bean sole cropping, 3. 75% sesame +25% mung bean (3:1), 4. 50% sesame +50% mung bean (1:1), 5. 25% sesame +75% mung bean (1:3). Sulfur fertilizer was used at three levels: control level (S-0), 50% of recommended amount (S-1), 100% of recommended amount (S-2). Thiobacillus bacteria was used at two levels: T-0 and T-1. The results showed that growth indices chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll, biological yield, and grain yield of sesame and mung bean were significantly affected by the studied treatments. The highest growth indices, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll, biological yield and grain yield of sesame were obtained by the 3:1 ratio. For the mung bean, the highest growth indices, chlorophyll a, biological yield, grain yield were obtained by mung bean sole cropping and the highest chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll were obtained by the 1:1 ratio. Also, sulfur fertilizer, 100% of the recommended amount, increased all studied indices in both plants except for chlorophyll a in sesame. Interaction effects of cropping ratio and location on growth indices, grain biological yield, chlorophyll a of sesame and mung bean were significant.

Introducing hyperaccumulators into crop planting systems results in the alleviation of the adverse effects of As and competition effect for resources. The balance between these two effects determines intercropping efficiency. The effect of using different hyperaccumulator populations on such balance is the focus of this study. Through a tank experiment, four P. vittata populations were compared on the basis of their intercropping efficiencies and physiological and morphological characteristics. The evaluation of the intercropping efficiency of P. vittata was mainly based on the capabilities of the species to promote growth and decrease As concentrations in intercropped Morus alba. Two populations of P. vittata were appropriate for intercropping with M. alba, with the alleviation effect of As harm as the main effect on the intercropping system. These populations showed extensive root overlap with M. alba and efficient uptake of bioavailable As, thus depleting As in the rhizosphere and lowering As risk. After different P. vittata populations were used, varied interspecific interactions were observed. Root overlap and aboveground morphological parameters are the key factors determining intercropping efficiency among P. vittata populations.

The experiment was carried out in a pot in the plastic house from June to September 2017. The experiment was designed using Completely Randomized Design with two treatment factors arranged factorially, i.e. AMF inoculation (M0= without, or M1= with AMF inoculation) and mungbean varieties (V) grown together with red rice plant (V1= Kenari, V2= Vima-1, V3= Vima-3, V4= Merak, and V5= No. 129). Each treatment combination was made in triplicate. The results indicated that inoculation had a significant effect in increasing filled panicle number, number of filled grains, and dry grain yield per pot, while decreasing percentage number of unfilled grains. For the rice plants incoluated with AMF, intercropping with mungbean of Kenari and Merak varieties produced similar or higher number of filled panicles compared to those without intercropping.

LER (Land Equivalent Ratio) and economic net income of different cropping systems based on cabbage as an index of intercropping efficiency were also evaluated. In the study, cabbage was used as a main crop, and cos lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. longifoila), leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. crispa), radish (Raphanus sativus L.), onion (Allium cepa L.) and snap bean (Phaseolus vulgarism L. var. nanus) were used as intercrops. Each of the intercrops was planted in between cabbage rows in separate plots. Cabbage and all intercrops were also grown as sole crops. There was no significant effect of different intercropping systems on growth characteristics and yield of cabbage compared with sole cabbage cropping except for radish as an intercrop, which affected adversely the yield and some growth characteristics of cabbage. Net income was increased significantly when cabbage was intercropped with cos lettuce, bean, leaf lettuce or onion. The values of LER appeared to be greater than 1 under intercropping systems. Cropping systems did not significantly affect nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium and iron content of cabbage. The results obtained in this Study pointed Out that intercropping systems based on cabbage might increase total yield, productivity and profitability.

In this study, we investigated the effects of tomato monoculture and tomato/potato-onion intercropping systems on tomato seedling growth and changes of soil microbial communities in greenhouse conditions. Results showed that the intercropping with potato-onion increased tomato seedling biomass. Compared with monoculture system, the alpha diversity of soil bacterial and fungal communities, beta diversity and abundance of bacterial community were increased in the intercropping system. Nevertheless, the beta-diversity and abundance of fungal community had no difference between the intercropping and monoculture systems. The relative abundances of some taxa (i.e., Acidobacteria-Subgroup-6,Arthrobacter,Bacillus,Pseudomonas) and several OTUs with the potential to promote plant growth were increased, while the relative abundances of some potential plant pathogens (i.e.,Cladosporium) were decreased in the intercropping system. Redundancy analysis indicated that bacterial community structure was significantly influenced by soil organic carbon and pH, the fungal community structure was related to changes in soil organic carbon and available phosphorus. Overall, our results suggested that the tomato/potato-onion intercropping system altered soil microbial communities and improved the soil environment, which may be the main factor in promoting tomato growth.

In this study, three cadmium (Cd)-accumulator species (Stellaria media, Malachium aquaticum, and Galium aparine) were intercropped together in Cd-contaminated soil to study the effects of intercropping on co-remediation. Mutual intercropping significantly increased the biomasses of S. media, M. aquaticum, and G. aparine compared with their respective monocultures. The photosynthetic pigment contents of three species were not significantly affected by mutual intercropping. Mutual intercropping did not increase the Cd contents in roots and shoots of G. aparine, but it increased the Cd contents in roots of S. media and M. aquaticum. It also decreased the Cd contents in shoots of S. media and M. aquaticum. Only G. aparine intercropped with M. aquaticum and three-species intercropping increased Cd-accumulation levels in whole plants of each species. Only S. media intercropped with M. aquaticum and three-species intercropping increased the Cd accumulation at the whole plant level in every plant in a single pot, with S. media intercropped with M. aquaticum showing the greatest increase. Therefore, S. media intercropped with M. aquaticum and three-species intercropping may improve the efficiency of phytoremediation of Cd-contaminated soil, with S. media intercropped with M. aquaticum representing the best combination.

The intercropping system is a beneficial method, which is widely used in tropical areas for sustainable soil fertility management, and has been found to improve both the yields of traditional agriculture and the income of small producers. Objectives. The aim of this study was to compare and evaluate the effect of associated culture and pure culture of cucurbit Lagenaria siceraria creeping plant and the variety of cassava Manihot esculenta var. 'Bonoua Blanc' upright plant on the agronomic performance of each crop. Method. An experiment was established in randomized complete block design with three replicates per treatment. The treatments compared were firstly, associated crops M. esculenta var. 'Bonoua Blanc' / L. siceraria with cucurbit seedlings at 0 days (CAT(0)), 15 days (CAT(15)), 30 days (CAT(30)) and 45 days (CAT(45)) after cassava; secondly, pure cultures of cucurbit on the same dates as for associated crops (CPT0, CPT15, CPT30 and CPT45), and thirdly, a pure culture of cassava at 0 days (CP). Nine agronomic characteristics were analyzed in cucurbit and eight in cassava. Results. The agronomic parameters evaluated were the yield components of cassava, which varied with the increase in seedling time of cucurbit. However, the performance of cucurbit decreased with the increase in seedlings either in the associated crop or in pure culture. Performance also decreased sharply for the same sowing dates in pure culture. Despite high productivity when cucurbit was simultaneously planted with cassava, it remained low compared to the cucurbit pure crop. Conclusions. Intercropping of cucurbit L. siceraria and cassava M. esculenta was not found to be beneficial to the yield of the individual crops. However, the use of cucurbit as an intercropping cover crop helps to conserve soil moisture and to manage arable land and weeds for the benefit of cassava crops."	"[Bi, Irie R.

On-station and on-farm studies were conducted in western Kenya to assess the potential role of greenleaf desmodium, Desmodium intortum (Mill.) Urb., in a combined control strategy for witchweed, St?iga hermonthica, and cereal stemborers in sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.). Treatments consisted of sorghum plots intercropped with D. intortum (intercrop), with sorghum monocrop plots (monocrop) serving as control. There were highly significant reductions in both S. hermonthica emergence (by up to 89% in the on-farm and 100% in the on-station trials) and the proportion of stemborer-damaged plants (by up to 85% in the on-farm and 67% in the on-station trials) in the intercrop compared to the monocrop in both trials during most of the study period. The sorghum plants were also significantly taller in the intercrop (by up to 88% in the on-farm and 58% in the on-station trials) than in the monocrop plots. Moreover, grain yields were significantly higher in the former (by up to 63% in the on-farm and 140% in the on-station trials) in both trials throughout the study period. These results demonstrate that intercropping sorghum with D. intortum offers an effective control of both pests, leading to higher grain yields.

The goal of the present study was to evaluate the initial responses of morphostructural characteristics of two different Urochloa brizantha cultivars grown in monocropping or intercropping systems over two agricultural years. U. brizantha cultivars Marandu and Piata were grown as monocrops or intercropped with corn or sorghum. A randomized block experimental design with a triple factorial scheme, two additional treatments (2x2x2+2) and four replicates was used. The following factors were tested: two U. brizantha cultivars (Marandu or Piata), two intercropping combinations (with corn or sorghum), and two agricultural years (2010/2011 and 2011/2012). An additional treatment included U. brizantha cultivars grown as monocrops. The morphogenic and structural characteristics and forage gross production rates were evaluated in the different cropping systems. Intercropping with grain crops had a negative effect on the initial productivity of U. brizantha, and areas with intercropping presented higher tiller density, lower rates of leaf emergence and elongation and lower forage gross production rates relative to the monocropping systems. However, intercropping is a viable alternative to conventional monocropping systems, which was indicated by the land equivalent ratio.

Although biodiversity utilization in paddy fields has increased in recent years, Si nutrition of rice in intercropping systems is poorly understood. The present research focused on deciphering the underlying mechanisms involved in rice and water spinach intercropping, which enhance Si uptake by rice. Methods We carried out a series of experiments including field, greenhouse, and incubation experiments to explore the plant-plant-soil interaction mechanisms. Results The field trials showed that rice and water spinach intercropping with different row ratios can increase Si concentration by 9.8 %-52.6 % and Si absorption by 34.7 %-127.8 % in rice leaves at ripening stage compared to rice monoculture. The pot trials further indicated that intercropping can promote rice to increase Si concentration in Si-deficient soil, with a significant increase of 35.9 % in stems and 29.7 % in leaves, and intercropping significantly increased soil CaCl2-Si content by 168.1 % compared to rice monoculture. In-depth research indicated that there was an interspecific rhizosphere interaction under intercropping conditions, which not only induced the up-regulated expression of Si transporter genes in rice roots (OsLsi1, OsLsi2) and stems (OsLsi6), but also stimulated rice roots to secrete more organic acids to increase Si availability in the soil. Moreover, water spinach root exudates helped reduce the polymerization or adsorption of monosilicic acid through proton efflux of roots. Conclusions Rice and water spinach intercropping can greatly enhance Si absorption of rice through several beneficial ways, which will have important practical significance for sustainable rice production, especially in Si-deficient soils.

Use of cultivar mixtures is one option, allowing the spread of plant epidemics to be slowed down. As dispersal of fungal foliar pathogens over short distances by rain-splash droplets is a major contibutor to the spread of disease, this study focused on modelling the physical mechanisms involved in dispersal of a non-specialized pathogen within heterogeneous canopies of cultivar mixtures, with the aim of optimizing host diversification at the intra-field level. Methods Virtual 3-D wheat-like plants (Triticum aestivum) were used to consider interactions between plant architecture and disease progression in heterogeneous canopies. A combined mechanistic and stochastic model, taking into account splash droplet dispersal and host quantitative resistance within a 3-D heterogeneous canopy, was developed. It consists of four sub-models that describe the spatial patterns of two cultivars within a complex canopy, the pathway of rain-splash droplets within this canopy, the proportion of leaf surface area impacted by dispersal via the droplets and the progression of disease severity after each dispersal event. Key Results Different spatial organization, proportions and resistance levels of the cultivars of two-component mixtures were investigated. For the eight spatial patterns tested, the protective effect against disease was found to vary by almost 2-fold, with the greatest effect being obtained with the smallest genotype unit area, i.e. the ground area occupied by an independent unit of the host population that is genetically homogeneous. Increasing both the difference between resistance levels and the proportion of the most resistant cultivar often resulted in a greater protective effect; however, this was not observed for situations in which the most resistant of the two cultivars in the mixture had a relatively low level of resistance. Conclusions The results show agreement with previous data obtained using experimental approaches. They demonstrate that in order to maximize the potential mixture efficiency against a splash-dispersed pathogen, optimal susceptible/resistant cultivar proportions (ranging from1/9 to 5/5) have to be established based on host resistance levels. The results also show that taking into account dispersal processes in explicit 3-D plant canopies can be a key tool for investigating disease progression in heterogeneous canopies such as cultivar mixtures."

However, less is known about the interactive effects of soil water, nitrogen and phosphorus on native species growth and relative competitive ability. A replacement series design method was used with 12 mixed plants of Bothriochloa ischaemum and Lespedeza davurica grown in a pot experiment under three water regimes and four fertility treatments. Intercropping systems were assessed on the basis of indices such as biomass production and allocation, relative competitive ability, aggressivity, relative yield total and water use efficiency (WUE). Water stress decreased significantly the total biomass production for each species, either in monoculture or in mixtures. N, P, or NP application can significantly improve biomass production of the two species in their mixtures. There was no obvious change trend in root/shoot ratio of B. ischaemum or L. davurica in different mixture proportions. Relative yield total (RYT) values ranged from 0.98 to 1.39. Aggressivity values of B. ischaemum to L. davurica were positive in all water regimes and fertilizations, implying that B. ischaemum was the dominant species. Relative competition intensity values of B. ischaemum (i.e., RCIB) were less than zero, while greater than zero for L. davurica (i.e., RCIL), indicating that the effects of intraspecific competition with L. davurica were stronger for B. ischaemum, and the opposite for L. davurica. WUE increased gradually as the proportion of B. ischaemum increased in mixtures, and a 10:2 B. ischaemum:L. davurica mixture proportion had significantly higher WUE. Results suggest that it is advantageous to grow the two species together to maximize biomass production and the recommended mixture ratio was 10:2 of B. ischaemum to L. davurica because it gave higher RYT and significantly higher WUE under conditions of water deficit.

In this study, soil quality index (SQI) has been computed on 190 sites of farmers' fields in southern India to evaluate the possible effect of land management practices on soil degradation and determine the critical levels of soil organic C stock to maintain a desirable SQI and also suggest appropriate management practices. In all, 26 predominant physical, chemical and biological properties of soils were studied and based on principal component analysis, moisture retention at field capacity, available soil N, available P, DTPA-extractable Zn, exchangeable sodium percentage, C-mineralization and bulk density were identified as the key indicators of the study region. SQI was also computed using four soil functions, viz. nutrient cycling, availability of water, resistance of soil to degradation, and salinity and sodicity. Soil resilience index was computed using data on substrate-induced respiration after exposing the soil to heat stress. SQI was highest under paddy followed by permanent fallow, maize, cotton, intercropping, redgram, and was lowest under castor system. Based on the results, it was observed that the soils which had higher SQI were also productive and they exhibited higher resilience capacity. An amount of 8.6 Mg ha(-1) soil organic C stock per 15 cm depth was found essential to maintain soil quality and 2.2 Mg ha(-1) of organic matter was needed every year to maintain this stock. On-farm participatory research trial was conducted using SQI as a tool for sustainable land-management practices.

The modifications included changes in chemical properties of the soil due to liming as manual option, changes in the estimation of soil Al saturation, effects of Na on the soil physical properties, interaction between climatic and nutrient constraints to crop growth, modifications in the estimation of labile P factor for uptake and in the calculations of the N and P stress factors which are now estimated as a function of the ratio between the daily uptake and daily demand for the potential growth. Moreover, the structure of a simple soil and plant K model designed to be incorporated into EPIC is described. The model maintains pools of exchangeable, soluble and fixed K for the mineral form in the soil; of crop residue K for the organic form and of grain, stover and root K for the crop form. The model runs on a daily time step, simulating K uptake by the crops and transformations between the different soil pools as well as several other processes like leaching, runoff, lateral subsurface flow, movement upward through soil evaporation, K recycling from crop residues and the effect of limited soil K availability on crop development. The model is sensitive to soil chemical and physical properties, crop K requirements, crop competition, tillage practices, fertilizer rate, and soil water content. In a second paper of this series, the test of the proposed modifications, including the plant and soil potassium sub-model, for simulations of crop growth, yield and nutrient uptake of a maize x cowpea intercrop in the semiarid NE of Brazil is presented.

ACTA SCIENTIARUM POLONORUM-HORTORUM CULTUS			English	Article						"tillage; ridges; chicory; inulin; protein"	"INTERCROP PLANTS; L.; INULIN"	"The method of tillage is one of the major factors determining the yield of root plants. Today we witness the degradation of soil on large cultivated lands. It is a result i.a. of more frequent tillage practices, and the omission of cover crops. The destruction of aggregate structures of the soil and the lowering of its organic matter content cause that conditions for growth and yields of the main crops are becoming worse. Field experiments were conducted in the years 2006-2008 on grey-brown podzolic soil with impermanent structure. The test plant was the rooted chicory (Cichorium intybus var. sativum Bisch.) of the 'Polanowicka' cultivar. This species has an important economical meaning, providing precious raw materials for inulin production. The experiments included: two kinds of pre-sowing tillage: a) a complex of pre-sowing tillage and sowing of cover crops (2nd decade of August) and pre-winter ploughing and mixing the green mass with soil, b) a complex of pre-sowing tillage and sowing of cover crops (2nd decade of August), leave them in the field during the winter and ploughing the plant mass in spring; two types of plant growing: in ridges or in flat soil; three cover crops: common vetch, tansy phacelia and oats. Beneficial influence of mulching the soil with tansy phacelia on the total chicory root, yield, compared with unmulched plots was observed. The highest content of inulin was found in chicory roots collected from plots mulched with common vetch. It was significantly higher than its content in roots coming from the plots mulched with oats. When the productivity of inulin per unit of area is taken into account, the most beneficial tillage combination was the tillage of chicory in ridges, after spring ploughing, mixing the mulch of common vetch with the soil. Both the cultivation of the plant in ridges and ploughed vetch affected the yield significantly. The factors of the experiment had no significant influence on the content of dry matter and protein in the roots of chicory."

However, the mechanisms stimulating this effect have not been revealed. The current study was designed to evaluate the changes in the subcellular distribution and chemical forms of Cd in different leaf types of F. arundinacea intercropped with C. arietinum L under different schemes. The results indicated that more than half of the Cd was bound in the cell wall in plant organs under all planting schemes, showing that cell wall deposition is an important detoxication pathway for the metal. Relative to the monoculture scheme, coordinate and malposed intercropping schemes increased the Cd concentration deposited in the cytoplasm of below-ground tissues from 37.6% to 45.2% and 45.1%, respectively. Additionally, the proportion of inorganic and water-soluble Cd in the below-ground parts of F. arundinacea increased from 73.6% in the monoculture scheme to 80.6% and 84.7%, in the coordinate and malposed intercropping schemes, respectively. The results exhibited that intercropping schemes can activate the metal in below-ground tissues and move it to aerial parts. The present study revealed the promoting mechanism of intercropping schemes on the phytoremediation efficiency of F. arundinacea for Cd at a subcellular level. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Effect of environment on multi-element grain composition of pigeonpea cultivars under farmers' conditions	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						"Cajanus cajan; cultivar variations; nutrient deficiencies; nutritional values; element interactions; intercropping; pigeonpea"	"PLASMA-MASS SPECTROMETRY; DANISH AGRICULTURAL CROPS; PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS L; ZINC-DEFICIENCY; TRACE-ELEMENTS; PHOSPHORUS; IRON; MANGANESE; GENOTYPES; SYSTEMS"	Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L. Millsp.) is often intercropped with maize (Zea mays L.) in eastern and southern Africa. The studies aimed at determining how different genotypes of pigeonpea responded in terms of grain element composition under farmers' cropping conditions. Approx. 78 farmers participated. They came from four study sites in Tanzania (Babati and Gairo) and Malawi (Nyambi and Ntonda) that differed in terms of tradition for using pigeonpea as well as in environmental conditions. The individual grain weight of the pigeonpea crops from Malawi were 21% (P < 0.05) higher than those from Tanzania. However, only B, Cu, Mo, N, Ni, P and S were affected by grain weight (P < 0.05). Weak (r(2) < 0.10) negative correlations existed between grain yield and the grains' proportion of Ca, Mg, P, and Zn. The proportion of every element, with the exception of Cr, in the grain differed between sites (P < 0.05) but not between varieties (P > 0.05). The amounts of K, Mg, S and Fe accumulated per grain were slightly lower (P < 0.11) in ICEAP00040 compared to the more traditional varieties. Variations in DTPA-exchangeable Zn and Fe in the soil were not reflected in grain concentrations but grain P had a curvi-linear relation (r(2) = 0.44) to the soil NaHCO3--exchangeable P indicating P deficiency for several soils. The P and Zn content were correlated (r(2) > 0.41) as the only two grain elements. Unique fingerprinting by multivariate statistics was possible for each site when using the element proportion of the grain dry matter with or without soil characteristics. In all cases, different elements contributed with varying weight to the discrimination between the sites. However, it was not possible to distinguish between the varieties when considering all four environments. Reducing the models to include Fe, K, Mg, P, S and Zn only, did however allow some distinction between the two genotypes, which indicates that genotypic variability is expressed in a fairly limited number of elements. In the cases of Gairo and Nyambi, it was possible to distinguish between varieties. In the case of Gairo, the models distinguished between ICEAP00068 and the others, i.e. ICEAP00040 and Babati White where ICEAP00068 was associated with a higher proportion of Fe, P, S, and Zn in the grain. In the case of Nyambi, the models distinguished between ICEAP00040 and ICP9145 where ICEAP00040 was associated with a lower proportion of Ca, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, P, S, and Zn and a higher proportion of Cr and Na in the grain. It is thus possible in some cases to separate varieties based on multi-element grain content across a relatively narrow environmental gradient but not generally across all environments. These findings should be included in breeding programmes focusing on the improvement of the nutritional value of our food crops.

While it is well known that inter-species nutrition competition in intercropping systems leads to high production efficiency, the effects of different spatial arrangements of intercropping species on these mechanisms remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to reveal differences in the soil nitrogen dynamics in the tomato-corn intercropping system with different spatial arrangements of crops and to determine suitable spatial arrangements. METHODS: A two-year experiment was carried out during the 2018 and 2019 seasons to determine inter-species nitrogen competition in the tomato and corn systems with different spatial arrangements. The treatments included sole corn (SC), sole tomatoes (ST), two rows of tomatoes intercropping two rows of corn (IC2-2), and four rows of tomatoes intercropping two rows of corn (IC4-2) systems. Additionally, the modified HYDRUS (2D/ 3D) model was used to quantify soil nitrogen concentrations, solute fluxes, soil nitrogen distribution, and soil nitrogen balance in the crop root zone under the SC, ST, IC2-2, and IC4-2 systems. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The modified HYDRUS (2D/3D) model could precisely capture the soil nitrogen dynamics with nRMSE ranging from 2.8% to 12.4%. In general, soil NH4-N concentrations in the root zone of tomatoes of different systems decreased as follows: IC2-2 > IC4-2 > ST, while a reverse trend was observed in the root zone of corn. Compared with soil NH4-N, differences in soil NO3-N among different systems were more evident due to its higher mobility. IC2-2 had the highest nitrogen flux, cumulative N flux, N uptake (CNU), and the land equivalent ratio for nitrogen (LERN) among different systems. Among different intercropping systems, the corn's and tomato's highest crop yields occurred in IC2-2 and IC4-2, respectively, with an average of 13,406.0 and 98,732.3 kg ha(-1) in both years. Additionally, corn and tomato's highest nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) occurred in IC2-2 and ST, respectively. However, the land-equivalent ratio for nitrogen use efficiency (LERNUE) in IC4-2 was 5.4% higher than in IC2-2. Therefore, IC4-2 is the optimal intercropping system recommended for sustainable agriculture development. SIGNIFICANCE: The findings of this study improve the understanding of the mechanisms of inter-species nitrogen competition between commercial and grain crops. The study also suggests to the farmers and government suitable spatial arrangements of an intercropping system that can be adopted to promote the development of sustainable agriculture.

For this purpose, three farmers preferred landraces of cassava (yace, blebou and six mois) and three morphotypes of gourd (dark green and round fruit, light green and round fruit, light green and long fruit) were used to test the three intercropping ratios (gourd: cassava with 6:42, 6:24 and 6: 18). Intercropping systems were assessed by land equivalent ratio (LER), area time equivalent ratio (ATER), relative crowding coefficient (K), actual yield loss (AYL), aggressivity (A) and competition ratio (CR). LER, ATER and K values were greater than 1 for gourd-cassava (6:24). These findings indicate an advantage of intercropping for exploiting the resources of the environment. Cassava clones were more competitive than gourd component.

Adjusting crop planting distance and planting density to improve the yield and productivity of intercropping systems has become an important management practice around the globe. However, little is known about the response of the sweet potato yield and photosynthetic characteristics to intercropping with walnut saplings. Field experiments were conducted in a split-plot arrangement, e.g., three plant densities (D1, low, 4 plants/m(2); Dm, moderate, 8 plants/m(2); and Dh, high, 12 plants/m(2)) were randomly assigned (subplot) to three planting distances (P1, 0.25 n; P2, 0.5 n; and P3, n) (main plot). The results showed that with increasing plant distance, the yield of high-density sweet potatoes decreased significantly (P < 0.05). However, the highest sweet potato fresh root tuber yield (FRTY) appeared in the combination of P1Dh (plant distance: 0.25 n; plant density: 12 plants m(2)). Our data further suggested that under the planting distance of P1 (0.25 n) or P2 (0.5 n), soil moisture content increased significantly (approximately 3%) with planting density (P < 0.05). The net photosynthetic rate (P-n) of sweet potatoes was significantly improved in cases of high sweet potato density and a short distance between sweet potatoes and walnut saplings, which ultimately increased yield. For the walnut saplings and sweet potatoes, a more compact planting distance was associated with higher values of P-n, T-r and G(s). Based on yield performance, photosynthetic traits and walnut sapling growth, the combination of 12 plants/m(2) and P1 is the optimal scheme for walnut/sweet potato intercropping systems."

J	"Keba, W; Tolemariam, T; Mohammed, A"				"Keba, Wakgari; Tolemariam, Taye; Mohammed, Abdo"			Evaluation of Grain/Seed Yield and Yield Components of Finger Millet and Three Vetch Species Intercropped at Various Seeding Ratios at Bako, Ethiopia	ADVANCES IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article							"PRODUCTIVITY; SMALLHOLDER; SYSTEMS; SORGHUM; MAIZE"	Production of finger millet and vetch species in Ethiopia targets mostly on sole cropping system without considering the relative performance of varieties of varying seeding ratios under finger millet/vetch intercropping. Thus, this study was conducted to evaluate grain yield and yield components of three vetch species and finger millet intercropped at different seeding ratios. Factorial combination of three vetch species and five seeding ratios (0 : 100, 25 : 75, 50 : 50, 75 : 25, and 100 : 0% finger millet: vetch) were laid out in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. Analysis of variance showed that intercropping had a significant (P < 0.05) effect on plant height, heads per plant, fingers per head, and grain yield of finger millet. The highest grain yield (2058.75 kg ha(-1)) of finger millet was harvested from a treatment combination of 75% finger millet + 25% Vicia villosa. Analysis of variance also showed that plant height, leaves per plant, branches per plant, pods per plant, seeds per pod, and seed yield of vetch species had significantly varied (P < 0.05) for the tested treatments. Maximum and minimum seed yields (236.19 and 106.45 kg ha(-1)) of vetch were harvested from 25% finger millet + 75% Vicia sativa and 75% finger millet + 25% Vicia villosa, respectively. LER and RCC were improved due to intercropping different species of vetch with finger millet at various seeding ratios. The highest total LER (1.146) and RCC (3.00) were obtained from 75% finger millet + 25% Vicia villosa. Thus, it can be concluded that in Bako and similar agroecologies, where feed shortage is a critical problem, intercropping of 75% finger millet + 25% Vicia villosa can be used to alleviate the existing feed shortage in smallholder farming system.

Indigenous knowledge of the traditional vegetable pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima/moschata) from Zimbabwe	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						"Pumpkin; traditional vegetables; landraces; indigenous knowledge; Zimbabwe and participatory approaches"		A survey was conducted in four districts of Manicaland province of Zimbabwe on pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima or Cucurbita moschata) to document ethnobotanical knowledge of the pumpkin and to identify the local landraces. Informal surveys for key informants, formal surveys and focus group discussions and other participatory rural appraisal approaches were used in the study. Seven distinct landraces of pumpkin were identified by local names as Nzunzu, Ditimanga, Ndodo, Hokore, Musatani, Dasanana, and Muzwere. Landrace Nzunzu was the most popular followed by Ditimanga and Ndodo. The most prevalent landraces by area were Nzunzu (65% of respondents), followed by Ditimanga, Hokore and Musatani. One landrace (Musatani), was specifically grown by the local people as a leafy vegetable mainly and was available all year round. Landrace Nzunzu had large variegated fruit while Ditimanga has large creamy yellow to white fruit. Landraces Nzunzu, Hokore and Ndodo have variegated leaves perceived to be resistant to powdery mildew while the rest of the landraces had plain leaves. The pumpkin is grown mostly in intercrops mainly with maize, (85% respondents) and was planted and grown mainly in summer (67%) as the crop is damaged by frost. Pumpkin is mainly fertilized by cattle manure and most respondents ( 62%) do not apply an N side dress to the crop. Leaf harvest started 2 - 3 weeks after emergence in landraces such as  Nzunzu and  Ditimanga while the other landraces can be started at about 4 weeks after emergence. The pumpkin leaves are consumed 3 - 4 times a week during the rainy season. The main problem during production of pumpkin was insect pests and diseases. Farmers use mainly retained seed (71.9%) for planting that is stored in any available container in the home. This study highlighted local indigenous knowledge of pumpkins and established a baseline of the cultural practices carried out by smallholder farmers.

Compared with the monoculture, intercropping with S. nigrum increased the biomass of grape seedlings, but intercropping with the other three hyperaccumulator species decreased the grape seedling biomass. Intercropping with S. nigrum increased chlorophyll a and total chlorophyll contents in leaves of grape seedlings compared with the monoculture, whereas intercropping with the other three hyperaccumulator species showed either a decrease or no effect. Intercropping with hyperaccumulator plants had no significant effects on chlorophyll b and carotenoid contents in leaves of grape seedlings compared with the monoculture. Compared with the monoculture, intercropping with C. crepidioides, G. parviflora, S. nigrum and S. orientalis significantly decreased Cd contents in shoots of grape seedlings by 78.7%, 12.7%, 29.8% and 26.5%, respectively. Therefore, intercropping with hyperaccumulator plants can decrease Cd accumulation in grape, and intercropping with S. nigrum can also promote grape seedling growth.

False beliefs on the socio-economic drivers of cassava cropping	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						"food security; income; input use; labour; wealth classes; weed management"	"SUSTAINABILITY; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; AFRICA; KENYA; EAST"	General belief has it that cassava is (i) a subsistence crop, grown to avoid hunger (ii) by poor farmers, (iii) predominantly as an intercrop, (iv) requiring less labour than other crops and (v) no inputs. These beliefs influence policy, project development and implementation, and if wrong, may have far-reaching consequences for the success and sustainability of interventions. This study examines five beliefs about cassava and discusses consequences for interventions targeting cassava. From 2004 to 2006, 120 detailed farm surveys were carried out with smallholder farmers in 6 sites in central/eastern Uganda and western Kenya, whereby households were categorised in three wealth categories by local key informants. Through structured interviews and field visits, details on the importance of cassava, socio-economic indicators, food security, crop management and labour aspects were obtained. Our results show that cassava does ensure food security, but that the other beliefs are either myths or half truths. Besides supplying 27-41% of starchy staple food consumption, cassava also provided significant income (84 US$ yr(-1)), similar to that of maize (90 US$ yr(-1)). It is too simplistic to classify cassava as a 'poor man's crop' as in Uganda wealthier households marketed more (+16%), but in Kenya consumed less (-11%) cassava than poorer farmers. Cassava is not predominantly intercropped (30% of acreage in Uganda and 51% in Kenya), farmers do use inputs on cassava (36% of the households hire labour) and total labour requirements (287 mandays ha(-1)) were higher than for most crops. Contrary to expectations, we conclude that increasing cassava production will not improve food security - unless a disease epidemic is present - but instead will improve the scope for commercialisation of cassava. To ensure that projects designed to enhance cassava production benefit poor and/or labour deficit households, specific provisions are needed, including development of labour saving technologies.

The study was carried out in Eldorado do Sul, RS, Brazil, after 27 years of implantation of an experiment evaluating the following crop systems: O/C, oat/corn; V/C, vetch/corn; OV/C, oat + vetch/corn; OV/CP, oat + vetch/corn + cowpea; and L/M, lablab/corn. A randomized complete block design was used, with three replicates. Samplings of fauna, performed with pitfalls, and of microbiological attributes were done after cover crop management, in spring; during corn crop cycle, in summer; after corn crop harvest, in autumn; and during cover crop cycle, in winter. The inclusion of legume intercropped or in succession to cover crops promoted the occurrence of edaphic fauna and increased microbial biomass C and N, which favored cycling potential and nutrient availability. The O/C cover crop system with grasses favored the Diptera, Hemiptera, and Diplopoda orders. Overall, the best cover crop systems under no tillage are those with legume inclusion."

The gram pod borer, Helicovera armigera (Hubner) is the major biotic constraint in the production of gram and causes heavy crop losses (20-60%) throughout the India. The damage caused by pod borer starts from early stages and continues up to the vegetative growth, flowering, poding and till maturity of the crop. The larvae of pod borer feeds on the leaves, stem, pods and the seeds of gram, yield losses mainly occurred due to the pod damage. A single larva can destroy 30-40 pods before attaining the maturity. Cultural practices like use of different intercrop combinations might be successful in avoiding or reducing the pod borer infestation. The current study was aimed to find out the best possible intercrop combination for the management of pod borer in chickpea. Methods: A field experiment was conducted at research farm, College of Agriculture, SKRAU, Bikaner during Rabi, 2014-15 and 2015-16 to study the impact of different intercrop combinations in the management of gram pod borer, in chickpea. Result: The intercrops, viz., wheat, barley, mustard, linseed and safflower with chickpea significantly reduced the population of H. armigera over the sole crop of chickpea. The minimum larval population and pod damage was observed in chickpea+ safflower intercrop combination, whereas, the maximum was observed in chickpea+linseed. The highest equivalent yield (11.93 q ha(-1)) was computed in chickpea+barley, whereas, minimum (10.17 q ha(-1)) being in chickpea+linseed intercrop combination.

This study evaluated the impact of grass-legume intercropping, during the pasture phase of integrated crop-livestock systems under no-tillage (ICLS-NT), on soil microbiota, pasture quality, and soybean productivity in the Brazilian Cerrado. We evaluated the effect of intercropping on total soil contents of organic carbon and nitrogen, soil microbial activity, animal and soybean productivity (2017 and 2018 crop seasons), and pasture production and quality. The experiment consisted of twelve treatments under grass-legume intercropping in the pasture phase of ICLS-NT. The grasses Urochloa ruziziensis 'Kennedy', U. brizantha 'Paiagu ' as', Panicum maximum 'Tamani' and U. brizantha 'Piata similar to' were grown in monoculture and intercropped with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) 'Tumucumaque' or pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) 'Mandarin'. A randomized block design, with three repetitions, was used in a split-plot arrangement, considering the grasses as plots and the legumes as subplots. The results showed that ICLS-NT improved the activity of soil microbial biomass when compared to monoculture systems. Grass-legume intercropping during the pasture phase, mainly with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), increased soybean productivity, and grass dry matter. Total organic carbon (TOC), carbon management index (CMI%), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), soil basal respiration (BR), and metabolic quotient (Qmic) are the most sensitive markers when it comes to the effects of intercropping on soil microbiological activity and soybean productivity in ICLS-NT. Identifying the best grass-legume combinations allows the establishment of more productive crop-livestock integration systems under no-tillage better adapted to the bio-edaphoclimatic conditions of the Brazilian Cerrado.

The objectives of this study were (1) to compare biomass production and N accumulation by a mixture of red and white clovers intercropped with barley, and oat, field pea and oilseed radish grown as catch crops after barley harvest, (2) to determine the capacity of different CCs to catch and transfer fertilizer N (mineral or pig slurry) to subsequent wheat and the soil reserve, and (3) to determine the influence of CC type on yield of spring wheat in the next year. A 2-y crop rotation (barley ? wheat) was repeated twice on a sandy loam using 15N-labelled fertilizers applied at the time of CC establishment. Fertilization increased above-ground biomass yield in oat and oilseed radish, but had little effect on legume CCs. The legume CCs accumulated more total N in their biomass (63?127 kg N ha-1) than non-legume CCs (47?68 kg N ha-1). However, oat and oilseed radish were more efficient at capturing the applied fertilizer 15N (33?51 %) than legume CCs (2?36 %). Intercropped clovers resulted in the largest increases in subsequent wheat yields (23?92 %), followed by oilseed radish and field pea. At the end of the 2-y rotation (wheat harvest), the recovery of fertilizer 15N by subsequent wheat was < 10 %, whereas 26?60 % were still present in the 0-30 cm soil layer. We conclude that non-legume CCs have a good capacity to capture applied fertilizer N, whereas legume CCs (especially clovers) had a limited capacity. Nevertheless, clovers CC resulted in the greatest wheat yields in the following year, likely due to efficent transfer of symbiotically fixed N and improved soil quality, whereas fertilizer N captured by non-legume CCs was mainly routed to the soil N reserve, with potential to supply N to subsequent crops through a legacy effect.

Three cultivars were grown over a three-year period as sole crops and intercropped with winter pea at halved wheat density. The root capacitance readings were converted into saturation root electrical capacitance using the relevant soil water content, according to an empirical function. At plant scale, saturation root electrical capacitance at anthesis showed a significant (p < 0.001) linear regression with the total aboveground biomass (R-2: 0.653-0.765) and grain yield (R-2: 0.585-0.686) at maturity for each cultivar. At stand scale, both the mean saturation root electrical capacitance and shoot dry mass at anthesis and grain yield varied over the years, and were consistently higher for the intercrops compared to the sole crops. The relative increase in saturation root electrical capacitance due to intercropping corresponded with the changes in shoot dry mass and grain yield, especially in dry years. Saturation root electrical capacitance was significantly correlated with shoot dry mass (R-2: 0.714-0.899) and grain yield (R-2: 0.742-0.877) for each cultivar across all cropping systems and years. In conclusion, by mitigating the soil water content effect, the measurement of saturation root electrical capacitance at anthesis is adequate to forecast grain yield and cultivar response to a changing environment.

We assessed linkages of soil properties and unculturable diazotrophs community under three cultivation systems (monoculture sugarcane, peanut-sugarcane and soybean-sugarcane intercropping). Rhizosphere soil of sugarcane was sampled and DNA was extracted. We amplified the nifH gene and sequenced by high throughput sequencing. The bioinformatics analysis of sequenced data obtained a total of 436,458 nifH gene reads that are classified into 3201 unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs). A higher percentage of exclusive OTUs identified under soybean-sugarcane intercropping (< 375). The microbial structure results showed that Alpha-proteobacteria and Beta-proteobacteria were the dominant groups in all three cultivation systems. While genus such as Bradyrhizobium, Burkholderia, Pelomonas, and Sphingomonas was predominant in the intercropping systems and these diazotrophic bacterial communities were positively correlated to the soil pH and soil enzyme protease. Additionally, a lower quantity of available P in the soil of intercrops indicated a strong link between soil nutrients uptake and microbial activity. The results of the present study concluded some interesting facts of intercropping systems that positively improved the soil microbial activity and this kind of strategy could help to cultivate multiple crops to improve the economic growth of the country by sustainable sugarcane production.

However, plant shading is a major abiotic stress factor that influences soybean growth and development. Although shade affects leaf morphological parameters and decreases leaf photosynthesis capacity, information on the responses of soybean leaf photosynthesis to shading at proteomic level is still lacking. Results: Compared with leaves under normal light (CK) treatment, leaves under shading treatment exhibited decreased palisade and spongy tissue thicknesses but significantly increased cell gap. Although shade increased the number of the chloroplast, the thickness of the grana lamella and the photosynthetic pigments per unit mass, but the size of the chloroplast and starch grains and the rate of net photosynthesis decreased compared with those of under CK treatment. A total of 248 differentially expressed proteins, among which 138 were upregulated, and 110 were downregulated, in soybean leaves under shading and CK treatments were detected via isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification labeling in the three biological repeats. Differentially expressed proteins were classified into 3 large and 20 small groups. Most proteins involved in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, photosynthesis-antenna proteins and carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms were upregulated. By contrast, proteins involved in photosynthesis were downregulated. The gene family members corresponding to differentially expressed proteins, including protochlorophyllide reductase (Glyma06g247100), geranylgeranyl hydrogenase (Ggh), LHCB1 (Lhcb1) and ferredoxin (N/A) involved in the porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, photosynthesis-antenna proteins and photosynthesis pathway were verified with real-time qPCR. The results showed that the expression patterns of the genes were consistent with the expression patterns of the corresponding proteins. Conclusions: This study combined the variation of the soybean leaf structure and differentially expressed proteins of soybean leaves under shading. These results demonstrated that shade condition increased the light capture efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) in soybean leaves but decreased the capacity from PSII transmitted to photosystem II (PSI).

The experiment was carried out in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, on a dystrophic Oxisol, in which grasses (Megathyrsus maximus 'BRS Tamani' and Urochloa brizantha 'BRS Piata'), intercropped with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata 'BRS Tumucumaque') and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan 'BRS Mandarim'), were cultivated after soybean harvest. A randomized complete block design was used, with three replicates, in a split-plot arrangement, in which grasses were considered as plots, and legumes as subplots. Legume intercrops provided increases of C and total N stocks. The intercrops caused the increase of C and N of the microbial biomass, whereas the single cultures contributed to stress in the soil microbiota. The activity of the urease enzyme was sensitive to management changes in the short term, but acid phosphatase and beta-glucosidase were poorly sensitive indicators. Soil quality is high with intercropping between grasses and legumes, with positive effects on soybean grain yield.

The intercropped plants Dill, Anethum graveolens L.; coriander, Coriandrum sativum L.; and buckwheat, Fagopyrum escuelentum Moench; were established on the edge of two pepper plots and compared with nonintercropped control plots. Predation by the three species Orius insidiosus Say; Coleomegilla maculata DeGeer; and Chrysoperla, sp. Stephens, was monitored by installing O. nubilalis egg masses on sentinel plants in 2008, 2009, and 2010. To assess negative impacts of alternative prey on O. nubilalis egg predation, green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer) populations were monitored via whole-plant counts in 2009 and 2010. Myzus persicae densities on pepper plants peaked in June or July and then declined rapidly. Predation on O. nubilalis eggs increased rapidly after aphid populations declined. Aphid populations were reduced in two out of three field-seasons in intercropped plots. Seasonal predation by O. insidiosus was significantly higher in the intercropped system four out of five field-seasons and one field season by C. maculata. Results indicate that biocontrol of O. nubilalis can be improved by intercropping with flowering plants, although this capacity may depend on the abundance of alternative prey."	"[Bickerton, M.

The treatments consisted of lettuce with black oats, lettuce with cowpea, lettuce with white lupin and monocropped lettuce (control). Green manures were sown at two different times including the following: 60 days before transplanting of lettuce seedlings and simultaneous to transplanting of lettuce seedlings. N transfer was estimated using the natural (15)N abundance method. It was observed that lettuce intercropped with green manures reached the same fresh mass of monocropped lettuce when the green manures were sown at the same time as the vegetables were planted. However, when the green manures were sown previously, the fresh mass of the monocropped lettuce was higher, and independent of the sowing time of green manures, the monocropped lettuce reached a higher dry mass. White lupin and cowpea transferred higher amounts of N regardless of sowing time, and the C:N ratio of white lupin to cowpea was lower compared to black oats. Intercropping with white lupin, cowpea and black oat transferred 18, 17 and 7% of N, respectively, to lettuce.

The lettuce fresh and dry weight, number of leaves per plant, diameter and length of head, and fresh and dry weight of green manure were evaluated. The intercropping design was additive and both cash and cover crops were planted in rows. The experimental design was of randomized complete blocks in split plot scheme, with six replicates. The plots represented the green manure sowing days (0, 20,40 and 60 before transplanting of lettuce), and the sub-plots were assigned by cropping systems (lettuce in sole crop and intercropped with black oat, cowpea or white lupin). Simultaneous planting in the intercropping did not affect the lettuce performance. However, when the green manures were sown before lettuce, they influenced it in a negative way. Among the green manures, cowpea increased biomass and had a higher negative effect on lettuce performance compared to white lupin, which appeared to produce less competition. The sole crop and the intercropping with simultaneous planting of the green manures resulted in a better lettuce performance.

The impacts of 10-year cropping systems (wheat-cabbage sequential cropping, wheat-corn intercrop, wheat-sunflower rotation, wheat-soybean rotation) on soil enzyme properties of surface-soil (0-20 cm) were studied. Total carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur, and nine soil hydrolases related to nutrient availabilities (beta-galactosidase, alpha-galactosidase, beta-glucosidase, alpha-glucosidase, urease, protease, phosphomonoesterase, phosphodiesterase, arylsulphatase) and five enzymes kinetic characters were examined. Wheat-corn intercrop systems had higher total C, total N, total P and total S concentrations than wheat-soybean and wheat-sunflower rotation systems. Most test enzyme activities (alpha-galactosidase, beta-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucosidase, urease, protease, phosphomonoesterase and arylsulphatase) showed the highest activities under wheat-corn intercropping system. Urease, protease and phosphodiesterase activities of wheat-cabbage sequential cropping system were significantly higher than two rotation systems. The maximum reaction rates of enzymes (V-max) were higher than apparent enzyme activity, which suggests larger potential activity of enzymes, while not all kinetic parameters were adaptive as soil quality indicators in dry hilly cinnamon soil.

The legacy of stockless organic conversion strategies	ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY			English	Article						"beans; conversion; oats; organic; stockless"		Legume-containing leys are commonly used to improve soil fertility in the 2-year conversion period from conventional to organic production. While in-conversion land may be grazed, in stockless farming systems, land is effectively out of production, leading to a reduction in income and pressure on cash flow. The impacts of seven organic conversion strategies on the first organic crop (winter wheat) were previously reported. This study investigates the effect of the conversion strategies on the second (winter beans) and third (winter oats) organic crops, thereby extending the analysis throughout the first complete rotation. The strategies were (a) 2-years' red clover-ryegrass green manure, (b) 2-years' hairy vetch green manure, (c) red clover for seed production then a red clover-ryegrass green manure, (d) spring wheat undersown with red clover, then a red clover green manure, (e) spring oats, then winter beans, (f) spring wheat, then winter beans and (g) spring wheat undersown with red clover, then a barley-pea intercrop. Conversion strategy had a significant impact on organic bean yield, which ranged from 2.78 to 3.62 t ha(-1), and organic oat yield, which ranged from 3.24 to 4.17 t ha(-1). In the organic bean crop, weed abundance prior to harvest, along with soil texture, accounted for 70% of yield variation. For the oats, soil mineral nitrogen in November together with weed abundance in April accounted for 72% of the variation in yield. The impacts of conversion strategies on soil mineral nitrogen levels were still detectable 3 years after conversion. The results from this study indicate that the choice of conversion crop has important long-term implications. More exploitative conversion strategies, that is those with a higher proportion of cash cropping, had an increased weed burden and decreased levels of soil mineral nitrogen, leading to reduced yields of beans and oats, 2 and 3 years after conversion.

Each feed sample and its isolated NDF were fermented in vitro and gas production was monitored utilizing the in vitro gas production technique (IVGPT). NDS gas yield was determined by the difference between gas from the unfractioned forage and that of its respective NDF Haymaking decreased gas yield and rate of gas production from the unfractioned forage. Increasing maturity did not change the final gas volume, but reduced the rate of gas production from the NDS fraction. The rate of gas production from the NDS fraction of hay decreased on average by 2.9 ml/h compared with fresh forage. On average, haymaking reduced the gas yield from the NDS fraction by 18.70%. The curve subtraction technique can be used to study the effects of haymaking on the neutral detergent soluble fraction of forages.

The following species were sowed as intercrops after stubble tillage: Lolium multiflorum L., Lolium perenne L., Phacelia tanacetifolia Bentham, Brassica napus L., Sinapis alba L., Raphanus sativus L. var. oleiformis Pers., Lupinus albus L., Trifolium incarnatum L. and Trifolium subterraneum L. Stands of S. alba and B. napus were established also into the preceding crop stand before its harvest. Experimental plots had area of 40 m 2 each. After sowing, dominance (%) and aboveground dry mass production (kg ha(-1)) of intercrops, weeds and volunteer wheat were evaluated continually. The highest degree of weed and volunteer cover was found at the end of the vegetation period in stands of L. albus and B. napus. Stands of S. alba and P. tanacetifolia Indicated a low weed cover. Volunteer cereals were almost eliminated by S. alba and P. tanacetifolia in 2005.

J	Martin, P				Martin, P			Reducing flood risk from sediment-laden agricultural runoff using intercrop management techniques in northern France	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH			English	Article						"runoff; sheet erosion; intercrop management techniques; soil surface modification"	"SURFACE-ROUGHNESS; SOIL; SIZE; TILLAGE; WATER; LAND"	"To reduce muddy flooding in northern France, where soils are typically silty and highly sensitive to crusting, it is necessary to decrease the volumes of sediment-laden runoff coming from upslope agricultural source areas. To investigate the consequences of upslope agricultural practices on downslope muddy flooding, we compared the effects of no-tillage treatment (NT), light-duty mouldboard ploughing (PLOUG), mustard (Sinapis alba L.) intercrop (MUSTA) and superficial tillage with a cultivator applied either under dry (ECULT) or humid conditions (LCULT). The influence of these different treatments were measured on soil surface modifications and on both runoff and sheet erosion during the entire intercrop period. Field trials were conducted in the Pays de Caux (Normandie), over two years (1993-1994 and 1994-1995) under natural rainfall conditions on 20 m(2) experimental plots on Orthic Luvisols. In 1993-1994, the post-harvest field conditions were wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with pulverized straw, wheat without straw and pea (Pisum sativum L.) without straw. Only the pea post-harvest conditions were used in 1994-1995. The tortuosity index and percentage of surface area covered by vegetation, which were used for soil surface description, indicate the role played by surface cover and soil water during tillage in modifying surface roughness. In 1994-1995, due to specific agronomic and climatic conditions, the five intercrop management techniques did not differ significantly at P < 0.10 for runoff and erosion. In 1993-1994, considering average values for both the three post-harvest conditions and 10 recorded rainfall events, NT resulted in low erosion (40 kg ha(-1)) but high runoff (6.1 mm). Compared to NT, MUSTA significantly (P < 0.10) reduced runoff (1.5 mm) without significantly increasing erosion (82 kg ha(-1)); LCULT led to an increase in both runoff (12.4 mm) and erosion (301 kg ha(-1)); PLOUG increased erosion (182 kg ha(-1) but reduced runoff (3.2 mm) and ECULT increased erosion (247 kg ha(-1)) without reducing runoff (7.1 mm). These results specify the dynamics of runoff and sheet erosion, thus providing an aid for locating intercrop management techniques within a catchment basin according to the local erosive system and agronomic constraints.

Various crops, viz, linseed (Linum usitatissimum L.), Indian mustard [Brassica juncea (L.) Czernj. & Cosson], potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.), pea [Pisum sativum (L.) Poiret] and wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori & Paol.) were tried as intercrops in variable row proportions. Based on 4 seasons, results showed that intercropping adversely affected the yield of French bean, the reduction in yield being 41-73%. However, total productivity in terms of French bean equivalent was highest in French bean + potato intercropping system. This also recorded higher land-equivalent ratio (LER) to that of other intercropping systems, in 1990-91, one row of potato between paired row planting (30/45 cm) of French bean gave higher productivity than 2 rows of French bean between paired row planting (45/60 cm) of potato. In next 3 seasons, the productivity between 2 planting systems, i.e, paired row planting (40/80 cm)of potato + 2 rows of French bean and 2 rows of potato at 50 cm alternated with 3 rows of French bean at 30 cm, was almost similar except in 1991-92 where the former recorded markedly higher productivity than the fatter.

Because of the crop rotation and residue management procedures used at the study site, a substantial amount of surface cover and vegetative mass was present on each of the strips. As a result soil loss resulting from simulated rainfall applied for a one-hour duration at an intensity of approximately 64 mm/hr (2.5 in/hr) was less than or equal to 1.5 Mg/ha (0.67 tons/acre) from each of the individual and multiple strips. Thus, the strip intercropping system established an this highly erodible site provided effective erosion control.

JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY			Japanese	Article						"Tetranychus urticae; chrysanthemum; pea; dispersal; oviposition"		I studied the seasonal occurrence of the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae KOCH (green form), in chrysanthemum and pea fields and the dispersal between fields in central Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. During the summer, before pea planting, T. urticae are never observed on weeds near the pea fields. However, the mites occurred at high densities on chrysanthemums throughout the year, including the cultivation and nursery period, and move into pea fields in September. T. urticae survive and oviposit prolifically on chrysanthemum under experimental conditions, whereas T. kanzawai fail to develop to adulthood. These results show that chrysanthemums are the principal host of T. urticae, from where the mites migrate to pea fields.

A field study was conducted in Cinzana, Mali, to characterize light transmission to cowpea in sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]-cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp] intercropping systems. Different sorghum-cowpea planting configurations were used to examine photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) incident on the cowpea. The 4-m tall sorghum cultivar CSM 219E intercepted > 60 % of incoming PAR from 2 m height to harvest (50 days). Consequently, total seasonal PAR received by intercropped cowpea was 60-66 % that of the unshaded monocrop. Thirty-minute averages of PAR transmitted around solar noon had poor agreement (R-2 =0.53) with fractional daily light interception and overestimated seasonal PAR received by cowpea by 17 % in the north-south row orientation used. Thirty-minute averages at 1100 h (R-2 =0.93) and 1430 h (R-2 =0.91) had the closest correlation to diurnal average PAR incident on cowpea. This study indicates that tall guineense sorghum captures significant amounts of light at low leaf area index (LAI) (< 2.0). Row orientation, time of measurement, plant height and LAI should be considered in calculating light interception in these intercropping systems.

J	"MORRIS, RA; GARRITY, DP"				"MORRIS, RA; GARRITY, DP"			RESOURCE CAPTURE AND UTILIZATION IN INTERCROPPING - NON-NITROGEN NUTRIENTS	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article							"PLANT-POPULATION DENSITY; LUPINUS-ALBUS L; CASSAVA-COWPEA; WHITE LUPIN; PHOSPHORUS; GROWTH; MAIZE; YIELD; COMPETITION; SYSTEMS"	The capture and utilization of P and K, two non-mobile soil resources, were examined by decomposing crop production/unit area into uptake/unit area (capture) and production/unit uptake (utilization efficiency). Resource capture and utilization efficiencies by intercrops were compared to those of sole crops by contrasting intercrop means against the weighted means of sole crops. Weightings were based on the proportion of each species in the intercrop. On average, intercrops took up 43% more P (-4 to 83%) and 35% more K (-10 to 87%) than the sole crops. Where nutrients were not limiting, P and K uptake increased as dry-matter yield increased, evidence that uptake was a function of crop growth rather than conversely. Even where soil P was deficient, uptake by a dominated crop was decided more by factors that determined the outcome of competition than by P availability. The combined root systems, likely to be larger and functional for a longer duration under intercrops than under either sole crop, were postulated to explain the greater capture of non-mobile nutrients like P and K. An enlarged root system provides an expanded root surface area to which non-mobile nutrients can diffuse. For mobile nutrients which move to root surfaces largely by mass flow, shading of the dominated canopy may explain the positive association observed between intercrop dry-matter accumulation and Ca capture. Shading reduces carbon assimilation and transpiration of the understory canopy and, therefore, would reduce mass flow of Ca as well. Competition for P and K by intercropped species, even when nutrient supplies were abundant, was affected by degree of growth concurrency, canopy domination and planting geometry. When a dominating species was harvested much earlier than the dominated species, the uptake rate of the longer-duration crop usually recovered from competition after the first crop was harvested. Exceptions occurred when development of the dominated crop was so badly impaired during concurrent growth that vegetative enlargement was inhibited after harvest of the early species. Uptake rates by pigeon pea and cassava, which are exceptionally long-maturing species that have relatively low daily P and K uptake requirements, appeared capable of fully recovering even on soils in which nutrient availabilities were marginal for other species.

This study investigated the effect of intercropping on the rhizosphere soil microbial composition and structure and how this interaction affects N absorption and utilization by plants to improve crop productivity. Experiments were conducted to analyze the rhizosphere soil microbial diversity and the relationship between microbial composition and N assimilation by proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) and mung bean (Vigna radiata L.) from 2017 to 2019. Four different intercropping row arrangements were evaluated, and individual plantings of proso millet and mung bean were used as controls. Microbial diversity and community composition were determined through Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) genes. The results indicated that intercropping increased N levels in the soil-plant system and this alteration was strongly dependent on changes in the microbial (bacterial and fungal) diversities and communities. The increase in bacterial alpha diversity and changes in unique operational taxonomic unit (OTU) numbers increased the soil N availability and plant N accumulation. Certain bacterial taxa (such as Proteobacteria) and fungal taxa (such as Ascomycota) were significantly altered under intercropping and showed positive responses to increased N assimilation. The average grain yield of intercropped proso millet increased by 13.9-50.1% compared to that of monoculture proso millet. Our data clearly showed that intercropping proso millet with mung bean altered the rhizosphere soil microbial diversity and community composition; thus, this intercropping system represents a potential mechanism for promoting N assimilation and increasing grain yield."

We evaluated the effect of strip-intercropping potato and annual alfalfa on populations of Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say, predator's biodiversity and potato yield over two seasons (2014 and 2015). Our results revealed that the densities of egg masses, eggs, larvae and adults of Colorado potato beetle (CPB) were significantly lower in intercrops than in monoculture. The main CPB predators recorded on potato plants (ladybirds and the green lacewing) showed a significant increase in the density at each of the three intercrops than in monoculture. The percentage of dry tubers weight loss was 40.9%-42.6% in monoculture, 16.3%-18.7% in 6P: 2A and <10% in 2P: 2A and 4P: 2A in two studied years. Our results suggest that strip-intercropping potato with annual alfalfa, particularly in 2P: 2A and 4P: 2A patterns may be an effective way in integrated management of CPB for reducing pest density, enhancing the presence of predators in potato fields and improving potato yield.

Urb., in the combined management of Striga hermonthica and cereal stemborers in finger millet (Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn.) in western Kenya between 2007 and 2008. Treatments comprised finger millet planted either as monocrop stands or intercropped with D. intortum. S. hermonthica counts were significantly lower in the intercrop than in the monocrop plots. Similarly, multi-season analyses showed that the proportions of stemborer-damaged plants were significantly lower in the intercrop than in the monocrop. These differences were associated with significantly higher grain yields in the intercrop than in the monocrop. Total labour and variable costs were significantly higher in the intercrop resulting from the additional seed cost and labour to plant, manage and harvest D. intortum. However, total revenue and gross margins were significantly higher in the intercrop due to the higher finger millet grain yields and additional product, D. intortum forage, part of which is consumed by farmers' own livestock or used for own plot extension, and the remaining amount is sold. Our results demonstrate that intercropping finger millet with D. intortum offers an effective means of control of both pests, leading to higher grain yields and economic returns.	"[Midega, Charles A.

Sustainable Intensification with Cereal-Legume Intercropping in Eastern and Southern Africa	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						"agronomic efficiency; climate-smart agriculture; mother-baby trial; nutrient mining; trade-off"	"SMALLHOLDER FARMERS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MAIZE YIELD; PROFITABILITY; RISK; VULNERABILITY; PIGEONPEA; TERM; SOIL"	Much research has been conducted on cereal-legume intercropping as a sustainable intensification (SI) practice in Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA). However, the role of inorganic fertilizers in sustainably intensifying intercropping systems has not been systematically analyzed. Therefore, the objective of the present analysis was to assess the role of inorganic fertilizer use in cereal-pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) intercropping in terms of SI indicators, namely, yield, production risks, input use efficiency, and economic returns. The data used for this analysis were gathered from over 900 on-farm trials across Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique. All SI indicators assessed showed that intercropping combined with application of small amounts of inorganic fertilizers is superior to unfertilized intercrops. Fertilizer application in the intercropping system improved cereal yields by 71-282% and pigeon pea yields by 32-449%, increased benefit-cost ratios by 10-40%, and reduced variability in cereal yields by 40-56% and pigeonpea yields by 5-52% compared with unfertilized intercrops. Improved yields and reduced variability imply lowering farmers' risk exposure and improved credit rating, which could enhance access to farm inputs. We conclude that the strategic application of small amounts of inorganic fertilizers is essential for the productivity and economic sustainability of cereal-pigeonpea intercropping under smallholder farming in ESA.

This model needs many input variables to compute soil (r(s)(s)) and vegetation (r(s)(v)) resistances, which are often difficult to estimate at large scale particularly soil moisture. In this study, a new approach to spatialize r(s)(s) and r(s)(v) based on two thermal-based proxy variables was proposed. Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Landsat data were combined with the endmember temperatures for soil (Ts-min and Ts-max) and vegetation (Tv(min) and Tv(max)), which were simulated by a surface energy balance model, to compute the soil (Ts) and the vegetation (Tv) temperatures. Based on these temperatures, two thermal proxies (SIss for soil and SIsv for vegetation) were calculated and related to r(s)(s) and r(s)(v), with an empirical exponential relationship [with a correlation coefficient (R) of about 0.6 and 0.5 for soil and vegetation, respectively]. The proposed approach was initially evaluated at a local scale, by comparing the results to observations by an eddy covariance system installed over an area planted with olive trees intercropped with wheat. In a second step, the new approach was applied over a large area which contains a mixed vegetation (tall and short) crossed by a river to derive r(s)(s) and r(s) (v), and thereafter to estimate ET. A Large aperture scintillometer (LAS) installed over a line transect of 1.4 km and spanning the total area was used to validate the obtained ET. The comparison confirmed the ability of the proposed approach to provide satisfactory ET maps with an RMSE, bias and R-2 equal to 0.08 mm/h, 0.06 mm/h and 0.80, respectively.

Intercropping systems, in which onion or garlic were planted on the side of cucumber in the first growing season, were compared to cucumber monoculture. Only cucumber was planted in the second and third growing seasons in order to see if the impacts of intercropping in the first growing season still exist in later growing seasons. Results showed that cucumber yield increased under both intercropping systems in these three growing seasons, compared with monoculture. Increases of soil urease activities under intercropping systems were detected in these three growing seasons. Soil polyphenol oxidase activities under intercropping systems also increased in the first two growing seasons. Soil catalase activity was higher under garlic-cucumber intercropping systems than under monoculture in the last two growing seasons. PCR-DGGE analysis showed that soil bacterial community band numbers and diversity indices decreased with growing seasons under monoculture. These indices were relatively stable under intercropping systems throughout these three growing seasons, and were higher than under monoculture. Garlic-cucumber system had a more obvious effect on soil fungal community structure than onion-cucumber system. This study demonstrated that intercropping cucumber with onion or garlic increased cucumber productivity and improved soil environment at different levels. These impacts of intercropping still existed in the second and third growing seasons. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

However, how these two crop species compete for resources by stimulating root development and water uptake is unknown. An experiment was conducted at the Northwest A&F University experimental site in northwestern China from 2017 to 2019 to investigate the mechanisms governing the yield responses of both crops and compare interspecific interactions by analyzing the root distribution and water-use efficiency (WUE) of the crops. Intercropped proso millet dominated, as indicated by the highly positive aggressivity (Apm; averaging 1.66) and relative crowding coefficient (Kpm; averaging 2.66). The root growth and distribution of both crops increased under intercropping, with lateral expansion to the middle interrow spaces during the cogrowth period, resulting in greater root length density, surface area density, and volume density in the upper layer (0-50 cm) and close to the plants. This allowed the absorption of more soil water, which helped increase the WUE of intercropped proso millet. These improvements occurred due to significant correlations between soil water content and root structure. However, the relatively short mung bean was shaded by the taller proso millet, creating a disadvantage reflected by the decreased plant biomass and WUE of the former. Compared with grain yield under monocultures, the grain yield of the intercropped proso millet and mung bean increased by 13.9-50.0 % and decreased by 31.9-47.0 %, respectively. Two rows of proso millet intercropped with four rows of mung bean (2P4M) is recommended, as this system, although reducing mung bean yields, increases proso millet yields and enables the greatest land-use efficiency in arid regions of Northwest China."

Does intercropping play a role in alleviating weeds in cassava as a non-chemical tool of weed management? - A review	CROP PROTECTION			English	Review						"Cassava; Intercropping; Competition; Weed control; Compatibility"	"POPULATION-DENSITY; GUINEA SAVANNA; MANIHOT-ESCULENTA; CROPPING SYSTEMS; COVER CROPS; GROWTH; MAIZE; COWPEA; YIELD; SOIL"	Cassava is an important root and tuber crop in the tropics which requires intensive weed management at its early growth stages. This review emphasizes the potential of exploiting the option of intercropping as a non-chemical tool of weed management in cassava. The appropriateness and the significance of including intercropping solely and as a component of an integrated weed management system in cassava are further discussed. Literature suggests that intercropping is a successful option in managing weeds when the spatial and temporal compatibility of intercrop combinations is being achieved. In widespread cassava-based intercropping systems, intercropping itself has proven its ability to alleviate weeds up to 30-60%, or even up to 100% with the selection of a better compatible crop mixture such as the cassava pumpkin intercrop combination. A number of studies conducted to ascertain the appropriate spatial and temporal compatibility levels of many intercrop combinations have provided evidence of their weed suppressive ability in cassava-based intercropping systems. The focus of such studies towards the basic agronomic, physiological and biochemical determinants of crop-weed interactions seems rather constricted. In conclusion, intercropping is suggested to be exploited as an effective weed management tool in cassava preferably through further research, prior to endorsing it as a proper alternative to chemical weed control measures, especially for the resource poor farmers who probably can neither afford herbicides nor labour-intensive cultural methods for weed management.

This field study tested binary mixtures of two cereals {sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] and pearl millet [Cenchrus americanus (L.) Morrone]} and three forage legumes {cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.], cluster bean [Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taub.], and soybean[Glycine max (L.) Merr.]}, along with their sole crops on competitive indices. Sorghum-cowpea binary mixture resulted in a lower green forage yield of sorghum and cowpea by 9 and 36%, respectively, but overall biomass production was increased by 30 and 117% compared to their sole crop equivalents. Partial land equivalent ratios (LER) of all component crops were higher than 0.50, indicating better land use efficiency, except of soybean in binary mixtures with cowpea and cluster bean. However, the highest LER was of sorghum-cowpea (1.55), followed by sorghum-soybean (1.48) and pearl millet-soybean (1.48) binary mixtures. Pearl millet dominated sorghum and all legumes, while cowpea remained a superior competitor among legumes as per aggressivity value (AV) index. The highest crowding ratio (CR) was exhibited by pearl millet in binary mixture with cluster bean indicating its higher competitive ability in comparison to other mixture components. Observed yield loss data indicated that pearl millet was the most resistant crop to yield loss in all binary mixtures, while soybean had the highest yield reduction. In a short term, the highest area time equivalent ratio (ATER) for sorghum-cowpea binary mixture indicated the maximum advantage for this binary mixture compared to other binary mixtures.

In addition, farmers normally apply inorganic fertilisers to legumes to activate soil-bound phosphorus using root exudates. Sufficient soil mineral nutrition is key to sustainable crop production, and hence food and nutritional security. The aim of this study was to quantify the acid and alkaline phosphatase activity as an indicator of P supply and availability under varying levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) fertilization and different cropping systems. An intercropping (cowpea and amaranth) and fertiliser (control, 25%, 50%, and 100% of the recommended NPK levels) field trial was laid out in a 2 x 4 factorial treatment structure in a completely randomized design (CRD) with four replications. There was higher acid and alkaline phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere of cowpea and amaranth grown as sole crops compared to those from intercropping. The cowpea and amaranth plants grown without fertiliser or 25% NPK had the highest rhizospheric phosphatase activity, while 100% NPK application exhibited the least. The markedly higher phosphatase activity from the low fertiliser application treatments indicates the possible stimulation of microbial activity to supplement P demands for the crops. The study revealed that the application of lower rates inorganic fertilisers in a legume intercrop stimulates the activity of the phosphatase enzymes, which can subsequently liberate soil-bound phosphorus. Plant tissue phosphorus concentration of cowpea and amaranth plants increased proportionately to the increase in fertiliser application up to 50% of the recommended NPK level. The land equivalent ratio (LER) was greater than 1, indicating that it is more beneficial to intercrop cowpea and amaranth as opposed to growing them as sole crops. Overall, the application of NPK fertilizer to amounts of up to 50%, based on the results of this study, appear to be better than 100% in terms of biomass accumulation and phosphate activity.

Treatments included two farming systems (high input and organic) and different intercropping patterns that alternated bitter vetch (Vicia ervilia L.) and safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) with row ratios of 2:2, 3:2, 4:2 and 5:2. Sole cropping of bitter vetch and safflower was used as the control. In both years, the 2:2 intercropping pattern had biomass yield advantages compared to sole cropping and the other intercropping ratios, based on greater land equivalent ratio values. Safflower had higher relative crowding coefficients, competitive ratio (CR) and aggressivity (A) values than bitter vetch. High-input farming was more effective than the organic system in both years. Safflower was the superior competitor when grown with bitter vetch, and its productivity dominated the total biomass yields. Thus, intercropping of safflower with bitter vetch has the potential to improve performance with high land-use efficiency.

Integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) aims at increased productivity through the combined use of improved germplasm, judicious fertilizer application and organic matter management, adapted to the local farming conditions. We hypothesize that the application of these different ISFM components can result in significant increases in productivity and economic benefits of cassava-legume intercropping systems. Participatory demonstration trials were conducted in the highlands of Sud-Kivu, DR Congo with 12 farmer groups during 3 seasons. Treatments included the farmers' common practice (local common bean and cassava varieties, seed broadcast and manure addition) and sequentially added ISFM components: improved bean and cassava germplasm, modified crop arrangements, compound NPK fertilizer application and alternative legume species (groundnut or soybean). The use of improved germplasm did not result in yield increases without simultaneous implementation of other ISFM components. Modifying the crop arrangement by planting cassava at 2 m between rows and 0.5 m within the row, intercropped with four legume lines, increased bean yields during the first season and permits a second bean intercrop, which can increase total legume production by up to 1 t ha(-1) and result in an additional revenue of almost 1000 USD ha(-1). Crop arrangement or a second legume intercrop did not affect cassava storage root yields. Fertilizer application increased both legume and cassava yield, and net revenue by 400-700 USD ha(-1) with a marginal rate of return of 1.6-2.7. Replacing the common bean intercrop by groundnut increased net revenue by 200-400 USD ha(-1) partly because of the higher market value of the grains, but mostly due to a positive effect on cassava storage root yield. Soybean affected cassava yields negatively because of its high biomass production and long maturity period; modifications are needed to integrate a soybean intercrop into the system. The findings demonstrate the large potential of ISFM to increase productivity in cassava-legume systems in the Central-African highlands. Benefits were, however, not observed in all study sites. In poor soils, productivity increases were variable or absent, and soil amendments are required. A better understanding of the conditions under which positive effects occur can enable better targeting and local adaptation of the technologies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Alternative cropping systems to control soil erosion in the arid to semi-arid areas of Jordan	ARID LAND RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						"land degradation; land equivalent ratio; NDVI; sprinkler irrigation; strip intercropping; surface crust; transitional Badia"	"RUNOFF; SORGHUM; YIELD; MAIZE; CORN"	Land degradation caused by water erosion affects large areas of the world. In the arid regions, erosion is accentuated by fragile environmental conditions and limited economic and/or technical mitigation alternatives. Cropping systems are seen as promising tools. A 2-year experiment was conducted at Jordan University Station for Arid Land Research at Muwaqqar to investigate the influence of plant densities (250, 300, and 350 plants m(-2)) under different cropping systems (sole cropping, traditional sole cropping-up- and-down the slope-and contour strip intercropping) of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) yields, soil and water losses. Average intercropping yields of vetch and barley were significantly increased (by more than 50%), especially at plant density of 350 plants m-2 as compared to their sole crops planted under similar plant density. This increase in yield was generally associated with a reduction in water and soil losses. Traditional sole cropping gave the highest significant runoff coefficients (above 0.30), and the lowest significant yields. Runoff coefficients were reduced to 0.17 as a result of planting barley and vetch under contour strip intercropping at a plant density of 350 plants m(-2). The average land equivalent ratios (LER) for most intercropping treatments were greater than one, which indicates the superiority of intercropping over the sole cropping system. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was highly correlated with yields, water, and to some extent, soil losses. This indicated the possibility of using remote sensing to build an inventory of spatial and temporal variation of vegetation cover to serve land degradation mitigation efforts.

Crop response under such high-rainfall conditions is to increase dry matter investment in vegetative parts rather than reproductive parts. In the case of soybean, leaf redundancy prevails, which reduces the light transmittance and seed yield. However, moderate defoliation of soybean canopy could reduce leaf redundancy and improve soybean yield, especially under high-rainfall conditions. Therefore, the effects of three defoliation treatments (T-1, 15%; T-2, 30%; and T-3, 45% defoliation from the top of the soybean canopy; defoliation treatments were applied at the pod initiation stage of soybean) on the growth and yield parameters of soybean were evaluated through field experiments in the summer of 2017, 2018, and 2019. All results were compared with nondefoliated soybean plants (CK) under high-rainfall conditions. Compared with CK, treatment T-1 significantly (p < 0. 05) improved the light transmittance and photosynthetic rate of soybean. Consequently, the leaf greenness was enhanced by 22%, which delayed the leaf senescence by 13% at physiological maturity. Besides, compared to CK, soybean plants achieved the highest values of crop growth rate in T-1, which increased the total dry matter accumulation (by 6%) and its translocation to vegetative parts (by 4%) and reproductive parts (by 8%) at physiological maturity. This improved soybean growth and dry matter partitioning to reproductive parts in T-1 enhanced the pod number (by 23%, from 823.8 m(-2) in CK to 1012.7 m(-2) in T-1) and seed number (by 11%, from 1181.4 m(-2) in CK to 1311.7 m(-2) in T-1), whereas the heavy defoliation treatments considerably decreased all measured growth and yield parameters. On average, treatment T-1 increased soybean seed yield by 9% (from 2120.2 kg ha(-1) in CK to 2318.2 kg ha(-1) in T-1), while T-2 and T-3 decreased soybean seed yield by 19% and 33%, respectively, compared to CK. Overall, these findings indicate that the optimum defoliation, i.e., T-1 (15% defoliation), can decrease leaf redundancy and increase seed yield by reducing the adverse effects of mutual shading and increasing the dry matter translocation to reproductive parts than vegetative parts in soybean, especially under high-rainfall conditions. Future studies are needed to understand the internal signaling and the molecular mechanism controlling and regulating dry matter production and partitioning in soybean, especially from the pod initiation stage to the physiological maturity stage."

The castor beans has draw the attention as a promising crop for biodiesel production, and being suggested by federal authorities as a primary choice in family run small farmer's agricultural projects.

Bean cultivar Perola yield best when intercropped as well as when single crop. Castor bean cultivar Paraguacu performed similarly in both cropping systems. Bean yield decreased in the intercropping, but in the range of 38 to 71% was more efficient than in single crop.

Haw; Agronomic performance; Economic profitability"	"YIELD; MAIZE; COWPEA; COTTON"	The objective of this study was to evaluate the productive and economic performance of a forage cactus and sorghum intercropping system in relation to a forage cactus single cropping system under different irrigation blades with saline water. The study was conducted in Serra Talhada, State of Pernambuco, in a randomized block design, consisting of a factorial arrangement with split-plot parcels (5x2) and four replications. The five plots were the irrigation depths based on the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) (0, 8.75, 17.5, 26.25, and 35% ETo) and the two cropping systems were single forage cactus cropping and cactus intercropped with sorghum. The experiment was conducted for one year, with one forage cactus cycle and two cycles of sorghum. Yields were obtained at the end of the cycles. Economic profitability was analyzed by means of net revenue (NR) and the benefit/cost ratio (B/C), with cactus forage sold as forage or as seed and sorghum as forage. Net revenue and B/C simulations were carried out over an eight-year useful life span of the irrigation system. Increasing irrigation depth increased the dry matter yield of the intercropping system because of higher sorghum yield. Based on the NR and B/C ratio values, forage cactus and sorghum produced as forage produced higher economic outcomes in the intercropping system and showed a higher profitability from the 2nd year of implementation of the irrigation system. Forage cactus and sorghum intercropping irrigated with saline water is therefore recommended for forage production in the Brazilian semi-arid region.

Yellowsarson + gram at 1 : 2 arrangement proved the best. However, sole gram gave the highest productivity (1 877 kg/ha) among all the treatments. For yellow sarson-yield and safflower-yield equivalents, sole gram gave the highest values (2 120 and 2 665 kg/ha respectively). The net return/Re invested was the highest with sole lentil (4.13), and among the intercrops yellow sarson-based systems gave the lowest return (Rs 1.95-3.18) compared with safflower-based ones (Rs 2.23-3.31). The coefficient of oilseed crops (safflower and yellow sarson) was always higher than 1 (1.825-4.911) indicating that the actual yields in intercrops were more than expected; whereas that of gram and lentil intercropped with safflower was always less than 1 (0.510-0.820). The coefficients of these 2 pulses were more than 1 when intercropped with yellow sarson. The relative crowding coefficient value was always > 1, indicating advantage in yield. The highest value of land-equivalent ratio (1.223) was achieved by yellow sarson + gram (1 : 1) and the highest area-time equivalent ratio (1.11) by yellow sarson + lentil (1 : 1).

Supply Chain Perspectives on Breeding for Legume-Cereal Intercrops	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						"breeding strategies; crop mixtures; intercrop-adapted genotypes; legume-cereal intercropping; participatory breeding; species synergy; supply chain actors"	"INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; DIVERSITY; SYSTEMS; YIELD; FOOD; INPUT"	Compared to sole crops, intercropping-especially of legumes and cereals-has great potential to improve crop yield and resource use efficiency, and can provide many other ecosystem services. However, the beneficial effects of intercrops are often greatly dependent on the end use as well as the specific species and genotypes being co-cultivated. In addition, intercropping imposes added complexity at different levels of the supply chain. While the need for developing crop genotypes for intercropping has long been recognized, most cultivars on the market are optimized for sole cropping and may not necessarily perform well in intercrops. This paper aims to place breeding targets for intercrop-adapted genotypes in a supply chain perspective. Three case studies of legumes and cereals intercropped for human consumption are used to identify desirable intercrop traits for actors across the supply chains, many of which are not targeted by traditional breeding for sole crops, including certain seed attributes, and some of which do not fit traditional breeding schemes, such as breeding for synchronized maturity and species synergies. Incorporating these traits into intercrop breeding could significantly reduce complexity along the supply chain. It is concluded that the widespread adoption and integration of intercrops will only be successful through the inclusion and collaboration of all supply chain actors, the application of breeding approaches that take into account the complexity of intercrop supply chains, and the implementation of diversification strategies in every process from field to fork.

Herbicide use reduction is one of the goals of modern agriculture, with several alternatives being investigated, including intercropping. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of cowpea and corn cultivar intercropping on weed control and corn green-ear (immature ears with 80% humidity grains) and grain yield. A completely randomized block design with split-plots and four replications was used. AG 1051, AG 2060 and PL 6880 corn cultivars (assigned to plots) were submitted to the four treatments: no weeding, two hoe-weeding (22 and 41 days after planting), and intercropping with cowpea (BR 14 and IPA 206 cultivars, with indeterminate growth). The cowpea was planted (with corn planting) between the corn rows, in pits 1.0 m apart, with two plants per pit. The corn cultivars did not differ from each other as to weed density (WD), fresh above-ground weed biomass (WB), green-ear yield and grain yields. Higher WD and WB mean values were found in no weeding subplots; lower mean values in two hoe-weeding subplots: and intermediate mean values in intercropped subplots, indicating that cowpea plants had, to a certain extent, control over weeds. The no-weeded plots and the intercropped plots had lower green-ear and grain yields. Although the cowpea cultivars had a certain control over weeds (mean reductions of 22.5 and 18.3%, in terms of green matter density and weight of the above-ground part of weeds, respectively), they also competed against the corn plants, leading to yield reduction (mean reductions of 17.0 and 32% in green ear and grain yield, respectively). The cowpea cultivars did not produce grain, certainly due to the strong competition exerted by the corn and weeds on cowpea plants."	"[Silva, P. S. L.; Oliveira, O. F.; Braga, J.

Shortages in irrigation water and fertile land are some of the major constraints in saffron production especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Saffron growers can make a clean and sustainable benefit of the saffron inter-row spaces through the novel strategy of winter-wheat/saffron-base intercropping system. Effects of four different irrigation regimes vis., 40, 60, 80, and 100% of the standard saffron evapotranspiration (ETc), application of two sources of nitrogen [organic (fermented cow) manure] and chemical (granular urea)] and two cropping systems (saffron mono-cropping and saffron-wheat intercropping) on growth and yield of saffron and winter wheat were investigated during four growing seasons (2013-2017) in open-filed lysimeters with a randomized complete blocks design arranged in factorial combination with three replicates. The highest saffron and winter-wheat yields (0.48 and 355.7 g m(-2), respectively) obtained from 'manure-monocropping-60% ETc' and 'urea-60% ETc treatments', respectively, both at the fourth growing season. Results showed that saffron equivalent yield and revenue were 17% higher in intercropping treatments compared to sole saffron. Moreover, the chemical urea fertilizer decreased significantly saffron yield (20%) in comparison to the application of the organic cow manure, while an increase of 17% in wheat grain yield was experienced in urea treatments compared to manure. Under the study conditions, irrigation regime of 40%ETc could be recommended. For saffron quality, application of urea increased significantly safranal, crocin and picrocrocin concentrations as 6.0%, 3.0% and 5.0%, respectively in comparison with the manure treatments. Therefore, for higher quality of saffron, it is recommended to use nitrogen fertilizer along with manure. Besides, land equivalent ratios for economic yields were 1.74, which shows the overall 74% advantage in intercropping in production of economic (saffron and wheat grain) yields, over the four years of study. Therefore, the farmers can use the inter-row spaces of the saffron crop to grow winter wheat simultaneously in order to obtain higher revenue and land productivity, and make clean and sustainable production.

This study investigated the effect of organic/biofertilizers and intercropping patterns on the seed yield of ajowan (Carum copticum L.), fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.), and pea (Pisum sativum L.) and the essential oil and fatty acid profiles and phenolic compounds of the two medicinal and aromatic plants. The five fertilizer treatments were: no fertilizer (control), 100% chemical fertilizer (NPK), 50% chemical fertilizer+ 100% biofertilizer (CH+B), 50% chemical fertilizer + 100% humic acid (CH+H), and 100% biofertilizer + 100% humic acid (B+H). The six intercropping treatments were ajowan pure stand (Aps), fenugreek pure stand (Fps), pea pure stand (Pps), intercropping one row each of fenugreek + ajowan + pea (1 F:1 A:1 P), intercropping two rows each of fenugreek + ajowan + pea (2 F:2 A:2 P) and intercropping three rows each of fenugreek + ajowan + pea (3 F:3 A:3 P). The results showed that pure stands with CH+H fertilizer produced the highest seed yields for ajowan, fenugreek, and pea, being 29%, 25%, and 30% higher than the unfertilized control. The 2 F:2 A:2 P intercropping ratio fertilized with CH+H had the highest concentrations of ajowan essential oil (3.9%) and main chemical constituents, including thymol (51.3%) and p-cymene (19.6%). The main oil chemical constituents of ajowan included petroselinic acid (69-75.7%) oleic acid (18-23.9%), and palmitic acid (2.1-5.2%). The main chemical constituents of fenugreek oil were linoleic acid (32.4-38.9%), oleic acid (18-24.3%), linolenic acid (16.1-20.9%), and palmitic acid (7.2-14.1%). The 2 F:2 A:2 P intercropping ratio fertilized with CH+H and CH+B had the highest concentrations of coumaric and rosmarinic acids in ajowan and fenugreek, respectively. The results suggest that the 2 F:2 A:2 P intercropping ratio combined with chemical and organic fertilizer application is a more sustainable and cleaner strategy for improving secondary metabolites and fatty acid profiles in ajowan and fenugreek than pure stands.

This study aimed to analyze the impact of succession systems on the nutritional characteristics of soybean in succession. The study was conducted in the Midwest region of Parana, Brazil. The experiment was carried in randomized block design, with eight species in the autumn/winter season (spontaneous, black oat, brachiaria ruziziensis, oilseed radish, corn, wheat, black oat intercropped with radish, and corn intercropped with brachiaria ruziziensis) and four replications, with soybean cultivation in succession. The content of macronutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S) and micronutrients (B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn) in soybean leaves during the flowering period were analyzed. The data were subjected to the analysis of variance. The means were grouped by the Scott-Knott test, with a 5% probability. The data were also compared with the reference levels for soybean and with the Integrated System of Diagnosis and Recommendation (DRIS), obtaining the Nutritional Balance Index (NBI). The succession system had a significant effect (p < 0.05) on the contents of N, P, S, and Cu.

Amongst pulses, chickpea is the major crop in India but for international market the quality of this crop has to be improved which may be possible by evaluation of different planting techniques. No systematic research and adequate technologies have been reported in Punjab on intercropping of different crops in chickpea. The current study aimed to find out the effect of different intercrops on growth and yield of bed planted chickpea based intercropping systems. Methods: A field experiment was carried out during the rabi season of 2017 and 2018 to evaluate the productivity and economic viability of bed planted chickpea based intercropping systems. The experiment was laid out in a randomized block design consisting of four replications with thirteen treatments. Result: Results showed that sole chickpea recorded highest seed yield and it was statistically at par with seed yield that obtained under chickpea + oats fodder (2:1), chickpea + oats fodder (4:1) and chickpea + linseed (4:1) intercropping systems. However, oilseed rape and barley as intercrops showed adverse effect on yield and yield attributes of chickpea. Chickpea + oats fodder in 2:1 row ratio recorded highest chickpea equivalent yield of 24.07 and 24.77 q/ha and system productivity of 15.96 and 15.60 kg/ha/day during 2017 and 2018, respectively. Higher net returns (Rs. 63098 and 70924/ha), benefit cost ratio (1.47 and 1.63) and production efficiency (417.9 and 446.1 Rs/ha/day) were also recorded in chickpea + oats fodder (2:1) intercropping system over sole chickpea (Rs. 44862 and 53769/ha and 1.21 and 1.41) during both the years. Chickpea + oats fodder (4:1), chickpea + linseed (2:1) and chickpea + linseed (4:1) also recorded significantly higher chickpea equivalent yield, net returns and benefit cost ratio as compared to sole chickpea.

However, farmers are still reluctant in the use of intercropping practices since there is a huge knowledge gap regarding the time of sowing, sowing ratio, crop stand density, and cultivar choice. In this study, we carried out a 3-year field experiment in Central Italy to assess the effect of relay intercropping on the agronomic performance and competitiveness of winter durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf. cv. Minosse) and spring lentil (Lens culinaris Medik. cv. Elsa) under a low-input management system, comparing different crop stand types (monocrop vs. intercrop) and target plant densities (350 plants m(2)-full dose vs. 116 plants m(2)-1/3 dose). The results revealed that intercropping increased grain yield compared to monocropping: significantly (p < 0.0001) against both monocrops in 2021 and non-significantly against durum wheat in 2019 and 2020. Yield advantage in both intercropping systems ranged between 164 and 648%. Durum wheat competitiveness was stronger in 2019 and 2021, while lentil was the most competitive component in 2020. Intercropping favored P accumulation in durum wheat shoots. There was no difference in grain yield of both crops between the highly- and lowly-dense system in 2020 and 2021. Both intercropping strategies were as effective as mechanical hoeing in controlling weeds and proved beneficial in stabilizing lentil productivity. Further economic analysis capturing the additional costs incurred in intercropping and mechanical weeding would highlight the magnitude of profitability of these systems.

Intercropping red clover with intermediate wheatgrass suppresses weeds without reducing grain yield	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							"PERENNIAL GRAIN; CROP YIELD; ROOT-ROT; NITROGEN; SOIL; BIOMASS; SYSTEMS; FORAGE; FOOD; RESILIENCE"	Intermediate wheatgrass (IWG) [Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & Dewey] is the first commercially produced perennial grain crop in the United States. Intercropping legumes with IWG has the potential to enhance dual-purpose grain and forage production and contribute to weed control in organic management systems. We compared IWG with annual winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in monoculture and intercropped with red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) in a 3-yr experiment in central New York. Grain yield of IWG was lower than wheat in all years, partly due to lower tiller fertility and seed size in IWG. Compared with grain yield of 1,212 kg ha(-1) in the first year, IWG grain yield was 83% (202 kg ha(-1)) and 64% lower (441 kg ha(-1)) in the second and third years, respectively. Intermediate wheatgrass straw production increased 40% from 5,541 to 7,785 kg ha(-1) over 3 yr while wheat straw yield declined from 5,167 to 3,533 kg ha(-1). Red clover did not affect grain or straw yield of either crop but reduced weed biomass and weed species richness. Weed communities in IWG plots were dominated by perennial grasses by the second year of production, whereas annual weeds were dominant in wheat throughout the experiment. Preventing establishment of perennial weeds that will persist in perennial grain cropping systems should be a management priority. High forage production observed when comparing IWG and wheat suggest opportunities for including IWG in integrated crop-livestock systems where IWG's higher forage yield and quality has higher utility.

This study aimed to evaluate different grass forage crops intercropped with corn and their influence on the soil biological activity and on the successor crop grain yield. The study was carried out in the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 harvests, with four replicates under a randomized block design. The treatments consisted of corn intercropped with four grass species: corn + Massai (Megathyrsus maximus), corn + Zuri (Megathyrsus maximum cv. Zuri), corn + Marandu (Urochloa brizantha) and corn + Ruziziensis (Urochloa ruziziensis) and corn in single cultivation. The treatments were stablished in the 2017/2018 harvest and were followed by the subsequent soybean cultivation in the 2018/2019 harvest. In both cropping seasons the evaluated soil microbiological attributes and plant variables were: carbon and nitrogen from the microbial biomass (C-SMB and N-SMB), soil basal respiration, metabolic quotient, dehydrogenase enzymes, fluorescein diacetate activity, corn and forages yields. In the 2018/2019 harvest, soybean grain yield and leaf nutrients were also evaluated. N-SMB and dehydrogenase concentrations were higher in the corn + Zuri intercrop than in corn + Ruziziensis treatment in the 2017/2018 harvest. Corn grain yield is not affected by the intercropping with forage grasses. Single corn resulted in biological indicators that suggest stressful soil conditions, which resulted in lower soybean yield in succession. Soybean grown in succession to corn intercropped with forage grasses, had its average yield increased by 33%, compared to soybean grown in succession to single corn. The corn intercropped with tropical forages is an important tool for the sustainable increase of yield in the integrated production systems in the Maranhao Eastern Cerrado.

The objective of this work was to analyze the decomposition of straw remaining from autumn/winter crops in the development of soybean in succession in the Midwest region of Parana. The experiment was conducted between 2019 and 2021 in a completely randomized design, with eight treatments (spontaneous, black oat, brachiaria, corn, wheat, oilseed radish, corn + brachiaria, and black oat + oilseed radish) and four replications. After autumn/winter cultivation, biomass samples were dried and placed in nylon bags, returning to the original plot during soybean sowing. The decomposition bags were collected in seven periods over 120 days, coinciding with the soybean cycle. The decomposition rate was analyzed by regression. The regression equations and the amount of biomass remaining from the autumn/winter seasons were determinate the half-file and the remaining mass on the soil surface at sowing and at 30, 60, 90, and 120 days after sowing. Biomass production and decomposition rate varied with the season, depending on environmental conditions. Wheat had the lowest decomposition rate with a half-life greater than 100 days. Intercropping crops reduce the decomposition rate.

Here, a 2-years field experiment was performed to evaluate the effects of water deficit stress and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) application (as bio-fertilizer) on nutrients concentration, dry matter yield, essential oil quantity and quality of thyme in intercropping with soybean. Three irrigation levels, including (i) irrigation after depletion of 20% (I-20) as non-stressed, 50% (I-50) as moderate water deficit and 80% (I-80) available water as severe water deficit were applied as the main factor. The sub-factor was represented by different cropping patterns including thyme sole culture, replacement intercrop ratio of 50:50 and 66:34 (soybean: thyme) and the third factor was non-usage (control) and usage of AMF. According to our results, the thyme dry yield under moderate and severe water deficit stress decreased by 35 and 44% in the first year, and by 27 and 40% in the second year compared with non-stressed (I-20) plants, respectively. Also, the macro- and micro-nutrients of thyme leaves increased significantly in intercropping patterns after application of AMF. The maximum essential oil percentage of thyme was achieved in 50:50 intercropping ratio treated with AMF. Under moderate and severe water deficits, the major constituents of thyme essential oil including thymol, p-cymene and gamma -terpinene were increased in intercropping patterns treated with AMF. Generally, AMF application in intercropping ratio of 50:50 may be proposed to farmers as an eco-friendly approach to achieve desirable essential oil quality and quantity in thyme under water deficit stress conditions.

The present study aims to assess the intercropping arable system's services under contrasting field management and climate conditions. Simultaneously, this assessment focuses on the most agronomic and ecological indices widely used in the literature. Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum durum L.cv. VITRON) and chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.cv. FLIP 90/13 C) were cultivated, both in sole crop and intercrop during the 2018/2019 growing season. A field experiment was carried out under controlled conditions at three contrasting pedoclimatic sites and under three levels of N fertilization. Both grain and N yield of mixture crop were significantly higher (+11%) when chickpea and durum wheat were grown together under either low or moderate N application. Soil N availability as compared to the critical level increased by more than 19% from flowering to harvest stage for intercropped wheat under low N application (N-30 and N-60), while it decreased significantly for intercropped chickpea. In rich N soils and under low rainfall conditions (site 1 and 3), intercropping was generally more advantageous for yield (+14%), N yield (+23%), and land use (103 and 119.5% for grain and N yield, respectively) only with reduced N fertilization as assessed using both land equivalent ratio (LER) and land-use efficiency (LUE). Competition dominance was directly affected by changes in climatic conditions over sites; intercropped wheat was more competitive than their respective chickpea under low rainfall conditions. These findings illustrate the crucial role of competitive index assessment in intercropping to promise a robust method for crop N and yield diagnosis during fertilization decision-making."

We investigated the effectiveness of Glomus intraradices on yield, land equivalent ratio (LER), yield of essential oil (EO) and EO composition of coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) in different cropping systems. Two experiments were carried out in triplicate with a complete, randomized block design in the years 2017 and 2018. The cropping systems included a) coriander sole cropping at 25, 50 or 75 plants m? 2, b) soybean (Glycine max L.) sole cropping at 40 plants m? 2, and c) intercropping of different densities of coriander (25, 50 or 75 plants m-2) with soybean at 40 plants m? 2. All cropping systems were exposed to treatments without (-AM) or with (+AM) application of Glomus intraradices. Applying G. intraradices significantly increased contents of macroand micronutrients in coriander plants, and also enhanced LER and EO yield. Implementing intercropping and applying AM inoculation affected EO composition in coriander. The contents of limonene, apiole, coriander ether, n-dihydrocarvone, carvone, myristicin and coriander_apiole was enhanced in AM treated and intercropped coriander plants, while applying G. intraradices resulted in a reduced content of cis-sabinol and phytol of solecropped and intercropped coriander plants.

This study evaluated the agronomic viability of intercropping snow pea (Pisum sativum L., 'Ho Lan Dou') with cherry tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L. var. cerasiforme 'Sarina hybrid') without additional inputs of water and fertilizers on peas in an organic high tunnel production system under Southern Ontario climate conditions in Guelph, Ontario, Canada (lat. 43.5 degrees N, long. 80.2 degrees W) during 2015 and 2016. In each 80-cm-wide bed, the tomato crops were planted alternately in double rows spaced 30 cm apart, with in-row spacing of 110 cm, which resulted in a planting density of approximate to 24,000 plants/ha. The snow pea seeds were sown between the tomato plants (i.e., within the same beds as tomatoes) in holes (two seeds per hole), with four rows in each bed and in-row holes spaced 10 cm and at least 25 cm away from the tomato plants, which resulted in a seeding rate of approximate to 650, 000 seeds/ha. The same amount of water or fertilizer was applied to the intercropping and nonintercropping plots based on the needs of the cherry tomato plants. Plant growth, fruit yield, and quality were compared between tomato plants with and without intercropping. Intercropping with snow peas did not affect total marketable fruit yield, unmarketable fruit percentage, fruit quality traits (e.g., individual fruit weight, soluble solids content, dry matter content, and postharvest water loss), or early-stage plant growth of the cherry tomato. Therefore, it is at least an agronomical possibility to intercrop snow peas with cherry tomatoes on the same beds without additional inputs of water and fertilizer on snow peas in an organic high tunnel system. The additional yield of pea shoots or pods in the intercropping treatment also increased economic gross returns in the high tunnels, although the economic net return might vary with the costs of seeds and labor involved in snow pea growing.

Forage was harvested and placed inside micro-silos, which were opened after 100 days and samples were collected for chemical composition and in vitro gas production analyses. Intercropped silage had higher crude protein, acid detergent fiber, and lignin content than corn silage. Moreover, intercropped silage decreased total gas and methane production. Therefore, intercropped silage showed potential to increase conserved feed nutritional quality and reduce methane emissions in livestock production systems.

R. Br.] yields in Senegal are constrained by rainfall variability, persistent drought, and low soil fertility. Mungbean [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek], a short-duration and relatively drought-tolerant legume crop, is capable of improving soil fertility and productivity of associated crops. Our study evaluated the effects of pearl millet and mungbean intercropping on crop yields in the semi-arid regions of Senegal. Field experiments were conducted during the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons at Bambey and Nioro sites located within Senegal's west-central and Saloum agricultural regions, respectively. Experimental treatments: monocropped millet (T-1), monocropped mungbean (T-2, 100%), and 23% (T-3), 43% (T-4), 47% (T-5), 62% (T-6), 125% (T-7), and 164% (T-8) of mungbean intercropped with millet were laid out in a randomized complete block design and replicated four times. In addition to yield, canopy cover and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were measured and yield advantage was assessed with the land equivalent ratio (LER). Combined millet and mungbean seed yields were up to 60 and 85% higher under intercropping systems compared to millet monocropping at Bambey and Nioro, respectively. Similarly, LER was always greater than unity (> 1) under millet-mungbean intercropping compared to millet monocropping. Mean canopy cover estimates and NDVI values increased by up to 60 and 30% in millet-mungbean intercropping over millet grown alone, respectively. These combined yield gains obtained without fertilizer applications suggested that optimizing mungbean density (62-125%) in pearl millet-based systems can increase the combined yields in a low-input and/or high-risk environment in Senegal.

In light of the potential ecological consequences of pollen-mediated gene flow (PGF) from GM plants, a two year field trial was conducted to test the effects on PGF of sunflower, Helianthus annuus, buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum, and soybean, Glycine max, as intercrops in non-GM cotton fields during 2017 and 2018. DNA tests for hybridized seed were used to estimate rates of PGF in intercrop treatments. PGF was the lowest in cotton intercropped with either buckwheat or sunflower, likely due to the trapping of pollen in these flowers, and/or the diversion of pollinators away from cotton flowers. PGF declined as an exponential function of distance from the GM cotton; Y = Inx was the model of best fit for estimating pollen dispersal potential. A sunflower intercrop reduced the peak abundance of Aphis gossypii, (Hemiptera: Aphididae), Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), and Nysius ericae (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae) on cotton plants, although densities of Tetranychus cinnabarinus (Atari: Tetranychidae), were increased. A buckwheat intercrop had very similar effects on these pests, likely due to attraction of their natural enemies. We conclude that sunflower and buckwheat are suitable intercrops for reducing PGF from GM cotton, and may be useful for reducing PGF from other insect-pollinated GM crops in the agricultural landscape, while simultaneously contributing to control of specific pests. This is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, that intercrops can be used to reduce PGF from transgenic plants. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Moench) intercropped with Urochloa brizantha, Megathyrsus maximum and/or pigeon pea in a non-irrigated area of a low-altitude region of the Cerrado. A randomised block design was used, of plots split over time with six treatments and four replications over two agricultural years. The treatments were (I) monocropped forage sorghum, and forage sorghum intercropped with (II) U. brizantha, (III) M. maximum, (IV) U. brizantha and pigeon pea, (V) M. maximum and pigeon pea, and (VI) pigeon pea. The following were evaluated in the sorghum and its respective intercrops: plant height, stem diameter, stand and productivity. Intercropping sorghum with M. maximum reduced fresh and dry matter production in the sorghum, albeit with no significant effect on total dry matter production for the intercrop. Sorghum intercropped with M. maximum gave a higher percentage of panicles than the other intercropped systems.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of the intercropping of wheat in controlling cucumber Fusarium wilt disease. Bacterial community diversity and abundance in cucumber rhizosphere were estimated by high-throughput amplicon sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results showed that the intercropping of wheat inhibited the severity of cucumber seedling Fusarium wilt disease, increased the alpha diversity and altered the composition of the bacterial community in cucumber rhizosphere. Compared with monocropped cucumber, intercropped cucumber had higher relative abundances of Anaerolineae, Deltaproteobacteria, Phycisphaerae and Planctomycetacia, and lower Alphaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteria. Moreover, the intercropping of wheat promoted bacterial genera with plant-beneficial potential (e.g. Pseudomonas, Haliangium and Archangium spp.) in cucumber rhizosphere. Quantitative PCR confirmed that Pseudomonas spp. abundance was higher in intercropped cucumber rhizosphere than in monocropped cucumber rhizosphere. Overall, the intercropping of wheat decreased the severity of Fusarium wilt of cucumber and promoted potential plant-beneficial microbes in cucumber rhizosphere.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							"ECONOMIC-BENEFITS; YIELD; GROWTH"	"Different cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum) planting patterns are widely applied in the Yellow River Valley of China, and crop yield mainly depends on light interception. However, little information is available on how cotton canopy light capturing and yield distribution are affected by planting patterns. Hence, field experiments were conducted in 2016 and 2017 to study the response of cotton canopy light interception, square and boll distribution, the leaf area index (LAI) and biomass accumulation to three planting patterns: a cotton monoculture (CM, planted on 15 May) system, a cotton/wheat relay intercropping (CWI, planted on 15 May) system, in which three rows of wheat rows were intercropped with one row of cotton, and a system in which cotton was directly seeded after wheat (CWD, planted on 15 June). The following results were obtained: 1) greater light capture capacity was observed for cotton plants in the CM and CWI compared with the CWD, and the light interception of the CM was 22.4% and 51.4% greater than that of the CWI and CWD, respectively, at 30 days after sowing (DAS) in 2016; 2) more bolls occurred at the first sympodial position (SP) than at other SPs for plants in the CM; 3) based on the LAI and biomass accumulation, the cotton growth rate was the greatest in CWD, followed by CM and CWI; and 4) the CM produced significantly greater yields than did the other two treatments because it yielded more bolls and greater boll weight. Information on the characteristics of cotton growth and development in response to different planting patterns would be helpful for understanding the response of cotton yields to planting patterns and would facilitate the improvement of cotton productivity."

In this experiment, three different functional groups, soybean (Glycine max) as a C-3 and fixing nitrogen plant, corn (Zea mays) as a C-4 and nitrogen-demanding crop and marshmallow (Althaea officinalis) as a perennial medicinal plant, were cultivated as double and triple intercropping. The purpose of this study was to evaluate different patterns of intercropping in terms of production enhancement, weeds control, increase of nutrients uptake and improvement of soil biological properties as different ecosystem services and compare them with the sole cropping systems. For this purpose, two experiments were conducted based on strip design as a randomized complete block with three replications at research farm of Ferdowsi University of Mashhad in 2014 and 2015. Experimental treatments (14 treatments) were weeding and non-weeding, different planting patterns as double intercropping (corn+soybean, corn+marshmallow and soybean+marshmallow), triple intercropping (corn+soybean+marshmallow) and also their sole cropping. The results indicated that the highest density of weeds was observed by sole cropping of soybean among the different planting patterns in both years (46.7 plants per m(2) in the first year and 47.3 plants per m(2) in the second year) and the minimum number of weeds was observed under intercropping of corn+soybean+marshmallow with 37.6 plants per m(2) for the first year and sole cropping of Marshmallow by 13 plants per m(2) for the second year. Planting pattern treatment had no significant effect on Shannon-Weaver diversity index; however, the findings of the study illustrated that increasing plant diversity as intercropping caused to increase in weeds diversity. Among different intercropping patterns, the highest amount of nitrogen uptake was achieved from corn+soybean intercropping. In both weeding and non-weeding, phosphorous uptake in corn monoculture was higher than soybean and marshmallow monoculture, so that in the weed absence, phosphorus absorption in corn, soybean and marshmallow monocultures were 85.50, 46.66 and 44.51kgha(-1) respectively. Using the intercropping systems increased the soil microbial respiration and biomass in comparison with sole cropping systems. According to the findings of this study, it can be mentioned that intercropping systems not only increase economic yield but also improve other ecosystem services."

Description of the subject. Increasing plant diversity with flowering plants and releasing semiochemicals did not attract and support natural enemies of insect pests for biological control. Objectives. We tested the effect of intercropping oilseed rape with wheat, and releasing the sex pheromone of the ladybeetle Harmonia axyridis, on the abundance of aphids' natural enemies. Method. Four treatments repeated three times were compared in an experimental field in Langfang (Hebei, China): (i) oilseed rape-wheat intercropping + sex pheromone release, (ii) oilseed rape-wheat intercropping solely, (iii) pure-stand wheat and (iv) pure-stand oilseed rape. Ladybeetles, hoverflies, lacewings and parasitoids were pan-trapped during nine weeks in spring 2016 in each treatment. Results. A diversity of natural enemy species was trapped. However, intercropping and the release of the sex pheromone did not significantly increase their abundance compared to pure-stands. Conclusions. The results are discussed in regard to technical issues to improve the experimental protocol for future research in China.

In order to evaluate the quantity and quality of black cumin products under contrasting fertilization, a factorial experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design with three replications in 2016. Soybean and black cumin seeds were sown in five planting patterns (sole black cumin, sole soybean and three intercropping ratios of soybean: black cumin (1:2): one row of soybean plus two rows of black cumin, soybean: black cumin (1:1): one row of soybean plus one row of black cumin and soybean: black cumin (2:1): two rows of soybean plus one row of black cumin. All these cropping systems were received organic manure and chemical fertilizer. The results indicated that the highest seed yield (on an average by 86 g m(-2)) of black cumin was achieved in sole crop of black cumin treated with organic manure. The maximum seed yield of soybean (on an average by 247 g m(-2)) and land equivalent ratio (1.06) was obtained in two rows of soybean + one row of black cumin under the application of chemical fertilizer. The p-cymene (20.51-62.77%), carvacrol (2.40-25.99%), longifolene (1.11-24.69%) and spathulenol (0.9-14.45%) were major chemical compositions of black cumin. The highest content of p-cymene and carvacrol of black cumin essential oil were recorded in one row of soybean + two rows of black cumin with the application of chemical fertilizer and one row of soybean + one row of black cumin under chemical fertilizer, respectively. The highest longifolene and spathulenol content was observed in one row of soybean + two rows of black cumin treated with organic manure. These major chemical compositions are useful for industrial use (food and pharmaceutical). Therefore, according to different subjects of applying in industries it could be suggested especial treatment with favorite major compounds.

The results showed that optimal yield of dill and the highest land equivalent ratio (LER) and antioxidant activity (2.43 mu g ml(-1)) of dill were achieved in pattern of two rows of soybean + one row of dill treated with organic manure. Carvone (22.06-49.66%), a-phellandrene (10.79- 34.49%), p-cymene (21.66-33.69%) and dillapiole (135-12.14%) were major chemical components of dill. The dill-soybean intercropping and application of organic manure enhanced the content of alpha-phellandrene and p-cymene as well. These major chemical compositions are useful for industrial use (food and pharmaceutical). So, according to different subjects of applying in industries it could be suggested especial treatment with favorite major compounds. In general, soybean-dill intercropping and the application of organic manure enhanced the productivity of dill and improved essential oil quality and antioxidant activity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The study was conducted during three crop seasons (2011/2012, 2012/2013, and 2013/2014), with the following cover crops: white oat (Avena sativa), black oat (Avena strigosa), ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum), vetch (Vicia sativa), forage radish (Raphanus sativus), the intercrop black oat + forage radish, and wheat (Triticum aestivum) as the standard management. Forage radish and the intercrop black oat + forage radish provided greater soil cover rates after 30 days of planting, as well as dry matter production in the three crop seasons. After 45 and 90 days from desiccation, however, white oat and ryegrass showed the highest soil cover rate. Black oat and the intercrop black oat + forage radish provided higher soybean yield than the standard management with wheat, in the 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 crop seasons. Winter cover crops can significantly affect soybean yield in succession, and black oat and the intercrop black oat + forage radish stand out for this purpose.

J	"Viguier, L; Bedoussac, L; Journet, EP; Justes, E"				"Viguier, Loic; Bedoussac, Laurent; Journet, Etienne-Pascal; Justes, Eric"			Yield gap analysis extended to marketable grain reveals the profitability of organic lentil-spring wheat intercrops	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						"Lodging; Bruchid; Harvest efficiency; Gross margin"	"POPULATION; COLEOPTERA; DIVERSITY; FEED; FOOD"	Lentil has been overlooked by organic farmers in Europe mainly because of low and unstable yields, notably due to lodging and bruchid beetles. Our study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of lentil-spring wheat intercrops to lower these reducing factors and increase yield and gross margin. A 2-year field experiment was carried out in southwestern France in 2015 and 2016 under organic farming rules. Four lentil and two wheat cultivars were grown as sole crops and intercrops. The yield gap concept was adapted to include grain losses due to mechanical harvest and insufficient quality. Mean total intercrop grain yield before mechanical harvest was higher than mean sole crop (1.91 +/- 0.47 vs. 1.57 +/- 0.29 t ha(-1), respectively), with a lower mean yield of lentil in intercrop than in sole crop (1.06 +/- 0.28 vs. 1.61 +/- 0.54 t ha(-1)). This led to a lower mean gross margin of intercrop than that of sole cropped lentil (1772 +/- 507 vs. 2371 +/- 756 a,notsign ha(-1)), before mechanical harvest. The percentage of bruchid-damaged grain did not differ significantly between intercrop and sole crop (41%). However, lentil lodging was lower in intercrop than in sole crop (15 vs. 40%), which strongly increased lentil mechanical harvest efficiency (75 vs. 50%). This led to a similar mechanically harvested yield of lentil in intercrop and sole crop (0.80 t ha(-1)). Consequently, mean marketable gross margin of intercrops was higher than that of sole cropped lentil (949 +/- 404 vs. 688 +/- 393 a,notsign ha(-1)), due to the addition of marketable wheat yield. We thus demonstrated for the first time the interest of extending the yield gap concept to consider all grain losses that influence profitability, including those linked to mechanical harvest efficiency and insufficient grain quality. Furthermore, this is a first demonstration of the higher profitability of organic lentil-wheat intercrops compared to sole crops despite the additional costs associated with grain sorting.

Major aphid species that infest wheat in China include Sitobion avenae, Rhopalosiphum padi, Schizaphis graminum and Metopolophium dirhodum. However, during our wheat field survey in Wenshang County of Shangdong Province, China, we observed that Aphis gossypii can feed on wheat. The damage risk of A. gossypii on wheat was assessed using host shift method. A population of A. gossypii collected from a wheat field in 2015 and another population reared on cotton under laboratory conditions for a decade without exposure to insecticides were used in the study. The results of host shift demonstrated that the A. gossypii colony from wheat has not yet developed wheat specialization. Moreover, the assessment of A. gossypii fitness on wheat and cotton showed that fecundity and net reproductive rate of A. gossypii population fed on wheat was significantly higher comparing to the population fed on cotton, whether the initial host of A. gossypii population was wheat or cotton. This study raises a warning that the cotton aphid has potential to establish well on wheat and it may cause significant effects under specific circumstances. Therefore, future studies are required to evaluate the effects of A. gossypii on wheat production.	"[Fan Yin-jun; Li Fen; Mohammed, Abd Allah A.

R. Br"	"DIFFERENT CUTTING AGES; FERMENTATION; DIGESTIBILITY; PERFORMANCE; GRASS; CORN; MEAL"	With the arrival of new early genotypes and high nutritive value and productive potential, millet has been gaining prominence in recent years for the production of silage, and it promises lower costs of production. Thus, the consortium of millet with tropical forages can increase the production of silage, providing more food to be used in the offseason, where there is low availability of forage. The objective of this study was to evaluate the dry mass production, fermentative characteristics and chemical-bromatological of pearl millet silage and Paiaguas palisadegrass in monocropping and intercropping in different forage systems in the second cropping season. The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks with four replicates. The treatments consisted of silage of the following forage systems: monocropped pearl millet, monocropped Paiaguas palisadegrass, pearl millet intercropped in rows with Paiaguas palisadegrass, pearl millet intercropped inter-row with Paiaguas palisadegrass, and pearl millet oversown and intercropped with Paiaguas palisadegrass (totaling 20 experimental plots). The consortium of pearl millet with Paiaguas palisadegrass contributed to raise the dry matter contents of the silages, except in the system using the overgrowth. Pearl millet silages monocropped and intercropped with Paiaguas palisadegrass presented reductions in pH and ammoniacal nitrogen values as well as favor lactic fermentation. Pearl millet monocropped and intercropped silage exhibited better fermentative and bromatological characteristics than silage obtained from monocropped Paiaguas palisadegrass. Therefore, creating silage from intercropped forages provides an interesting supplemental roughage option that can be used during the offseason for animal feeding.

Additionally, amino acid content and fatty acid composition of lentil seeds were determined. Lentil was sown at a row spacing of 20 and 25 cm. In var. 'Tina' seeds, a higher content of K, Ca, Mg, Mn and B was determined than in var. 'Anita'. 'Anita' seeds, in turn, were characterized by a higher content of fat, N, P, Cu, Zn and Fe. Lentil seeds sown at a spacing of 20 cm had a higher content of P, K, Ca, Cu, Zn and B compared to a spacing of 25 cm, but they contained less nitrogen. The presence of oats as a supporting crop deteriorated the quality of lentil seeds by contributing to a reduced content of N, P, K, Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe and B compared to sole cropped lentil. A higher content of C18:0, C18:2, C18:3, C20:0, OMEGA 3, and OMEGA 6 acids was determined in 'Anita' seeds. Var. 'Tina', in turn, contained more C16:0, C18:1 acids.

A randomized complete block design was carried out with four replicates, in a 5x2+2 factorial arrangement, as follows: five forage species - Urochloa brizantha 'Marandu', Urochloa ruziziensis, Panicum maximum 'Mombaca', Panicum maximum 'Massai', and Pennisetum americanum -, intercropped with soybean over two crop years (2013/2014 and 2014/2015), plus two controls, with P. americanum sowed in succession to soybean or with soybean monocropping followed by winter fallow (traditional cultivation). Soybean yield components and forage straw yield were evaluated. None of the intercropping systems reduced soybean grain yield, compared with monocropped soybean. The oversown species can significantly improve soybean productivity, as is the case for soybean intercropped with P. maximum 'Mombaca', compared with soybean monocropping, followed or not by millet. Panicum maximum 'Mombaca' is the most effective forage species for dry matter accumulation in the fall/spring period.

R. Br.] cropping systems including intercropping with cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp]. The research objectives were to determine pearl millet sole crop (PMSC) and intercrop nutrient response functions, profit opportunities from fertilizer use, and a means of relating intercrop to PMSC response. Pearl millet-cowpea trials were conducted in Niger and Mali. The treatment structure was an incomplete factorial with five, four, and four levels of P, N, and K, respectively. Response functions were determined for intercropping with cowpea yield converted to a pearl millet grain yield equivalent for ratios of cowpea to pearl millet grain value (CpPm) ranging from 1 to 5 kg kg(-1). Response functions were also determined in consideration of fodder value. A method of adjusting PMSC response coefficients with CpPm as the independent variable was developed for determination of intercrop response functions. Yields and responses to nutrients were low but adequate for profitable N and P use. Value of intercrop production ranged from 50 to 125% more compared with PMSC for CpPm of 2 and 4, and the respective response to 10 kg ha(-1) P was 28 and 135% more with intercrop. Consideration of fodder added 23% to the yield value. Application of N and P for intercrop compared with PMSC production has much more profit potential. The ability to apply PMSC functions in determination of pearl millet-cowpea responses to applied nutrients offers a means to improve fertilizer use for the intercrop.

We evaluated the productivity and morphological characteristics of buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) intercropped with butterfly pea (Clitoria ternatea) under shade conditions using an irrigated area with an artificial shading system (26, 39, 55%, or full sunlight). Butterfly pea was implemented in half of the land parcels in a randomized block using a split plot design with three replications. One hundred twenty days after planting was designated as the uniformity cut and the cutting was performed every 45 days for four consecutive cycles. The morphological analysis was performed during the first and fourth cycle, and the herbage mass was determined. The shadow had a quadratic effect on the leaf appearance rate in the first cycle, while shading had a quadratic deviation effect on the leaf elongation rate in the second cycle and an increased linear effect on the length of the sheet in the first cycle. Shading had a quadratic effect on the herbage mass in the third cycle and decreased linearity in the fourth cycle. The highest percentage of buffel grass was found in the single system in the first and second cycles. In addition, we observed a decreased linear effect of shade in the first cycle and the quadratic deviation effect of shade in the second cycle. A quadratic effect of shade was observed in the third and fourth cycles. The survival of the butterfly pea had a quadratic effect with a minimum rate level of 21% shading. The crude protein content showed a system effect in four cycles with higher crude protein in the intercropping system in the first and second cycles. There was also a quadratic effect of shade in the third cycle and linear increase in the fourth cycle. In conclusion, shading increased the leaf appearance rates and elongation at intermediate levels. In addition, a high level of shading increased the leaf length and survival of butterfly pea while it decreased the mass of the forage produced.

A randomized complete block design was used, with seven replicates, in the 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 crop seasons. In the intercropped system, the forages were sown 21 and 14 days after soybean emergence, in the first and second crop seasons, respectively. Grain yield did not differ for soybean in sole crop or intercropped, except for soybean + U. ruziziensis and soybean + 'BRS Paiaguas', which were less productive in the second year of evaluation. The 'BRS Tamani' forage was the most suited for intercropping with soybean, considering its morphological characteristics and its low competition potential. Soybean intercropped with perennial forages contributes to suppress weed growth and, overall, does not compromise soybean yield."

Photosynthetic efficiency, gas exchange and yield of castor bean intercropped with peanut in semiarid Brazil	REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL			English	Article						"chlorophyll fluorescence; photosynthesis; Ricinus communis L.; yield"	PHOTOCHEMICAL EFFICIENCY	To evaluate the photosynthetic efficiency, gas exchange and yield of castor bean intercropped with peanut under Brazilian semiarid conditions, a field experiment was set up with six treatments and four replicates arranged in a randomized block design. The experiment consisted of the cultivation of castor bean 'BRS Energia' in a monocrop system and intercropped with peanut 'BR 1'. One treatment was formed by monocropped castor bean and the others by the castor bean intercropped with peanut with different intercrop establishment times, i.e. peanut sowing times (0, 10, 15, 20 and 25 days after castor bean sowing). The castor bean photosynthetic and carboxylation efficiencies were higher in the intercrop system with a 25-day interval between sowings. Peanut sowing at 0 to 10 days after castor bean sowing in the intercropped system affected the photochemical efficiency of the latter, which resulted in its yield reduction. Larger intervals between sowing of peanut 'BR-1' and of the main crop increased castor bean yield in the intercrop system.	"[Dutra, Wellison F.; Dutra, Alexson F.; Filgueiras, Luanna M.

To gain information about the possible use of lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) cover crop as an alternative and sustainable weed-control strategy for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), an experiment was performed at Thiverval-Grignon, France, from 2008 to 2010. We compared conventional and reduced tillage as well as the presence and absence of living mulch (i.e. lucerne) on weeds and wheat production. Percentage soil coverage and aboveground biomass of wheat, lucerne and weeds were measured at the end of grain filling. Weed communities were analysed in terms of composition and diversity. During both seasons, wheat biomass did not significantly decrease in reduced-till trials compared with conventional ones (7.0 and 7.2tha(-1), respectively, in 2008-09; 6.9 and 7.1tha(-1) in 2009-10). Regardless of soil management, the percentage soil coverage by wheat significantly decreased when it was intercropped, although wheat biomass was not significantly reduced compared with the sole crop. To minimise cash-crop losses, we studied the competition between wheat, lucerne and weeds, testing various herbicide strategies. Early control of lucerne allowed better balance between weed control and wheat development. In addition, weed communities varied among treatments in terms of abundance and composition, being reduced but more varied in plots associated with lucerne. A functional group analysis showed that grasses benefited from reduced-till conditions, whereas problematic weeds such as annuals with creeping and climbing morphologies were substantially reduced. In addition, annual and perennial broad-leaf species with rosette morphology were also significantly decreased when lucerne was used as living mulch. Wheat production in reduced-till conditions intercropped with lucerne living mulch may be useful for integrated weed management, reducing the need for herbicides."

This study was conducted to compare the effects on morphological traits, dry-matter (DM) yield, legume ratio (LR), crude protein content (CP), crude protein yield (CP yield) and mineral concentrations (N, P, K, S, Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Na, B and Zn) of Hungarian vetch (Vicia pannonica Crantz.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) grown in intercropping mixtures in response to three rates of organic solid cattle manure application (M-0: 0, M-1: 10, M-2: 20tha(-1)). Experimentation was conducted on soils of two different soil depths [shallow (8-12cm; low-medium erosion risk) and normal soil depth (18-22cm; no erosion risk)] on a sloping field in the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 growing seasons at Gumushane, Turkey. Herbage harvested on the shallow depth area had 22-73% less DM yield, 14-72% less CP yield, 6-9% greater CP content and generally higher minerals contents than herbage from the normal soil depth area. Cattle manure applications increased DM yield by about 23%, increased CP content and CP yield, and also increased the contents of most minerals in herbage of the intercropping mixtures, relative to the control, averaged over the two soil depths. It is suggested that, for areas with shallow soil depths that are prone to erosion, plant cover should be used for forage production, and that fertilization with solid cattle manure at 20tha(-1) can support production of quality forage of acceptable DM yield."

Finishing steers on oat pasture intercropped with legumes or receiving energetic supplementation	ARQUIVO BRASILEIRO DE MEDICINA VETERINARIA E ZOOTECNIA			Portuguese	Article						"Avena sativa L.; stoking rate; the forage mass; vetch"	"RYEGRASS LOLIUM-MULTIFLORUM; PERFORMANCE; MIXTURE"	"The aim of this experiment was to evaluate the association of vetch (Vica sativa) or energy supplementation in oat (Avena sativa) on the performance of steers in the finishing phase. The experiment was performed in 18 steers, quarter Marchegiana, quarter Aberdeen Angus and 2/4 Nellore genetic groups, with the live weight and age of 360kg and 19 months, respectively, divided into three treatments: pasture white oat, pasture white oat intercropped with vetch and oat pasture with energetic supplementation with the basis of ground corn (1% body weight per day in dry matter). The experimental design was a randomized block design with three treatments and three replications. The interaction was observed by the period of evaluation and treatments for the participation of oat leaf in grassland. The participation of vetches increased in the course of the experiment from 3.51% to 12.21% as opposed to the participation of oat, which decreased in the course of the experiment in all treatments. No significant difference (P>0.05) was found for the forage mass, stoking rate, forage offer and rate of daily accumulation between treatments. The animals that received supplementation showed higher (P<0.05) average daily weight gain (1.08kg/day), live weight gain for ha (4.47kg/ha/day) and total live weight gain (242.82kg) compared with those animals that received only oat (0.68kg, 2.50kg/ha/day; 123.49kg, respectively). While the animals that have remained in pasture with oat and vetch showed intermediate results (0.89kg/day, 2.99kg/ha/day and 154.26kg, respectively) the final weight was better in the treatment with supplementation (424.44kg).

The results showed that eu-dominant families were Rhabditidae, Cephalobidae and Aphelenchidae among 15 families and 19 genera. Nematode abundance in wheat rhizosphere soil was smaller in wheat/jujube intercropping system, mainly because of lower numbers of bacterial feeders and fungal feeders. Besides, the nematode numbers of cp-1 and cp-2 (cp, colonizer-persister) guilds were significantly lower in wheat/jujube intercropping system than that in monoculture wheat system, due to the markedly lower numbers of Rhabditidae and Cephalobidae, although those of cp-3 and cp-4 guilds had no significant differences between monoculture and intercropping systems. Shannon-Weaver index (H'), genus dominance index (Ig) and structural index (SI), represented soil food web diversity and structure, had no differences between monoculture and intercropping systems. Significantly lower values of Wasilewska index (WI) and PPI/MI in monoculture wheat than in intercropping system. It was concluded that the soil status in monoculture wheat system exhibited better soil ecosystem in compared with wheat/jujube intercropping system.	"[Liu, Y. B.; Zhang, L. L.; Liu, Q.

However, soil properties usually have some spatial dependence. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of winter cover crops on physical properties of soil and soybean yields using thematic maps. Five winter treatments were used: black oats; intercropping 1 (forage turnips and black oats); intercropping 2 (forage turnips, black oats and common vetch); wheat; and control. Macroporosity, microporosity, total porosity, bulk density and water content of the soil from 0 - 0.1 m depths were evaluated after the winter cover crop management. Soybeans were sown over the entire area in the summer after the winter cover crop management, and the soybean yield was determined for each treatment. Maps for each treatment were created and compared to the control treatment using the relative deviation coefficient (RDC). The cover crops improved the total macroporosity of the soil in some regions of the study area. The black oats were more efficient at maintaining higher water content of the soil, and it can be used to decrease the bulk density."

In intercropping systems, short crops often grow under vegetative shade of tall crops. Soybean, one important legume, is often planted in intercropping. However, little is known about the mechanisms of shade inhibition effect on leaf size in soybean leaves at the transcriptome level. We analyzed the transcriptome of shaded soybean leaves via RNA-Seq technology. We found that transcription 1085 genes in mature leaves and 1847 genes in young leaves were significantly affected by shade. Gene ontology analyses showed that expression of genes enriched in polysaccharide metabolism was down-regulated, but genes enriched in auxin stimulus were up-regulated in mature leaves; and genes enriched in cell cycling, DNA-replication were down-regulated in young leaves. These results suggest that the inhibition of higher auxin content and shortage of sugar supply on cell division and cell expansion contribute to smaller and thinner leaf morphology, which highlights potential research targets such as auxin and sugar regulation on leaves for crop adaptation to shade in intercropping."

Common, regarding to vegetative growth and corn yield, capacity of production of forage dry matter, the infestation of weeds and the effect of this system of production in the soybean crop in rotation. Two forms of sowing (hand-sowing and on-line sowing) of U. ruziziensis, four amounts of seeds (200, 400, 600 e 800 points of cultural value, PCV = quantities of seeds x cultural value) and one treatment additional with the single corn were studied. The intercropping did not affect negatively the vegetative growth and corn yield when compared to the single corn. The sowing of 200 PCV of U. ruziziensis seeds, hand-sowed and on-line sowed to 22 days after of sowing of the corn was enough for the maintenance of adequate amount of straw on the soil. At the moment of the harvest of the corn, the dry matter of weed reduced with the increase of the amount of U. ruziziensis seeds and was bigger when the forager was hand-sowed. In the soybean crop in rotation, the density and dry matter of weed reduced linearly with the increase of the amount of U. ruziziensis seeds used in the first year of the research. The intercropping of corn and U. ruziziensis in the first year of the experiment benefited the plants population, plants height and yield of soybean when compared to the monoculture of corn in the same period.

'Comum') in corn on corn plant development, forage dry matter production, weed infestation and soybean plant development and yield. The kudzu seeds were either broadcasted over the terrain or sown in furrows (in the main plots) at rates, in both cases, of 400, 800, 1200 and 1600 points of cultural value (on the subplots). Singly cultivated corn was considered the control treatment. Intercropping did not cause corn plant development to show any significant difference compared with that of the singly cultivated corn plants. When sown in furrows, the number and dry matter contents of the kudzu plants were higher than sowing by broadcasting. The number of plants and the dry matter of the plants increased with the number of seeds. Prior to sowing soybean, the incidence of weeds decreased as the number of kudzu seeds at sowing increased. The intercropping of corn with kudzu benefited soybean plant population, plant height, and grain yield in comparison with the single cultivating of corn in the previous year.

However, to achieve success it is important to identify crop cultivars more adapted to intercropping with grasses. Therefore, the objective was to evaluate nutrient concentration and grain yield of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] cultivars with different life cycles as affected by palisadegrass [Brachiaria brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich) Stapf] intercropped in the same furrow at different depths, in a no-till system, as well as dry matter production and protein concentration of palisadegrass pasture. Experiments were performed during two growing seasons, on a Typic Haplorthox, at Botucatu, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The experimental design was a randomized block, arranged in a 2 x 4 factorial scheme, with six replications. Treatments consisted of two cropping systems (sole cropped soybean; soybean and palisadegrass intercropped) and four soybean cultivars (super-early cycle [Monsoy 6101], early cycle [Embrapa 48], normal cycle [BRS 133], and late cycle [Emgopa 313]). Life cycle duration of the soybean had a marked effect, and only early cycle soybean were successful intercrops. Intercropping palisadegrass with super-early or early soybean cultivars were viable options to crop-livestock integration, because they did not affect both soybean or palisadegrass yield. In addition, with these cultivars, it was possible to cultivate grain and then afterward more time for cattle (Bos taurus and Bos indicus) grazing in the same area, providing greater revenue compared to sole soybean cropped or in the intercropping with longer cycle cultivars."

J	"Zhang, J; Cao, XL; Yong, TW; Yang, WY"				"Zhang Jing; Cao Xiao-Lin; Yong Tai-Wen; Yang Wen-Yu"			Seed treatment with uniconazole powder induced drought tolerance of soybean in relation to changes in photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence	RESEARCH ON CROPS			English	Article						"Chlorophyll; relay strip intercropping; seed treatment; soybean; uniconazole powder; water deficit; yield components"	"LIPID-PEROXIDATION; ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; STRESS; YIELD; RAPE; ALLEVIATION; CULTIVARS; GROWTH; STEM"	Water deficit is an important constraint of global production of soybean. Dry seed treatment with uniconazole powder is a simple low-cost technology. To test whether such technology could be used to increase tolerance to water deficits in soybean, the effects of uniconazole application on photosynthesis, leaf relative water content, chlorophyll fluorescence and seed yield were studied. Uniconazole at 0, 2, 4 and 8 mg/kg seed was 'applied before sowing. Four levels of soil moisture (75% field capacity for well-watered control and 60, 45 and 30% for drought-stressed treatment) were applied at blooming stage. Drought stress depressed leaf relative water content, chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomata! conductance (Gs) and transpiration rate (Tr), while leaf relative water content, chlorophyll content, Pn, Gs and Tr of uniconazole-treated plants were higher than that of none uniconazole treated plants under the same soil moisture. Uniconazole treatment markedly increased maximum quantum yield of PS II (Fv/Fm) and photochemical quenching (qP) of drought-stressed plants. Treatment with uniconazole also significantly increased biomass accumulation, root/shoot ratio, the numbers of branch pod, branch seed and decreased empty pod of soybean when drought-stressed. This study shows that dry seed treatment with uniconazole can be used as a plant growth regulator technology to enhance drought tolerance and minimize the yield loss of soybean caused by water deficits.

MG-100 and Calopogonium muconoides, regarding to vegetative growth and corn yield, capacity of production of forage dry matter, infestation of weeds and the effect of this system of production in the soybean crop in rotation. This research was carried out under field conditions form December 2008 to April 2010 in the UNESP, Campus of Jaboticabal, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The experiment was arranged in a randomized block in split-plot design with four replications. Two forages species (A. pintoi and C. muconoides), four amounts of seeds (400, 800, 1200 e 1600 points of cultural value ha(-1)) and one treatment additional with single corn were studied. The intercropping did not affect the vegetative growth and corn yield when compared to the single corn. The C. muconoides had greater density and dry matter of plants than A. pintoi. The number of plants and dry matter of C. muconoides increased with increasing the amount of seeds sowed in the area. These variables were not affected by the sowing density of A. pintoi. The straw production by the forage species before of the soybean crop in rotation was inexpressive (less than 1100 kg ha(-1)). The intercropping did not affect the weed occurrence and the development of the soybean crop in rotation.

Three experiments were performed, as follows: Experiment 1 - Brachiaria grass intercropped with corn at different plant ages; Experiment 2 - Cultivation of brachiaria grass intercropped with corn set in different sowing arrangements; and Experiment 3 - Intercropping of brachiaria grass and soybean. Passage kinetic of particles was determined by the recovery of markers in feces. In order to obtain the ruminal degradation of DM and NDF, nylon bags were used at zero time, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 144 hours. The particles' passage kinetic of corn with brachiaria grass silage and brachiaria grass silage presented 3%/h and 2.3%/h, respectively; and for soybean and brachiaria grass silage, it was 1.8%/h, which can be explained in part by the mixture of materials ensiled. The materials originated from the intercropping caused rumen fill. Degradation rates were lower when compared with literature data. The brachiaria grass silage obtained from corn and/or soybean crop-pasture integrated system is a feed with low nutritive value due to its low NDF degradation rate and low passage rate, causing rumen fill and, thus, possibly resulting in low intake and poor animal performance."

This research was carried out under field conditions from December 2008 to April 2010 at the UNESP Campus of Jaboticabal, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design in split-plots, with four replications. Two forms of sowing (hand-sowing and on-line sowing) of coloniao grass and four amounts of seeds (200, 400, 600, and 800 points of cultural value - PCV) were studied, plus three additional treatments with the single species. Intercropping did not affect vegetative growth and corn yield, when compared to single corn. In the harvest of corn grains, there was more dry matter and plant density of coloniao grass when 800 PCV were sown. However, before soybean sowing, dry matter production did not differ between the intercropping treatments. Thus, the sowing of 200 PCV of coloniao seeds, hand-sowing and on-line sowing, was sufficient to maintain an adequate amount (9.1 ton ha(-1)) of mulch on the soil. Prior to soybean sowing, weed infestation in the single corn treatment was higher than during intercropping and the single forage treatment (hand sowing and on-line sowing). The same was observed after the installation of the crop for weed density. Corn and coloniao grass intercropping did not influence the characteristics evaluated in the soybean crop cultivated in rotation. No difference was observed between intercropping and corn in monoculture for soybean yield.	"[Correia, N.

It was evaluate, also, contents of CP, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), lignin (LIG), non-fibrous carbohydrates (NFC), NDT, butyric acid and lactic acid, ammonia nitrogen, the content of DM and pH of these silage cultures harvested in two phenological stages (R6 and R7) of the soybean plants. The production of DM was greater in signal grass in single culture, regardless of the vegetative stage. The DM content of signal grass silage in single culture was low in both vegetative stages (19.55 and 19.49%). In silages from signal grass and soybean intercropping and soybean in single culture, the content of DM was higher in the R7 vegetative stage. Regardless of the vegetative stage, soybean in single culture produced higher content of CP, NFC, LIG, TDN and higher amount of CP, followed by signal grass and soybean intercropping and signal grass in single culture, which showed inverse behavior for NDF content. The amount of TDN obtained in signal grass and soybean intercropping and soybean in single culture increased from the R6 to R7 vegetative stage, whereas in signal grass in single culture, decreased with advancing of the crop maturities. In all silages, harvested in the two vegetation stages, the values of pH and butyric acid were high and the values of lactic acid were low. In the R7 stage, ammonia nitrogen level of the silages was lower than the R6. It is feasible to use the signal grass and soybean intercropping for silage production, being recommended to harvesting the crops in R7 vegetative stage of the soybean plants.

Therefore, all experiment was conducted with the intention of evaluating phytomass production as well as micronutrient levels and accumulation in millet (Pennisetum typhoides (Burm.) Stapf), jack bean (Canavalia ensiformes (L.) DC.), and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan, dwarf cultivar), as sole crops and intercropping gramineous with leguminous crops, for straw production in a no-tillage system. The experiment was carried out in the experimental field at the Agriculture Department of the Federal University of Lavras (Lavras, Minas Gerais state, Brazil). The experimental was conducted using a randomized block design, with seven treatments for species nutrient levels Under different conditions (sole crops or intercropping) and five treatments for phyton-lass production and micronutrient accumulation, with four replications. For phytomass production, only the pigeon pea sole crop displayed lower yield of fresh and dry phytomass, while the Others produced oil average 12.361 and 2.854 t ha(-1) of fresh and dry phytomass yield, respectively. There were significant differences in B, Cu and Zn levels, and in accumulation of all evaluated micronutrients. The leguminous species presented the greatest B levels, with the greatest Cu and Zn levels found in millet. In general, millet plus jack bean intercropping presented the greatest micronutrient accumulation.

Temperature-mediated developmental delay may limit yield of cotton in relay intercrops with wheat	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"air temperature; soil temperature; soil cover; thermal time; physiological time; phenology"	"GROWTH; COMPONENTS; PHENOLOGY; SYSTEMS; MODEL; UNITS; L."	"In the Yellow River valley of China, more then 1.4 million ha of cotton are grown as relay intercrops with wheat. Cotton is sown in April when winter wheat is already in the reproductive phase; thus, a wheat crop with a fully developed canopy will compete for resources with cotton plants in the seedling stage. Yields of cotton are lower in relay intercropping systems than in a monocrop, but the aggregate yield of the cotton-wheat system is greater than of monocultures of the component crops. We study the hypothesis that the lower yield of intercropped cotton is a consequence of delayed development and fruit formation of the cotton as a result of a lowered temperature experienced by seedlings in the intercrop, compared to monoculture, due to shading by wheat. Field experiments were conducted in 3 subsequent years in Anyang, Henan, China. Wheat and cotton were grown as monocrops and as strip intercrops. Four intercrop layouts were investigated, differing in number of wheat and cotton rows in a strip: 3:1, 3:2, 4:2 and 6:2. Developmental stage of the cotton was recorded at regular intervals during the growing cycle while air and soil temperatures were measured with thermocouples at several soil depths and cross-row positions in the canopy. Temperatures at and near the soil surface were substantially (on average 3 degrees C) lower in intercrops than in monoculture, especially on sunny days, thus lowering the rate of temperature accumulation of cotton seedlings in intercrops, compared to those in monocultures. Cotton in intercrops showed a pronounced delay in early development, e.g. attainment of the squaring stage, compared to monocrops. The period from planting to first square, expressed in thermal time (TT), lasted 531 degrees C d in cotton monoculture and 638-670 degrees C d in intercrops. There were no significant differences in developmental delay between different intercropping patterns. The formation of fruits in intercrops lagged behind by 9-15 d, compared to monoculture, while the number of fruit nodes per plant, averaged over 3 years, was reduced from 30.3 in monocrops to 19.9 in intercrops. The later formation of fruits thus results in a reduction in fruit number and also in a reduction in average age of the fruits, limiting their growth and the sink capacity of the plant as a whole. A plastic film cover increased temperatures in a 3:2 intercrop at the soil surface by 1.9 degrees C and at 5 cm soil depth by 2.7 degrees C, thus restoring the thermal conditions to levels common in monoculture. A cover with straw, however, decreased the temperature at the soil surface by 2.9 degrees C and at 5 cm depth by 1.3 degrees C. We conclude that the thermal climate in wheat-cotton intercrops is suboptimal for the cotton seedlings. The resulting delay in development of cotton culminates in a lower reproductive capacity and sink capacity. In combination with a reduced source strength, due to later and reduced canopy development in intercropped cotton, these effects result in a lint yield that is substantially lower than in monoculture cotton. This constraint can be ameliorated by measures that improve light capture and heat loading by the cotton, e.g. planting a semi-dwarf wheat or cultivation of cotton on ridges, or application of a plastic film mulch in the cotton seed bed. Early maturing cotton cultivars are at an advantage in intercropping systems. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."	"[Zhang, L.; Van der Werf, W.; Spiertz, J. H.

Nitrogen economy in relay intercropping systems of wheat and cotton	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						"N content; internal N use efficiency (IE); crop N dynamics; relative N yield total (RNT)"	"NUTRIENT-UPTAKE; USE EFFICIENCY; LOWLAND RICE; RESOURCE USE; RESPONSES; CROPS; COMPETITION; TILLAGE; GROWTH; CHINA"	Relay intercropping of wheat and cotton is practiced on a large scale in China. Winter wheat is thereby grown as a food crop from November to June and cotton as a cash crop from April to October. The crops overlap in time, growing as an intercrop, from April till June. High levels of nitrogen are applied. In this study, we analyzed the N-economy of the monocultures of cotton and wheat, and of four relay intercropping systems, differing in number of rows per strip of cotton or wheat. Field experiments were carried out from 2001/02 to 2003/04 in the Yellow River region in China. We quantified the nitrogen uptake and nitrogen use efficiency of wheat and cotton in relay intercropping systems to test if intercrops are more resource use efficient in comparison to monocrops. Nitrogen (N) yields of wheat per unit area in the four intercropping systems were lower than in the monocrop, which ranged from 203 to 288 kg ha(-1). The total N-uptake per unit biomass was similar between wheat in mono- and intercrops. On average, the N-yield of cotton per unit area was lower in intercrops than in monocrops, which ranged from 110 to 127 kg ha(-1), but the total N-uptake per unit biomass was higher in intercropped cotton, as dry matter production was reduced to a greater extent by intercropping than N-uptake. The N-uptake of cotton was diminished during the intercropping phase, but recovered partially during later growth stages. The physiological nitrogen use efficiency (IE) of wheat was not much affected by intercropping, but it was reduced in cotton, due to delayed flowering and less reproductive growth. Total N-efficiency of the system was assessed by comparing the relative nitrogen yield total (RNT), i.e. the sum of the ratio's of total N-uptake by a component crop in the intercrop relative to the N-uptake in the monocrop, to the relative yield total. RNT ranged from 1.4 to 1.7, while the relative yield total (RYT) ranged from 1.3 to 1.4, indicating that intercrops used more nitrogen per unit production than monocrops. An analysis of the crop nitrogen balance showed that the nitrogen surplus of sole crops amounted to 220 kg ha(-1) for wheat and 140 kg ha(-1) for cotton, while in the intercropping systems, the annual N surplus exceeded 400 kg ha(-1). Conventional N-management in intercrops thus results in high N-surpluses that pose an environmental risk. The N management could be improved by means of a demand-based rate and timing of N applications.	"[Spiertz, J. H.

Growth, yield and quality of wheat and cotton in relay strip intercropping systems	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"crop growth analysis; grain yield; lint yield; land equivalence ratio (LER); fiber quality; expolinear growth equation; competition; growth delay"	CORN	Intercropping of wheat and cotton is practiced at a large scale in northern China, but the productivity of intercrops, compared to monoculture, and the productivity and growth patterns of different alternative intercropping patterns have not been quantitatively documented. In this study, four typical wheat-cotton intercropping patterns were examined as to their growth and productivity in field experiments over three growing seasons in Anyang, Henan Province, China. The systems varied in the number of wheat and cotton rows in the alternating strips of either crop, and were labeled accordingly as 3:1, 3:2, 4:2 and 6:2. Dry matter accumulation, yield, land equivalence ratio (LER) and lint quality were determined. Grain yield of wheat, averaged over three seasons, ranged from 4600 to 5200 kg ha(-1) in intercropping, corresponding to 70-79% of the yield in the monoculture (6550 kg ha(-1)). The 3:1 system gave the highest wheat yield (79% of monoculture), followed by the 6:2 (73%), 3:2 (70%) and 4:2 (70%) systems. Cotton lint yield, averaged over three seasons, ranged from 590 to 740 kg ha(-1) in intercropping, corresponding to 54-69% of the yield in cotton monoculture (1085 kg ha-1). The 3:2 and 4:2 systems gave the highest lint yields (69% and 68% of monoculture, respectively), which was significantly lower than in monoculture but significantly higher than in the 3:1 (58%) and 6:2 (54%) systems. The land equivalent ratio was 1.39 in the 3:1, 3:2 and 4:2 systems, and significantly lower, 1.28, in the 6:2 system. All systems provide a substantial land use advantage. Cotton growth patterns in monocultures and intercrops were characterized by fitting expolinear growth equations to periodic harvest data. Fitted parameters indicate a growth delay, compared to cotton monoculture, of 11.8 d in the 3:1 system, 6.3 d in the 3:2 system, 6.9 d in the 4:2 system and 5.6 d in the 6:2 system. Estimated growth rate during the linear growth phase was lowest in the 6:2 system (5.9 g m(-2) d(-1)), significantly greater in the 3:1 (7.0 g m(-2) d(-1)), 4:2 (7.7 g m(-2) d(-1)) and 3:2 (8.4 g m(-2) d(-1)) systems, and greatest, but not significantly different from 3:2 and 4:2 systems, in the monoculture (8.9 g m(-2) d(-1)). These results are interpreted in terms of the competitive effect of wheat during the seedling phase of cotton, which is strongestin the 3:1 system, causing a comparatively long growth delay, and the ability of the cotton leaf canopy to intercept radiation after wheat harvest, which is diminished in the 6:2 system due to the large distance between cotton rows, resulting in a comparatively low rate of linear growth. Effects of intercropping on the quality of cotton were minor and mostly below detection threshold. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Winter cereal, seeding rate, and intercrop seeding rate effect on red clover yield and quality	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							"FORAGE QUALITY; ALFALFA; CORN; ESTABLISHMENT; CROPS"	Diversification of corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] cropping systems can be achieved by incorporating winter cereal grains. Winter cereal grain production systems in the northern USA are inefficient in respect to annual radiation capture because the majority of these fields lay fallow until the following cropping season. The addition of a red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) intercrop to winter cereal grains can supply forage and provide N to subsequent crops. The objective of this study was to determine the red clover dry matter (DM) and forage quality response to winter cereal species, cereal seeding rate, and red clover seeding rate. Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and triticale (x Triticosecale spp.) were seeded at 100, 200, 300, and 400 seed m(-2) in October 2002 and 2003. In March, red clover was frost-seeded at 300, 600, 900, 1200, and 1500 seed m(-2). Red clover harvests in late summer, early fall, and the following spring yielded 6.2 to 8.5 Mg ha(-1) DM. Winter cereal species only affected red clover DM in the following spring of 1 yr. Cereal seeding rates impacted DM within specific harvest periods, but had no effect on seasonal totals or spring DM. Increasing red clover seeding rates increased final DM yield in four of six harvests. Increasing red clover seeding rate had no consistent effect on forage quality. Producers that intercrop, red clover in winter wheat or triticale should frost-seed at 900 to 1200 seed m(-2) to maximize DM yield.

After large scale commercial use of transgenic Bt cotton, cotton aphids became one of the most important cotton pests. A 2-year study was conducted to evaluate the role of four winter wheat varieties that were resistant or susceptible to wheat aphid, Sitobion avenae Fabricius (Homoptera: Aphididae), in conserving arthropod natural enemies and suppressing cotton aphids in a wheat-cotton relay intercropping system in northern China. The results indicated that wheat-cotton intercropping preserved and augmented natural enemies more than a monoculture of cotton. The density of natural enemies in cotton was significantly different among relay-intercropping fields with different wheat varieties. The highest density of natural enemies and low cotton aphid populations were found in the treatment of cotton in relay intercropped with the wheat variety Lovrin10, which is susceptible to wheat aphid. The lowest density of predators and parasitoids associated with high cotton aphid populations were found with the wheat variety KOK1679, which is resistant to wheat aphid. The results showed that wheat varieties that are susceptible or moderately resistant to wheat aphid might reduce cotton aphids more effectively than an aphid-resistant variety in the intercropping system by enhancing predators to suppress cotton aphids during the cotton seedling stage.

This study was initiated to determine if N yield and land use efficiency for N could be improved by manipulating crop diversity using three annual crops (wheat, Triticum aestivum L.; canola, Brassica napus L.; and field pea, Pisum arvense L.) commonly grown on the Canadian Prairies. The study included all combinations of the crops (sole crops and intercrops) and compared their effects on soil N depletion, plant N concentration, plant N yield, and land equivalent ratios for dry matter and grain N yield (NLER) at two field sites in Manitoba, Canada. The pea sole crop treatment tended to result in higher fall soil nitrate (NO3-)-N concentrations compared to other treatments, indicating greater potential for post-season NO3- leaching after this treatment. There were often greater N concentrations in wheat, canola, and weeds when grown in association with field pea, suggesting that soil N could have been made available for nonlegume uptake through the NO3--N sparing effect. On average, most intercrop treatments resulted in more efficient land use for N compared to component sole crops, with over-all mean intercrop NLER values ranging from 1.10 to 1.20.

Under limited water environments, competition for soil water between intercropped plants may be strong. Furthermore, the increasing soil compaction problems, due to the use of heavy machinery, may intensify competition for limited resources, particularly in the topsoil. Two field trials were Conducted to evaluate the water competition ability of intercropped pearl millet when subjected to drought and soil compaction during the 2004 Japanese summer. For this purpose plant water Sources were determined by the hydrogen stable isotope (deuterium) technique. Plant water relations and biomass production were also evaluated. According to the deuterium concentration values in xylem sap, pearl millet water sources were changed by the Competition With cowpea. Pearl millet was forced to rely more on recently supplied (irrigation/rainfall) water. In contrast, the water sources of cowpea were unchanged by plant Competition. When plants were subjected to drought, the transpiration rate of pearl millet was reduced by 40 % of its monocropped potential by Competition, but that of cowpea was not. Moreover, intercropped pearl Millet, under drought and soil compaction, showed lower leaf water potential and biomass than their respective monocropped Counterparts. Cowpea had a higher competitive ratio tinder vet, dry, and compaction treatments, while pearl millet was more competitive under loose conditions. In conclusion, under drought and soil compaction, water competition restricted the water use of intercropped pearl millet, forcing pearl millet to shift to the recently supplied water. In contrast, cowpea did not show air), significant changes under these stress conditions.

Competition between triticale (Triticosecale Witt.) and field beans (Vicia faba var. minor L.) in additive intercrops	PLANT SOIL AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"cereal-legume interaction; components of yield; protein yield; competitive balance index"		In a microplot experiment conducted in 1999 and 2000 on light soil triticale and field beans were grown as sole crops and in the intercrop system. Two pure stand plant densities were established: 200 and 400 plants/m(2) for triticale and 50 and 100 plants/m(2) for field beans. Four possible intercropping combinations were obtained by adding densities of both crops. Triticale was a better competitor than field beans in all intercrops resulting in competitive balance index significantly greater than zero. The number of pods per plant of field beans was significantly reduced in all intercropping combinations compared to the pure stands, however quality of grain of the legume was unaffected by competition. Intercrop comprising 200 plants/m(2) of triticale and 50 plants/m(2) of field beans was most productive in the experiment but addition 50 more plants/m(2) of the legume decreased significantly grain yield of intercrop by 16.2%. The results also show that effective triticale-field beans intercrop for light soil may be designed as additive one, based on 400 plants/m(2) of triticale.

In this field experiment, we investigated agronomic performance and weed suppression by three crops-spring wheat (Triticum aestivum), canola (Brassica napus), and field pea (Pisum sativum)-alone and in all possible combinations at two sites in Manitoba, Canada, from 2001 to 2003. Crop treatments were planted at the same total density (144 seeds m(-2)). The effects of the different crop combinations on weed recruitment and biomass and crop production were studied in both the presence and absence of in-crop herbicides. The agronomic performance of intercrop and sole crop treatments varied greatly across site-years. Some intercrop treatments (e.g., wheat-canola and wheat-canola-pea) tended to produce greater weed suppression compared with sole component crops, indicating synergism among crops within intercrops with regard to weed suppression. Intercrop treatments resulted in land-equivalent ratios (LER) > 1 (i.e., overyielding) in both the presence and absence of in-crop herbicides. In the presence of herbicides, canola-pea was the most consistent intercrop treatment in terms of overyielding for grain (mean LER = 1.22), whereas in the absence of herbicides, wheat-canola-pea produced the most consistent overyielding frequency for dry matter production (mean LER = 1.28). In the presence of herbicides, overall grain yield stability was greatest for the wheat-canola-pea intercrop treatment. Results indicate that annual intercrops can enhance both weed suppression and crop production compared with sole crops.

Intercropping peppermint with soybean resulted in yield and quality increases in the essential oil, compared to sole peppermint cultivation. The yield was higher by about 50% on an equal land area basis and higher percentages of menthol and lower percentages of menthofuran and menthyl acetate improved the quality of the oil. Intercropped peppermint leaf number per node, leaf area, perimeter and leaf area index (LAI) were greater along with the internode length and thickness, when compared to monocultured plants. Total leaf peltate trichome number was higher in intercropped peppermint plants and was positively correlated with greater essential oil productivity. Leaf and stem dry weight were higher in intercropped peppermint. Total chlorophyll and carotenoid content also increased in intercropped peppermint plants, whereas no variation was found for total soluble protein. In peppermint, no significant differences were found in the CO2 compensation point between the two cropping systems, whereas intercropped plants showed a higher stomatal conductance at low CO2 concentration. The relationship between primary and secondary peppermint plant metabolism was also discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An experiment was conducted over two growing seasons in 1998 and 1999 to determine the impact of a white clover intercrop on spring oat (Avena sativa L.) growth and grain yield at three different seeding rates of oat, and also to determine the effect of the three different white clover cultivars (cv. Aran, cv. S 184 and cv. Milo), on weed pressure and growth of the oat crop. The clover cultivars differed in stolon morphology and leaf size. Oat in monoculture was included for comparison. The white clover intererops did not reduce the weed pressure compared with oat in monoculture. Oat grain nitrogen concentration and content was raised in the intercropped oats. Grain yields in an intercrop were similar to those in a monoculture. Oat seeding densities did not affect grain yields. The oat grain yields in 1998 were significantly higher with S184 as intercrop. In 1999 it was directly opposite, grain yields were significantly lower with S184 as intercrop.

The plots were arranged in a randomized complete block design for a 3 by 2 factorial experiment(soybean monoculture, corn monoculture, strip intercropping of soybean-corn x no-tillage, conventional tillage). Each treatment was replicated four times. The arthropods were sampled by pitfall traps during 1996-1998. Statistically significant results from at least one season indicated that no-tillage was favorable to predators like ants (Brachymyrmex sp., Camponotus spp. and Ectatomma sp.), carabids (Metius sp.) and Araneae (Lycosidae). Strip intercropping increased the number of Acrididae, while the presence of corn was favorable to the occurrence of Dermaptera in strip intercropping of soybean and corn.

Field experiments were conducted for two years to examine the performance of two contrasting genotypes of each of these crops grown both as sole crops and as intercrops using all possible genotypic combinations of the pearl miller with the clusterbean. The seed yields of both crops were always lower in intercropping than in sole cropping, though the degree of reduction in the seed yield of each intercrop component was influenced greatly by the genotype of its companion crop. The seed yield of both clusterbean genotypes was reduced more when intercropped with the tall and late-maturing pearl miller, MH 179, than with the medium-statured and early-maturing HHB 67. On the other hand, the two clusterbean cultivars had similar effects on intercropped pearl miller. As a result, the highest land equivalent ratios (LERs) were obtained with intercrops containing pearl miller HHB 67 rather than MH 179, while the genotype of clusterbean had little overall effect on LER. The results obtained are discussed in the context of developing cultivars for intercropping.

Introduction of these species along with spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was studied as a means of increasing ground cover during their initial establishment period, without reducing wheat grain yield. Two experiments were conducted in nearby areas, one in each year. Birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) cultivar Quinequelli, white clover (T repens L.), and arrowleaf clover (T vesiculosum Savi) did not reduce cereal yield in either year. Wheat yield was reduced by intercropped red clover cultivar Kenland and by subclover (T subterraneum L.) in the first year. No grain yield differences due to intercropping with any legume were detected in the second year, when rainfall was below normal. Intercropping with wheat showed to be a practical alternative to enhance ground cover at establishing forage legumes.

The yield of millable cane from the planted sugarcane was not affected by intercropped green manuring or plant arrangement but was increased by fertilizer N after both wheat and mustard. The residues from the green manuring and fertilizer N both increased the yield of the following crop of ratoon sugarcane by 9-10% with the residues increasing the numbers and length of millable canes and the fertilizer N the number, girth and weight of the millable canes. None of the treatments affected the quality of cane juice in either the planted cane or the ratoon crop. Residues from the green manures and the N fertilizer treatments increased the organic carbon content and available N in the soils.

Subsequent effects of this practice on hard red spring wheat (HRSW) [Triticum aestivum (L.) Emend. Thell.] yield and protein content were unknown. Our objective was to quantify effects of intercropping various legumes into sunflower on spring soil nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) and grain yield and protein content of a subsequent HRSW crop. Field experiments were conducted near Carrington and Prosper, ND, from 1993 through 1995. Wheat was planted into non-legume plots and those previously intercropped with hairy vetch( Vicia villosa Roth), yellow-flowered sweetclover (Melilotus officinalis Lam.), alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), snail medic [Medicago scutellata (L.) Mill.], or black lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.). Soil NO3--N (0-30 cm) in plots previously intercropped with hairy vetch (411 kg ha(-1)) was greater than control plots (26 kg ha(-1)). Yield of HRSW was reduced at both Carrington and Prosper in 1993 when grown after a sweetclover intercrop. Yield of HRSW was reduced at Carrington in 1993 when grown after an alfalfa intercrop. Wheat grown after sweetclover intercropped in sunflower had higher protein content (142.0 g kg(-1)) than HRSW grown after sunflower (140.6 g kg(-1)) alone. Overall, intercropping hairy vetch at the V4 sunflower growth stage appears superior because it did not reduce sunflower yield, provided soil cover adding between 540 and 2400 kg ha(-1) above ground dry matter to the system, and increased NO3--N levels at the beginning of the HRSW season in two environments.

CMI treatments differed in the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied and herbicide used and in the rigor of tillage operations. Cereal aphids (primarily Rhopalosiphum padi, Sitobion avenae, and Schizaphis graminum) collectively infested a mean of 0 to 5.9 of 15 wheat tillers sampled per plot on various dates from 1990 through 1993, but aphid infestation aid not vary by CMI. Seven taxa of aphid predators predominated: Nabis spp., Chrysoperla spp., Coleomegilla maculata, Hippodamia convergens, H. tredecimpunctata tibialis, H. parenthesis, and Coccinella septempunctata. Coccinella transversoguttata richardsoni, a species in decline in eastern South Dakota, was not collected. Nabids were generally the most abundant predatory taxon. In 1992, coccinellid adults were more abundant in high than low CMI plots. In 1993, H. tredecimpunctata tibialis adults were significantly more abundant in high CMI plots on the first three sampling dates but became more abundant in the low and intermediate CMI plots by the fifth sampling date. Regressions between the number of aphid-infested tillers and abundance of some predator taxa were significant in 1990, 1991, and 1992. In 1990, most regressions showed that counts of predators (except Chrysoperla spp. adults) were inversely proportional to aphid infestation levels, whereas significant regressions in 1991 and 1992 showed that the abundances of predators were weakly proportional to aphid infestation levels. Adjusted r(2) Values for all significant regressions ranged from 0.07 to 0.27. Relationships between crop management, cereal aphid infestation, and aphidophagous predators are discussed.

J	"Lesoing, GW; Francis, CA"				"Lesoing, GW; Francis, CA"			Strip intercropping effects on yield and yield components of corn, grain sorghum, and soybean	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							"SOIL-WATER; GROWTH; SYSTEM"	"Strip intercropping of corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.] and grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] and soybean may be a viable alternative to monoculture cropping to help reduce soil erosion. Careful study of yields and yield components can add to understanding crop performance and contribute to design of more productive systems. Rainfed and irrigated experiments were conducted in eastern Nebraska from 1988 to 1990, on a Sharpsburg silty clay loam (fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Argiudoll), to quantify strip-intercropping effects on crop yields and geld components. Corn border-row and grain sorghum border-row yields next to soybean increased significantly compared with inside rows in the strips. Increased seed number and seed weight contributed to higher corn border-row yields, while only seed number increased in grain sorghum border rows. Soybean border-row yields were lower next to all corn strips and nest to grain sorghum strips at the rainfed site. Soybean seed number was lower in border rows next to corn. Corn border-row increases in seed number and seed weight indicate that competition for resources was important in both reproductive and grain-filling periods; sorghum border-row increases in seed number suggest competition only in the reproductive period. Higher corn density in border rows mag further exploit a competitive advantage with soybean in the reproductive period, perhaps increasing system productivity. Whole-system productivity of strip-intercropping systems was a maximum of 4% higher than monocultures of component crops, and gross returns did not differ between the two systems. If there is need to control soil erosion, strip intercropping can be equally profitable to monoculture if production costs are similar."

Our objectives were to quantify yield and forage quality response of forage soybean [Glycine mar (L,) Merr,] intercropped with forage sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] and compare to the measurements of monocrop soybean. Soybean plants were harvested from the middle portion of individual rows in plots containing only soybean and from plots having alternating soybean and sorghum rows spaced 76 cm apart. Morphological and forage quality measurements were determined on leaf and stem fractions. Morphological measurements included main stem length, node number, leaf area ratio (LAR), specific leaf weight (SLW), and stem diameter. Forage quality constituents included in vitro dry matter disappearance (IVDMD), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), hemicellulose, and cellulose, and crude protein (CP) concentrations. Intercropped soybean had 6 more plants m(-1) of row, less advanced morphological development, and 2.3 Mg ha(-1) less dry matter than monocrop soybean. Leaf IVDMD, NDF, hemicellulose, and cellulose did not differ between intercrop and monocrop soybean. However, stem IVDMD was 33 g kg(-1) greater for intercropped than monocrop soybean, reflecting: the 36 g kg(-1) decrease in NDF concentration. Intercropped soybean was lodged both years more than monocrop soybean, which may have been due to the significant decrease in stem NDF. Leaf CP concentration was 25 g kg(-1) greater for monocrop soybean than intercropped soybean; however, stems from intercropped soybean had 12 g kg(-1) greater CP than monocrop soybean stems. Soybean exhibited a high degree of morphological plasticity, presumably in response to increased competition for solar radiation. Although forage quality of intercrop soybean was greater than monocrop soybean, intercropping forage-type soybean with another tall-growing forage does not appear to be practical because of the decrease in dry matter accumulation."

J	"Lesoing, GW; Francis, CA"				"Lesoing, GW; Francis, CA"			Strip intercropping of corn-soybean in irrigated and rainfed environments	JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE			English	Article							YIELDS	A strip intercropping system of corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Clycine Mau (L.) Merrill] has the potential to reduce soil erosion and increase the biological and economic efficiencies of a corn-soybean rotational system, The objective of this study was to evaluate grain production in a corn-soybean strip intercropping system under irrigated and rainfed conditions in eastern Nebraska. Corn and soybean were grown in alternating 20 ft, (eight-row) strips in a north-south orientation on a Sharpsburg silty clay loam (fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Argiudolls) at the University of Nebraska Agricultural Research and Development Center near Mead. A full-season corn hybrid was grown in strips in combination with soybean cultivars of different maturity groups. Yields of the two border rows of corn and soybean strips were machine harvested and compared with the middle four rows of each crop strip to determine border effects. Under irrigated conditions, corn yields in the outside two rows increased in 4 of 5 yr, A maximum yield increase of 28 bu/acre occurred in 1986, with a 5-yr average increase of 17 bu/acre (11%) in the corn borders. Under rainfed conditions, corn border row yield increases were less consistent, averaging 5 bu/acre, In 1989, a maximum corn yield increase of 19 bu/acre (23%) was obtained in the rainfed environments. Soybean yields were reduced in the outside two border rows compared with the middle four rows under both rainfed and irrigated environments. Yields from soybean rows adjacent to corn were reduced an average of 6 bu/acre over the 5-yr period, Land Equivalent Ratios (LER = land area needed in monoculture to equal production in one unit area of intercropping) averaged 1.00 and 0.96 for the irrigated and rainfed strip intercropping systems, respectively, suggesting no benefit under either condition for the multispecies systems. Although economics of the system are dependent on corn and soybean prices, results of these experiments indicate strip intercropping systems of corn-soybean show no consistent differences in systems yield or net returns compared with monoculture fields under the same conditions. Strip intercropping will then benefit by reducing erosion on soybean stubble.

J	"Rao, SC; Phillips, WA"				"Rao, SC; Phillips, WA"			Forage production and nutritive value of three lespedeza cultivars intercropped into continuous no-till winter wheat	JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE			English	Article							WATER	Annual lespedezas [Kummerowia stipulacea (Maxim) Makin] have the potential to produce high quality forage during late summer when warm season forages are low in production and quality. A field study was conducted from 1992 through 1994 to determine DM, N, and digestible dry matter (DDM) production of three annual lespedeza cultivars (Korean, Kobe, and Marion), These cultivars were intercropped into two different continuous winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production systems. Wheat was established in the fall under low tillage procedures in a 24-acre field, and grazed by steers from mid-November to mid-March at a stocking rate of 1 steer/acre. Before the wheat had reached the jointing stage, small plots were identified within the 24-acre wheat field. Inoculated lespedeza seeds were sown into the standing winter wheat in these plots, but grazing was continued on the plots and the field. At jointing, grazing was terminated on half of the plots (UNGRAZED), while the other half of the plots were grazed (GRAZED) until early May Samples of lespedeza were collected at 18 to 20 d intervals beginning in late-June and ending in late-September, in time for the next wheat crop to be planted. All treatments were fixed is space and repeated on the same plots each year Data were analyzed within year as a randomized complete block with cultivar as the main effect. In 1993 and 1994 Kobe produced DM, N, and DDM more (P < 0.05) under the UNGRAZED than the GRAZED management system. Management system had no effect on DM, N or DDM yield of Korean. When precipitation was above normal, Marion yielded more (P < 0.05) DM in the UNGRAZED plots than in the GRAZED plots, but Marion yield was inferior to that of Kobe and Korean under dry conditions. These results suggest that lespedeza can be intercropped in winter wheat to produce high quality forage during the summer. The availability of high quality forage, especially in late summer, can add sustainability to the livestock component of integrated Livestock and winter wheat production systems in the southern Great plains (SGP).

J	Gregorova, H				Gregorova, H			Quality of above-ground biomass of amaranth (Amaranthus mantegazzianus L.) after winter intercrop triticale	ROSTLINNA VYROBA			Czech	Article						"amaranth; yield; above-ground biomass; crude protein content; fibre content; mineral elements; microelements"	YIELD	In the years 1992 to 1994 the quality of amaranth Amaranthus mantegazzianus L., the Elbrus variety, cultivated after winter intercrop triticale Dagro was investigated. Trials were performed in irrigation-free conditions of south Slovakia, experimental station of Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra-Dolna Malanta. The site belongs to warm and moderate arid climatic region with average annual sum of precipitation 561 mm, for the growing season 327 mm. Average gaily air temperature is 9.7 degrees C, for the growing season 16.2 degrees C. Soil of experimental site is learn, in the subsoil horizon clay loam luvisol with medium content of humus and high content of nutrients. Amaranth was seeded after harvest of winter intercrop in the second half of May, only in 1992 at the beginning of June in two row spacings (0.375 and 0.500 m). After full emergence plants were singled to 400 thousand of plants per 1 ha and the stand was heed twice during the growing season. Amaranth produced 3.79 to 8.54 t.ha(-1) of dry matter, higher yields were obtained under row spacing of 375 mm (Tab. Ill). Very low yields in 1993 were connected with delayed emergence (for strong overdrying of soil profile during growth of triticale amaranth started to emerge at the beginning of July), growth and development in conditions of shortening day and with approximately lower average daily temperatures by 4 degrees C during growing season of amaranth compared with the years 1992 and 1994 (Tab. II). The content of main nutrients in different organs of amaranth (Tab. V), the content of nutrients including microelements in the time of harvest at the onset of anthesis (Tab. TV), changes ill qualitative indicators during ontogenesis of amaranth (Tab. VI), withdrawal of nutrients by harvest (Tab. VII) and the effect of row spacing on the content of main nutrients were investigated (Fig. I). On average of experimental years amaranth in I kg of dry matter contained 129.93 g crude protein. 221.30 g fibre, 38.40 g fats, 3.66 g NO3-N, 3.48 g P, 20.03 g Ca, 9.21 g Mg, 35.53 g K and 0.37 g Na. High content of K was compensated by high content of bivalent cations of Ca and Rig, and therefore the values of tetanic ratio were low (Tab. IV). During ontogenesis of amaranth the content of crude pl olein, amino acids and mineral elements was failing, while the fibre content was increasing. The effect of row spacing on the content of main nutrients was not unambiguous (Fig. I). Above-ground biomass of amaranth on average for experimental years withdrew from 1 ha: 140.7 kg N, 23.57 kg P, 135.62 kg Ca, 62.32 kg Mg, 240.50 kg K and 2.49 kg Na. Of the microelements this ranged from 0.2 g (Cd) to 961.5 g (Fe) per 1 ha. It can be said that the quality of above-ground biomass of amaranth is in many indicators comparable with the quality of our most important fodder crop - lucerne.

To investigate the effects of different oat and berseem clover cultivars on the productivity of the intercrop and its components, and to test for interspecific cultivar interactions, we evaluated binary combinations and monocultures of a sample of oat and berseem clover cultivars in three Iowa environments. Oat cultivars varied for oat traits, effects on clover stands and yield, and total intercrop biomass. Berseem clover cultivars varied for forage yield, stand, maturity, damage due to disease and insects, and effects on intercrop biomass. In one environment, only one of seven berseem clover cultivars survived after the first forage harvest. Adding oat to berseem clover reduced total forage and weed yields, clover stands, and relative maturity of clover, but increased total crop biomass and forage plant health. Adding berseem clover to oat did not reduce oat grain or straw yields, and in one year increased oat test weight. Cultivar rankings of each species differed in monoculture vs. intercrop. Interspecific cultivar interactions were not significant for most traits. Greater genetic improvement in the productivity of the oat-berseem clover intercrop will more likely be achieved by improvement of general agronomic productivity of berseem clover than by trying to enhance specific ecological combining ability of particular oat and berseem clover cultivar combinations.

Different purposes were considered regarding different patterns of cowpea-pigeon pea intercropping and were arranged in a randomized complete block design way. In the sole cowpea purpose (T1), the population growth curves of the two insects were opposite. In purpose T2 where cowpea was grown surrounded by pigeon pea plants and in purpose T4 where both cultures were intercropped with one pigeon pea row after two cowpea rows, both pest populations showed normal distributions with different amplititudes. In all cases, infestations probabilities of M. sjostedi on flowers were higher than those of M. vitrata. The evaluation of cowpea-pigeon pea intercropping is clearly conclusive concerning the cowpea newer infestations by M. sjosredti. Indeed, this insect infests much significantly the flowers in purpose T1 in comparison with those in purposes T2 and T4 which are statistically equivalent. The results obtained give a better understanding of the insect host plant relationship in the complex environment of applied agricultural entomology.

The disparity between the values of land-equivalent ratio and monetary equivalent ratio indicates that substantial agronomic advantage does not guarantee an economic advantage in intercropping.

Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and Westerwolds ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) were seeded on all intercrop plots. Dry-matter (DM) yield, crude protein (CP) and organic matter digestibility (Ohio) were measured. DM yield and N content were used to estimate legume N fixation. Experiment 1 was conducted at both sites, At the lower site, Persian clover (Trifolium resupinatum L.) and annual alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) accounted for 70% of the DM yield in harvest 1 (July), increased CP and OMD, but did not affect intercrop yield. They increased harvest 2 (August/September) intercrop yield by 263% and CP concentration by 65 g k g(-1) DM. They increased harvest 3 (October) yield by 275% and CP concentration by 78 g kg(-1) DM. Inclusion of striate lespedeza (Lespedeza striata) did not affect intercrop yield or quality. Annual legumes failed to establish at the higher elevation sire and therefore had no effect on Dh? yield or forage quality. In Experiment 2, in which the performance of Westerwolds ryegrass was also compared with that of Italian ryegrass, and conducted at the lower site only, Persian clover and berseem clover (T. alexandrinum L.) increased CP of all three of the year's harvests, These two species contributed 29% of the DM yield in the first harvest (July) but did not affect total intercrop yield, They increased harvest 2 (August) yield by 313%. Persian clover increased harvest 3 (October) yield by 318% and berseem clover increased harvest 3 yield by 405%. Barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) and snail medic (M. scutellata) contributed 29% of harvest 1 yield, and increased both DM yield and CP content, Medics did nor regrow. Aubade Westerwolds ryegrass contributed a greater percentage of the DM yield than did Maris Ledger Italian ryegrass at harvests 1 and 2. Ryegrass type did not affect total DM yield but did affect forage quality; intercrops containing the Italian ryegrass had higher CP at harvest 2 and higher OMD at harvest 3 than those containing the Westerwolds ryegrass. Over both experiments, at the lower elevation site, stands with Persian clover, berseem clover or alfalfa produced 80% of the yield of barley-ryegrass receiving 250 kg N ha(-1), and 165% of the yield of unfertilized barley-ryegrass, Berseem and Persian clover fixed about the same amount of N over the growing season; 188 kg N ha(-1)in Experiment 1 and 134 kg N ha(-1) in Experiment 2."

Marked and unmarked populations of Japanese beetles were monitored using trap and direct observation census methods in a replicated field research design. Significantly lower densities of Japanese beetles were found in the intercropped treatment compared to the monoculture treatment. Rates of dispersal were also significantly decreased in the intercropped treatment. Results suggest that inter-cropping should be a component of integrated pest management in the control of a generalist herbivore species such as the Japanese beetle.

We hypothesized that strip intercrops of canola (Brassica napus L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] would increase seed, oil, and protein yields compared with sole crops. Canola (cv. Global) was grown in 4.5-m wide strips adjacent to 4.5-m strips of later-planted soybean (cv. Chippewa) at Rosemount, MN, in 1991 and 1992, and at St Paul, MN, in 1992. Zero or 134 kg N ha(-1) was applied at planting in the Rosemount studies, and 134 kg N ha(-1) was applied at St. Paul. Seed yield, oil, and crude protein (CP) concentrations were determined for individual rows. Land equivalent ratios (LER) were calculated, using inner rows of the strip to represent sole crop yields. Canola border row yields were 225 to 590% of those of sole crop rows. Without N fertilization, soybean border row yields were similar to sole crop rows, but with added N fertilizer were only 50 to 65% of the sole crop yields. Projected LERs (range: 1.02 to 1.65) were significantly greater than 1.0 for strip widths of 1 to 4 m without N, and 1 to 6 m with fertilizer N. Strip intercrops produced edible oil and CP yields up to 170% of the mean of the two sole crops. Intercropping canola and soybean in strips has the potential to reduce fertilizer applications and enhance oil and protein yields compared with sole crops.

Bieb.) is a slow-establishing rhizomatous perennial that has fewer seed yields the year after establishment than in subsequent years of production. For new forage crops such as kura clover to be utilized, adequate seed supplies must be available. The objective of this research was to determine whether 'Rhizo' kura clover grown for seed can be established with intercropped wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to increase seed grower net income. Kura clover was planted in spring 1989 and 1990. The clover was grown alone (sole-cropped) and intercropped with companion-planted wheat in 15- and 30-cm rows and with relay-planted wheat in 20- and 40-cm rows. The clover was established with sprinkler irrigation. Sole-crop kura clover establishment was superior to clover intercropped with wheat. When clover was grown with intercropped wheat, establishment was superior with wide-spaced compared to narrow-spaced wheat. The delay in clover establishment from spring-planted clover relay-intercropped with fall-planted wheat was similar to spring-planted clover companion-intercropped with wheat. Kura clover was more tolerant of relay- than companion-intercropping because clover seedlings were allowed to establish before the onset of wheat crop competition. Spring-planted kura clover relay-intercropped with fall-planted wheat in 40-cm rows had the greatest economic return of all treatments.

Treatments included two monocultures of oilseed rape (8 kg/ha of live seed) and field pea (200 kg/ha of live seed) and three intercropped mixtures of field pea to oilseed rape (150:2, 100:4, and 50:6 [kg/ha]). Flea beetle counts per 0.5 m2 were highest in the oilseed rape monoculture in all 3 yr of the study but significantly higher from the other treatments in only one year. The sex ratio of P. cruciferae adults collected was not influenced by the treatments. The land equivalent ratios (LER = [intercropped yield for pea/monoculture yield for pea] + [intercroppe yield for rape/monoculture yield for rape]) for the intercrop treatments did not exceed 1.0, indicating that the intercrops selected were not as efficient for yield as the monocultures. This intercrop system was not effective in reducing flea beetle loads on a per-plant basis, nor was there a yield advantage from this intercrop system.

Of the three populations tested (2: 2, 2: 1 and 3: 1 row ratios of wheat: chickpea), the 2: 2 row ratio allowed more light interception and transmission to the lower canopy and gave significantly higher yield (4155 kg/ha wheat equivalent) and land equivalent ratio (LER) than the other treatments. Chickpea yields were reduced more than those of wheat under all intercropping systems and the reduction was largest at the 3: 1 row ratio. Wheat (cv. Sonalika) was more productive than chickpea (cv.

Variance due to genotypes was significant for grain yield (kg/ha), harvest index (%), grain yield (g)/plant and number of pods/plant, indicating the presence of genetic variation among genotypes of soybean ('JS 71-05', 'Amass 21', 'PK 416') and pigeonpea ('AS 71-37'', 'C 11', 'ICPL 8357'). The most stable intercropping combination of soybean and pigeonpea was obtained from 'JS 71-05' and 'AS 71-37', as it produced higher grain yield (2 361 kg/ha) than the other intercropping treatments, being near the significant unit values (0.988*, 1.003**) of their regression coefficients (bi) respectively. The intercropping of soybean-pigeonpea genotypes gave land-equivalent ratio of 1.17-1.62. Only 7 intercropping treatments of soybean and pigeonpea genotypes out of 9 intercropping treatments gave an economic advantages of 3% (monetary equivalent ratio = 1.03) to 22% (monetary equivalent ratio = 1.22) compared with the most economic sole crop in respect to grain yield. The disparity between the values of land-equivalent ratio and monetary equivalent ratio indicates that substantial agronomic advantage does not guarantee an economic advantage in intercropping.

Our objective was to determine if wheat yield could be maintained while also producing an economic yield of flax. Two high yielding wheat cultivars, 'Amidon' and 'Grandin', were sown at 65 lb/acre in a monoculture and intercropped with 'Linton' flax sown at 32 lb/acre. North Dakota dryland management was used in 1989 and 1990, but supplemental irrigation also was evaluated in 1990. Intercrop patterns included establishment of both crops in the same row, in alternate rows, and in plots where flax was broadcast seeded into wheat. An additional intercrop pattern was included during 1990; flax and wheat were seeded in rows perpendicular to each other. Compared with sole cropping, intercropping reduced flax yield more than 90%, and sometimes reduced wheat yield by almost 25% (P < 0.05). Economic returns were generally greater for a monoculture of wheat or flax than for intercrops. Land equivalent ratios (LERs) failed to indicate any advantage for intercropping. This study shows that an economic flax yield is not produced when a monoculture wheat population (app. 20 plants/sq ft) is established in a wheat-flax intercrop. Work is needed to determine if the economic performance of wheat-flax intercrops is improved when the seeding rate for wheat is considerably less than in a monoculture."

A 3-yr study was conducted in farmer's fields at two locations in South Western Niger to investigate yield response of six cowpea cultivars to applied P-fertilizer (0, 8, 16 kg ha-1) when intercropped with millet. Significant yield differences were found between cultivars for their seed and dry fodder yield at all rates of applied P. Cultivars responded differently to the application of P. Millet grain was more than doubled with the addition of 8 to 16 kg P ha-1. Cowpea cultivars did not have significant differential effect on millet yields. Cowpea cultivars differed significantly in the accumulation of P in fodder with the highest yielding cultivars taking up more P than the low yielding ones. The results have important implications for breeding and selection of cowpea cultivars that are adapted to a range of fertility levels.

Merr.] intercropping system at Bangalore revealed that the yield of sunflower component was reduced by 23% and that of soybean by 37% in intercropping compared with their respective sole crops. However, the total productivity of the intercropping system as a whole in terms of total oil yield (4.82 q/ha), gross income (Rs 5,974/ha) and land equivalent ratio (1.39) was far-superior to pure cropping of either sunflower (4.08 q/ha, Rs 4,261/ha and 1.00 respectively) or of soybean (2.69 q/ha, Rs 4,309/ha and 1.00 respectively). Increase in soybean population in intercropping from 50 to 75% of its sole crop markedly improved its seed yield. Further increase to 100% had no significant effect either on its own yield or on the sunflower yield or on the total productivity. Uniform row planting of sunflower component was conducive for better growth and yield of sunflower and soybean with 5.05 q/ha of oil compared to paired row system with 4.58 q/ha.

Crops were grown for grain on the same plots under rainfed conditions in 1986, 1987 and 1988 crop seasons and all crop residues were removed from experimental plots. Millet/cowpea intercrop systems 1 and 2 WAMP produced 1.48 and 1.43 land-equivalent ratios (LER). Soil analysis in the beginning of the 1989 crop season indicated significantly higher OM (29%) and Mg following the use of cowpea in the preceding years than other treatments. Residual effects were evaluated by planting a crop of millet on all plots with 0, 30 and 60 kg N ha-1 as urea applied to subplots in two split applications. Nitrogen uptake of the succeeding millet crop was significantly greater at higher-level N treatments (30 and 60 kg N ha-1) and in previous cropping system cowpea sole and 1 and 2 WAMP. In general, grain-yields of the test crops were better following preceding cropping systems which had high cowpea yields.

All the cowpea cultivars took less time to mature when planted three weeks after millet than when sown one week after. Early-maturing cowpea cultivars had the smallest yield, whereas the yield of the local indeterminate cultivar was nearly double that of the other cultivars at both dates of sowing. Early planting of cowpea significantly depressed millet yield, but when cowpea was planted late millet yields approached those of the sole crop. The local cultivar depressed millet yields more than the other cowpea cultivars. Planting pattern had no significant effect on the yield of either cowpea or millet. Cowpea yield was reduced by more than 50% by two weeks delay in sowing, confirming that the sowing date of cowpea relative to millet is a critical factor in the Sahelian pearl millet/cowpea intercropping system. There were marked differences in the effect of cowpea cultivar on millet yield but these differences were consistent over sowing dates.

The weed biomass and diversity, as measured by species richness, were recorded for all unweeded treatments. The crop yields and land equivalent ratios (LERs) were determined for all treatments. Weed biomass was significantly reduced compared to sole crops by intercrops of fava:lettuce in 1:1 and 2:2 row arrangements, by fava:pea in 1:1, 1:2 and 2:1 row arrangements, but not by pea:lettuce in any row arrangement. Weed diversity was not significantly different compared to sole crops for all intercrop treatments. Yield reductions by weeds in the intercrops ranged from 23 to 40% for lettuce, from 19 to 42% for fava, and from 15 to 50% for pea. Yield reductions by weeds were dependent on crop combination and row arrangement, not necessarily weed biomass, and suggested treatment differences on critical times for weed interference. LERs for all intercrop treatments were greater than 1.0, except for the weeded 2fava:21ettuce, 2pea:1lettuce and 1fava:1pea plots, and were always greater under unweeded conditions.

This study compared eight-row strips of corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] with unstripped eight-row checks. Corn strips were evaluated with and without extra population and N for outside rows. The trials were conducted from 1986 through 1990 on highly productive prairie soils near Lafayette, IN. Yields were checked by row within eight-row strips. Stripping increased yield of outside corn rows by an average of 25.8% and decreased yield of outside soybean rows by 26.6%, but had much less effect on yield of second rows in strips. The yield of the center six soybean rows was reduced slightly by stripping. Corn strips with extra population and N yielded 20.0 bu/acre more than nonstripped corn with regular management. Stripped soybean averaged 5.9 bu/acre less than unstripped soybean. Net profit was not increased by strip-intercropping under conditions of this study. Additional management variables that may improve stripping profitability must be evaluated.

Several different clover varieties, sowing methods, plant spacings, planting dates and rates of phosphorus application were compared. Planting in single or double alternative rows 20 cm apart did not affect wheat grain and straw yield but broadcast sowing of Trifolium in wheat rows 20 cm apart reduced wheat yield. The Trifolium species used significantly affected legume yield. Phosphorus fertilizer increased yield significantly, especially that of the legume component. The trials indicated that the intercropping of Ethiopian clovers in wheat has potential under African highland conditions.

Merr.] and pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] to assess their suitability in terms of seed yield, land-equivalent ratio and competition ratio affecting the monetary advantages. 'JS 71-5' soybean intercropped with 'ICPL 8357' pigeonpea showed higher seed yield (1 327 kg/ha) and monetary advantage (Rs 3 314.19/ha) due to higher relative yield and land-equivalent ratio. 'PK 416' soybean - 'AS 71-37' pigeonpea gave maximum monetary advantage (Rs 3 414.99/ha) due to minimum competition between crop and higher crowding coefficient (Kb) of pigeonpea. Relative yield of intercrop had an adverse effect on soybean-pigeonpea yield compared with the sole crop and showed dominance of soybean over pigeonpea except 'PK 416' soybean + 'AS 71-37' pigeonpea combination. Land-equivalent ratio of the intercrop showed advantage in yield (1.052-1.406). 'JS 71-5' soybean was more competitive with 'AS 71-37' (0.812) and 'C 11' (0.731) pigeonpea and gave higher yield, as was expected. Aggressivity of intercrop suggested dominance of pigeonpea over soybean crop. Relative crowding coefficient indicated more non-competitive interference than competitive in all the intercropping combinations except 'PK 416' soybean with 'C 11' and 'ICPL 8357' pigeonpea.

The pod yield of groundnut decreased when intercropped with pigeon pea, the extent of the decline differing with groundnut and pigeon pea genotypes. The reduction in groundnut pod yield and the degree and duration of shading was less when grown with pigeon pea type ICPL87 than with LRG30. During the monsoon, pod yield among intercropped groundnut genotypes ranged between 47% and 88% of their yields under monocropping because of differences in growth pattern and duration (90-125 days). The groundnut type most suitable for intercropping had early vigour, early maturity and high partitioning and pod growth rate. However, variation in pod yield among groundnut genotypes was not observed during the winter season because they showed less variation in duration and growth and there was less shading by the associated pigeon pea.

The objective of this experiment was to assess how the productivity of intercrops was affected by the interaction of irrigation levels and mulches, compared to monocrops. Six-rowed barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was intercropped with lentil (Lens culinaris Medik) and flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) with two levels of irrigations [(i) zero and (ii) one irrigation applied 35 d after planting] and two levels of mulch [(i) no mulch and (ii) rice straw mulch at the rate of approximately 7 Mg/ha-1]. Monocrop of each species were also grown. Seed yield of the monocrops were higher than their intercrop yields. Intercropped barley yielded 73 to 81% of the yield to monoculture. Intercropped lentil yielded 30 to 34% of the yield of monoculture, whereas intercropped seed yield of flax ranged from 27 to 31% of monoculture. Yield increased from one application of irrigation ranged from 12 to 21% of zero irrigation. The increase in yield due to straw mulch was 11 to 17% higher over no mulch.

Complementarity and facilitation with respect to P acquisition do not drive overyielding by intercropping	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Intercropping; Complementarity and facilitation; Phosphorus; Root exudates"	"SOIL-PHOSPHORUS AVAILABILITY; INTERSPECIFIC INTERACTIONS; ROOT EXUDATION; MAIZE IMPROVES; RESOURCE USE; PLANT; PHOSPHATE; IRON; RHIZOSPHERE; EFFICIENCY"	Complementarity in phosphorus (P) acquisition from different sources and facilitation of P uptake have been implicated in yield advantages of intercropping. These beneficial interactions between crop species are expected to be particularly relevant on low-P soils. Millet and chickpea have previously been found to differ in their ability to access different chemically bound forms of P. Here, we conducted a two-year field experiment on a low-P soil with or without P fertilization to determine whether the resulting potential for complementarity and facilitation with respect to P acquisition is associated with increased P uptake and yield of an intercrop as compared to sole crops. Alkaline phosphatase activity and carboxylate concentration differed between millet and chickpea, indicating potential complementarity in access to different P sources. Comparison of aboveground P content in the intercrop and the pure stands showed a positive net effect for P uptake (NEP > 0) when no P fertilizer was applied, but this positive net effect for P acquisition was not associated with a yield increase (NEY = 0). When P fertilizer was applied, there was no significant net increase in P uptake by the intercrop compared to sole crops (NEP = 0), but there was a significant yield gain (NEY > 0). Species trait dissimilarities for P acquisition from different sources supported complementarity in, and facilitation of P uptake by millet and chickpea in the field on a low-P soil, but this did not result in yield increase. The finding does not support the notion that complementarity in P acquisition from different sources and facilitation of P uptake are key drivers for overyielding by intercropping on low-P soil.

MOENCH; DEFICIT IRRIGATION; LIGHT INTERCEPTION; RESOURCE CAPTURE; WATER-STRESS; MAIZE; YIELD; DROUGHT; GROWTH; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION"	The objective of intercropping is to improve resource efficiencies for land, water and radiation. Few studies have focused on the interactive effects of water stress on radiation use efficiency (RUE) in an intercrop system. The study determines the effect of intercropping sorghum with either cowpea or bottle gourd on RUE and biomass accumulation in response to water stress. This was assessed using a split-plot design with crop sequences sole sorghum, sole cowpea, and sole bottle gourd and intercrop systems sorghum-cowpea and sorghum-bottle gourd assigned as sub-plots arranged in randomised complete blocks within main plots, water regimes: full irrigation, deficit irrigation and rainfed. We quantified specific leaf area, leaf area index as well as biomass accumulation and partitioning. Extinction coefficient, intercepted photosynthetic active radiation (IPAR) and RUE for biomass (RUEb) and grain (RUEg) were also determined. Under rainfed conditions, intercropping with either cowpea (26%) or bottle gourd (62%) improved sorghum leaf area. A reduction in specific leaf area was observed for sorghum when it was intercropped with either cowpea (-20%) or bottle gourd (-19%). Under full irrigation, sorghum stems constituted a larger proportion (62%) of final biomass in comparison to sorghum under deficit irrigation (52%) and rainfed conditions (50%). Intercropping sorghum with either cowpea or bottle gourd improved IPAR (38%), RUEb (93%) and RUEg (11%) under rainfed conditions. This study showed that under water-limited conditions intercropping reduced sorghum stem mass and increased canopy size, radiation interception, and grain yield and improved RUE. In agreement with our proposition, water availability was closely associated with radiation use efficiency. Intercropping can be recommended for semi-arid environments since it improves RUE and sorghum biomass and grain yield. (c) 2018 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Intercropping is an alternative farming practice that promotes pest control without the use of chemical pesticides. Here, we develop a mathematical model to study epidemic spreading and control in intercropped agricultural fields as a sustainable pest management tool for agriculture. The model combines the movement of aphids transmitting a virus in an agricultural field, the spatial distribution of plants in the intercropped field and the presence of 'trap crops' in an epidemiological susceptible-infected-removed model. Using this model, we study several intercropping arrangements without and with trap crops and find a new intercropping arrangement that may improve significantly pest management in agricultural fields with respect to the commonly used intercrop systems.

The experimental design was a randomized complete block with 13 treatments replicated thrice. Significant (p 0.05) differences were observed in grain yield with 2:1 and 2:2 intercropping treatments. Legumes yield was significantly reduced when intercropped with baby corn. However, total productivity in terms of baby corn yield equivalent (7063 kg ha-1) was highest under the baby corn-groundnut intercropping system, and land use efficiency was higher under the intercropping system as compared with monocrops of either species. There was a significant increase in atmospheric nitrogen fixation by the legumes for the intercropping system over monocrops. Baby corn facilitated an increase in nodule number and dry weight in legumes under intercropping over monocrops; moreover, root length of legumes was greater when intercropped with baby corn. These findings suggest that intercropping baby corn and legumes, particularly groundnut, can increase total productivity per unit area, improve land use efficiency, and increase atmospheric nitrogen fixing ability."

Canopy Development of Annual Legumes and Forage Sorghum Intercrops and Its Relation to Dry Matter Accumulation	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							"MAIZE ZEA-MAYS; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; RADIATION INTERCEPTION; YIELD; MIXTURES; QUALITY; GROWTH; MODEL; CORN; NITROGEN"	Livestock production is an important agro-industry in many semiarid regions of the world including the southern High Plains, USA. Therefore, objectives of this study were to understand how canopy development and light interception patterns impact biomass yield of several legume species when inter-cropped with forage sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] grown under irrigation. Field studies were conducted at Tucumcari and Clovis, NM in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Five annual legumes [cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L.), lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus L.), lablab (Lablab purpureus L.), and pole bean (P. vulgaris L.)] were intercropped between two rows of sorghum spaced at 0.75 m and compared with sole sorghum under irrigation. Intercropping legumes with sorghum increased leaf area index (LAI) compared with sorghum alone, at both locations. Intercropping legumes with sorghum resulted in faster canopy coverage and greater light interception early in the growing season compared with sorghum alone. Lablab, cowpea, lima bean, and pole bean were promising legumes to improve light interception when intercropping with sorghum. The LAI was an accurate growth predictor of light interception in all intercropping systems and sorghum alone (R-2 > 0.94). Overall, optimum LAI (90% light interception) was lower in all intercropping systems compared with sorghum alone. Dry matter accumulation had strong correlations with LAI and light interception at both locations before canopy closure (58 d after planting). Overall, intercropping legumes in forage sorghum benefits producers by providing protein to livestock and reduces the need to purchase dietary supplements in their traditional livestock production systems.

Merrill] is a major grain-legume used in rotation with cereal crops throughout the world. However, little is known about the soybean-based crop rotations effects on potassium (K) efficiency and its cycling capacity in soil. Therefore, a field study was carried out over 2 years to assess K cycling and which soil depth contributes to K uptake in first soybean crop as well as in the following crop rotation within the same rainfed growing season. Four rotations were evaluated, including (1) soybean-fallow, (2) soybean-ruzigrass (Brachiaria ruziziensis), (3) soybean-corn (Zea mays L.), and (iv) soybean-intercrop (corn and ruzigrass). Rubidium (Rb) was used as a K tracer and applied at the depths of 0, 0.3, and 0.6 m. For soybean, 60% of the K was taken up from the shallow soil layer, whereas the depths of 0.3 and 0.6 m accounted for 25 and 15%, respectively. In the second crop, ruzigrass monoculture and intercrop enhanced K uptake (41-302 kg ha(-1)) relative to the corn monoculture, and most of the K originated from a soil depth of 0.3-0.6 m, with average values of 40 and 34%, respectively. The K cycled from soybean residue contributed between 1 and 13% of the total nutrient cycling. In the soybean crop, most of the K was taken up from the upper soil layer. The soybean-intercrop rotation was the best pathway for allying the benefits of high K-cycling grass with the production of a cash crop.

"Studies were conducted to examine the effect of legumes and oilseed crop strips on inter-cropping properties and yield related parameters during the Rabi season 2017-18 at three selected locations in Mithawan Hill Torrent (spate) irrigated fields of Dera Ghazi Khan Punjab-Pakistan. The experiment was laid out in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) having three replications. The sole strips of chickpea, arugula (locally called taramira), lentil were evaluated. Chickpea-arugula alternate strip, chickpea-lentil alternate strip, arugula-lentil alternate strip and chickpea-arugula-lentil alternate strip in combination were also investigated. Data was analyzed through ANOVA technique and differences among the treatments were tested using HSD Tukey's test. The obtained results shows that the Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) of sole chickpea was 0.97 and LER of strip intercropping was 1.79 which shows distinct advantage of strip intercropping. Relative Crowding Coefficient (RCC) value for chickpea, arugula and lentil were 25, 9.44 and 0.1, respectively when compared with the sole strip cropping. It shows that intercropping of chickpea and arugula were effective. Chickpea and arugula strip inter crop resulted in better LER and RCC with reasonable yield of both crops under the spate irrigated conditions of Mithawan hill torrent command area Dera Ghazi Khan Punjab (Pakistan). Area time equivalent ratio could not bring significant differences among the strip inter cropping treatments. Lentil could not succeed in strip inter cropping in spate irrigated situations of Mithawan hill torrent. The obtained results recorded maximum 1000 seed weight of chickpea (144.80 g) and arugula (4.72 g); seed yield of chickpea (800.16 kg ha(-1)), arugula (433.14 kg ha(-1)), respectively when both crops were grown in the form of separate sole strip. Hence for achieving maximum yield, the farmers of spate irrigated area of Mithawan hill torrent area should sow chickpea or arugula as a sole strip."

However, aquatic crops (e.g., rice) intercropping is relatively rare. Field experiments of two years/four seasons (early and late seasons in 2012, 2013) was carried out to test the effects of rice-water spinach intercropping on yield, disease and pest control, and Si, N nutrition of rice plant in the present study. The experiment contained three treatments including rice monoculture, water spinach monoculture and rice-water spinach intercropping with three replicates by randomized block design. Results showed that rice-water spinach intercropping significantly reduced the incidence of disease and pest of rice, with a reduction of rice sheath blight by 17.3%-50.6% and rice leaf folders by 5.1%-58.2%. For yield, intercropping resulted in an increase of rice yield by 45.1%-71.7% in early season and 20.9%-34.3% in late season, but a decrease of water spinach yield by 14.1%-37.1% in early season and 3.8%-18.3% in late season. However, rice-water spinach intercropping gave a higher land equivalent ratio (1.02-1.17) therefore improved land utilization efficiency. Furthermore, intercropping significantly increased Si concentration, Si and N absorption in rice leaves in ripening stage compared with rice monoculture. Our findings suggest that rice-water spinach intercropping exhibits yield advantage for rice or total yield, improves Si nutrition of rice and provides an environmentally sound approach in controlling disease and pest.

Persian clover, Trifolium resupinatum L., was selected as a companion plant in intercropping with tomato in our experiments, due to a key role in enhancing soil fertility and soil texture, attracting flower-visiting natural enemies by production of numerous flowers, and repelling insects by phenolic compounds secretion. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of intercropping tomato (T) and Persian clover (C) in the four patterns: 1 T: 2C, 2 T: 2C, 3 T: 2C and 4 T: 2C (row ratios) in comparison with sole tomato on the densities of TFB and natural enemies in tomato plantations during 2016 and 2017 growing seasons in Iran. Moreover, yields of both crops were measured to evaluate yield benefits of intercrops. Results indicated all intercropping patterns significantly reduced the density of TFB eggs and larvae compared with sole tomato in the two growing seasons. Lower densities of TFB eggs and larvae, among intercrops, were recorded in 1 T: 2C and 2 T: 2C in the two seasons. In 2016 and 2017 growing season, the average numbers of predatory bugs, coccinellids and Chrysoperla carnea (Stephans) were higher in intercrops than in sole tomato and their abundance, among intercrops, raised with increasing the proportion of clover/tomato rows. Moreover, the egg and larval parasitism rates were higher in intercrop plots than in the control plots. The highest value of land equivalent ratio (1.29 in 2016 and 1.30 in 2017) was found in 1 T: 2C among intercrop patterns in the two cropping seasons. Therefore, we could conclude that intercropping tomato and Persian clover, especially in 1 T:2C and 2 T:2C patterns are more profitable in TFB management programs.

Bioeconomic optimization of conservation agriculture production systems (CAPS) for smallholder tribal farmers in the hill region of Nepal	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						"conservation agriculture; economic benefits; hill region; multiobjective model; Nepal"	"CROPPING SYSTEMS; LAND MANAGEMENT; SOIL; TECHNOLOGIES; CULTIVATION; CONVERSION; MIDHILLS; ADOPTION; TILLAGE; IMPACTS"	"This research was conducted to determine the potential for the use of Conservation Agriculture Production Systems (CAPS) in the hill region of Nepal, an area highly prone to food insecurity and soil losses. Conservation agriculture (CA) includes the practices of tillage reduction, soil cover maintenance, and optimal crop rotation. Farming in Nepal consists of two main cropping seasons: rainy and postrainy. Therefore, the annual production system includes different CA practices suitable for each cropping season. Due to conflicting criteria for maximizing farm profits while minimizing soil losses from CA, this study used a dynamic multiobjective linear programming model with a 20-year horizon to predict the optimal solution. Seven systems combining varying tillage practices (full versus strip tillage), cropping patterns (sole versus intercropping), and four crops were used for analysis. The results showed the optimal CAPS as strip tillage of maize (Zea mays L.) followed by intercropping millet (Eleusine coracana) and legumes; however, there are some variations in net present value (NPV) of profits due to the length of the planning horizon and discount rates. For long planning horizons of 20 years, farmers' objectives would be optimized when all land is allocated to strip tillage systems by year 2. The results show that the economic gains from practicing strip tillage- based CA varies among villages, ranging from 29% to 110% using discount rates of 10% and 48% to 274% under lower/social discount rate of 3%. In addition to profit, adoption of a CA system reduces the amount of soil loss by 83% to 88% over 20 years. Despite long-term benefits from CA, the short-term differences in the economic returns from CAPS are not enough for farmers to abandon their traditional practices. Therefore, from a societal welfare standpoint, it is recommended that the government provide short-term financial support to pay for the environmental services provided by the CAPS, and that CAPS education and training be made available to farmers. Additionally, long-term research to develop locally adapted CA practices may be necessary to fully realize the benefits for smallholder farmers."

AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"soil pH; acidification; sulphur; powdery mildew; cashew"		"Cashew nut, a major cash crop of Tanzania, is mainly produced in the South Eastern part of the country. Sulphur dust is widely used for controlling powdery mildew disease caused by Oidium anacardii Noack. This can cause acidification of soils and thus, may threaten the productivity of cashew and its intercrops. To assess the extent and magnitude of the current acidification, pH of topsoil (0-20 cm) and subsoil (20-40 cm) of 70 farmers' cashew groves where sulphur had been applied for up to 12 years, was compared to 70 similar undusted groves. On average topsoil pH of sulphur dusted groves on the Makonde plateau was 0.2 U lower than of undusted groves; subsoil pH was 0.1 U lower. However, in 29% of the groves the difference in topsoil pH between dusted and undusted groves was between 0.5 and 0.9 U. For groves of the inland plains, no effect could be established. Soil pH on the Makonde plateau decreased with increasing number of years of sulphur use while it remained stable in the inland plains. Soils of the Makonde plateau have a high risk for acidifying to pH levels between 4.5 and 4.0 which could affect the cashew nut production and would be detrimental to intercrops such as sorghum, finger millet, and maize. This is due to the soils' inherently low pH and low buffering capacity which is linked to their high sand content. Lime could be used to mitigate the effect of sulphur and can be obtained locally from fossil coral limestone, not exploited yet. Alternatively, the incidence of powdery mildew could be reduced by crop husbandry techniques or by using organic fungicides; the first alternative has the disadvantage of requiring farmers to understand aspects of the epidemiology, the second of being more costly and more toxic than sulphur and of requiring water for its application which is scarce on the Makonde plateau.

Damaged, and in some cases, intact plants may also produce volatile signals that warn other plants of impending attack. Some of these intact plants are used as intercrops in 'push-pull' strategies; cropping systems based on stimulo-deterrent principle, where the target crop is intercropped with herbivore repellent plants (push) while attractant plants (pull) are planted around this intercrop. The intercrop, in addition to repelling the herbivores, attracts and conserves natural enemies thereby ensuring continued suppression of the pests. This natural delivery of semiochemicals for CBC is currently being exploited by smallholder farmers in eastern Africa in the management of cereal stemborers in maize and sorghum. Synthetic HIPVs also have the potential to effectively recruit natural enemies, thereby improving CBC as has been demonstrated in a series of field experiments in vineyards and hop yards in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Potentially, plants could be 'turned on' by synthetic HIPV signals, and therefore become sources of natural enemy-recruiting volatiles. With the rapid development of plant molecular biology, modification of secondary plant metabolism is also possible which could allow appropriate semiochemicals to be generated by plants at certain growth stages. By identifying the promoter sequences associated with external plant signals that induce biochemical pathways, plant defense genes could be 'switched on' prior to insect attack. We review recent research on 'push-pull' strategies and synthetic HIPVs in recruitment of beneficial arthropods and warding off pest attack. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

J	"Gossen, BD; McDonald, MR"				"Gossen, Bruce D.; McDonald, Mary Ruth"			New technologies could enhance natural biological control and disease management and reduce reliance on synthetic pesticides	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Review						"autonomous vehicles; biological control; ecosystem services; gene editing; marker-assisted selection; remote sensing; RNAi; synthetic pesticides"	"PLASMODIOPHORA-BRASSICAE; RESTING SPORES; CROPPING SYSTEMS; CLUBROOT; FUNGICIDE; ROTATION; FIELD; SOIL; PEA"	A shift to larger farms, bigger equipment and reduced crop diversity has been occurring in North American agriculture for many years. This has resulted in an increased reliance on genetic resistance and pesticides because much of the pest reduction from natural biological control (ecosystem services) associated with crop rotation and biological diversity has been lost. This shift has contributed to erosion of cultivar resistance and loss of sensitivity to pesticides. However, the impending change to autonomous field equipment represents an opportunity to reverse the trend towards ever-larger farm equipment. Small autonomous units have the potential to make intercropping, deployment of multi-lines, precision agriculture and even crop rotation, easier and more cost-effective. Remote sensing using drones, combined with precision application of pesticides and improved weather forecasts to help select optimum conditions, could improve the efficacy of both biocontrol agents and synthetic pesticides. Similarly, technologies such as marker-assisted selection for complex traits, gene editing to provide novel sources of resistance, and RNAi (gene silencing) to manage target pest populations could reduce reliance on synthetic pesticides. Crop rotation and improved strategies for deploying genetic resistance, combined with smaller fields, improved scouting and optimized pesticide application, could shift the balance back towards biological diversity and natural biological control within fields. Adding improved genetics for resistance to this mix could further reduce the need for large-scale pesticide application, and minimize both the use and impact of synthetic pesticides in agricultural systems.

Relay cropping of cotton in wheat improves productivity of cotton-wheat cropping system	PLOS ONE			English	Article							"TRITICUM-AESTIVUM L.; ECONOMIC RETURNS; YIELD COMPONENTS; FIBER QUALITY; PROFITABILITY; FERTILIZATION; GROWTH; PUNJAB; SEASON; MAIZE"	"Cotton-wheat (CW) is an important cropping system in Pakistan; however, delayed cultivation of cotton after wheat significantly deceases system productivity. Late-sown cotton crop suffers from heat stress, high fruit shedding and infestation of various pests and cotton leaf curl virus (CLCV). Therefore, early sowing of cotton is preferred to overcome these challenges. However, cotton planting is overlapped with the harvesting of wheat crop in CW cropping system. Since fallow land is unavailable, relay intercropping of cotton in wheat crop seems a viable option for early planting. This three-year field study evaluated the role of relay cropping of cotton in improving the productivity of CW cropping system and lowering CLCV infestation. Wheat was planted in 22.5 cm rows with no row skipped (W-1), one row skipped after every three (W-2), and six rows (W-3) for planting cotton in 0.75 and 1.50 m apart rows. Early cotton was planted in fallow land (C-1) and standing wheat in 0.75 (C-2) and 1.50 m (C-3) apart rows and conventional planting after wheat harvesting (C-4). Yield losses of wheat crop ranged from 8.16 to 19.81% in W-3 and W-2, respectively compared W-1. However, C-2 and C-3 treatments improved cotton yield by 86.07% and 64.89% suppressed CLCV infestation by 68.14% and 65.86%, respectively compared to C-4. Moreover, net benefits from relay cropping (W2C2) were 2190.1 $ ha(-1) in 2013-14, 1954.4 $ ha(-1) in 2014-15 and 2559.5 $ ha(-1) in 2015-16 in comparison with C-1 (1543.5, 1311.7 and 1892.3 $ ha(-1) during 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16, respectively). The W-2 resulted in higher cotton yield compared to W-3 which is mainly attributed to double number of cotton rows in W-2 than W-3. It is concluded that cotton relay cropping (W2C2) resulted in the highest economic returns with minimum CLCV infestation. Therefore, W2C2 is recommended for improving the system productivity of CW cropping system."

A split-plot experimental design for the planting pattern (sole proso millet (SP) and proso millet/mung bean intercropping (PM)) and N fertilizer application rate (N0, 0 kg N ha(-1); N60, 60 kg N ha(-1); N120, 120 kg N ha(-1); and N180, 180 kg N ha(-1) for proso millet) was used. Results showed that intercropping combined with N fertilization enhanced the leaf photosynthetic efficiency of proso millet by facilitating stomatal opening, and such improvements were conducive to increasing the maximal quantum yield of PSII photochemistry and the photochemical quenching coefficient. Specifically, intercropping combined with the N120 treatment was an efficient farming practice that increased radiation use efficiency by 18.1 % and 17.9 %, water use efficiency by 60.2 % and 61.8 %, and N uptake by 96.0 % and 71.6 % in 2018 and 2019, respectively, compared with those parameters in the N0 treatment in the sole planting system. Similar improvements were observed for grain yield, which reached maximum values at N120 (6331.8 kg ha(-1) and 6531.3 kg ha(-1) in 2018 and 2019, respectively) in the PM treatment. These responses resulted in an increased harvest index and land equivalent ratio. Consequently, intercropping combined with moderate N inputs reduces the chemical fertilizer application rate and increases crop productivity and is considered to be a reasonable strategy for field management."

Yield and evapotranspiration characteristics of potato-legume intercropping simulated using a dual coefficient approach in a tropical highland	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Intercropping; Dual crop coefficient; Soil water balance; Evapotranspiration; Potato"	"SOLANUM-TUBEROSUM-L.; MODELING WATER-USE; CROP COEFFICIENT; ESTIMATING EVAPORATION; SOIL EVAPORATION; IRRIGATION WATER; TRANSPIRATION; ROOT; PRODUCTIVITY; MAIZE"	An accurate estimation of crop evapotranspiration and soil water balance under potato-legume intercropping is important for improving the crop water productivity of rainfed potato. This study quantified the evapotranspiration, yield, and soil water balance of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) intercropped with lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus L.) or dolichos (Lablab purpureus L.) in comparison to the same crops under monocropping. The experiment was set up in three agroecological zones of Kenya: upper midland (with an altitude range of 1500-1653 m above sea level (masl)), lower highland (1892-1923 masl) and upper highland (2502-2594 masl). The dual crop coefficient approach was adopted with the SIMDualKc model to estimate crop evapotranspiration and compute the soil water balance. The dual crop coefficient partitions crop evapotranspiration into crop transpiration and soil evaporation by applying both soil evaporation and basal crop coefficient. The model was calibrated and validated using field data observed along four crop growth seasons. The basal crop coefficients, the ratios of soil evaporation to evapotranspiration, and that of transpiration to evapotranspiration were determined. The yields of different intercrops were converted into equivalent yield of potato based on price of the produce. Good agreement between the observed and simulated data for available soil water and crop evapotranspiration was found with modeling efficiency > 0.8. The residual mean square error was low and ranged from 0.01-0.08 m3 m3 for available soil water and 0.03-0.09 mm d-1 for crop evapotranspiration. The transpiration to actual evapotranspiration ratio of potato-legume intercropping was 6-28% greater than that of the sole potato because legume intercrops fully covered the ground by mid-season, thus limiting the energy available for soil evaporation. Crop yields were significantly greater under intercropping as transpiration occurred near its potential rate, thus not limiting yields. These results support the dual crop coefficient method as an appropriate tool to estimate and accurately partition crop evapotranspiration under potato-legume intercropping.

A field experiment was conducted in 2015 and 2016, to examine the biological and economic viability of two intercropping systems (potato-dolichos and potato-bean planted in two potatoes to legume population density ratios: 1.1:2 and 1: 2.4) and their corresponding pure stands. Intercropping systems were also evaluated based on five competition indices: relative crowding coefficient (K), aggressivity (A), competitive ratio (CR), intercropping advantage (IA) and actual yield loss (AYL). Although biological feasibility revealed that intercropping decreased the yield of intercrops compared with respective monocultures; the economic assessment of different cropping systems indicated that intercropping resulted in a higher remuneration (gross and net income) than pure stands. Intercropping potato with a high population of legume (in 1: 2.4 patterns), resulted in not only higher system productivity but also potato equivalent yield compared to 1.1:2. Intercropping proved to be advantageous with AYL decreasing with increasing proportion of the legumes, whereas IA increased as the population of legumes increased. With regard to competition between the intercrops, the potato was more aggressive (A of potato was positive, and its CR > 1) in all cropping systems, and it dominated over legume (that had negative A values and CR < 1). Aggressivity and dominance capacity was higher in 1: 2.4 than 1.1:2 series. These results suggest that potato-legume intercropping may provide viable intensification options, especially for smallholder farmers."

The most common advantage of intercropping is the production of greater yield on a given piece of land by making more efficient use of the available growth resources using a mixture of crops of different rooting ability, canopy structure, height, and nutrient requirements based on the complementary utilization of growth resources by the component crops. Moreover, intercropping improves soil fertility through biological nitrogen fixation with the use of legumes, increases soil conservation through greater ground cover than sole cropping, and provides better lodging resistance for crops susceptible to lodging than when grown in monoculture. Intercrops often reduce pest incidence and improve forage quality by increasing crude protein yield of forage. Intercropping provides insurance against crop failure or against unstable market prices for a given commodity, especially in areas subject to extreme weather conditions such as frost, drought, and flood. Thus, it offers greater financial stability than sole cropping, which makes the system particularly suitable for labor-intensive small farms. Besides, intercropping allows lower inputs through reduced fertilizer and pesticide requirements, thus minimizing environmental impacts of agriculture. However, intercropping has some disadvantages such as the selection of the appropriate crop species and the appropriate sowing densities, including extra work in preparing and planting the seed mixture and also extra work during crop management practices, including harvest. The selection of an appropriate intercropping system for each case is quite complex as the success of intercropping systems depend much on the interactions between the component species, the available management practices, and the environmental conditions. Plant breeding can contribute determinedly to increase of productivity of intercropping systems by investigating and exploiting the genetic variability to intercrop adaptation. This paper provides an overall view and evaluation of annual intercropping, summarizing its main advantages supported by a number of key examples from the literature which point out its great value in the context of sustainable agriculture.

Grain yield of corn at different population densities and intercropped with forages	REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL			English	Article						"no-tillage system; crop-livestock integration; crop rotation"	"NO-TILLAGE; SUCCESSION; PASTURE; MAIZE"	The no-tillage system optimizes agricultural areas, maintaining the supply of straw and promoting crop rotation and soil conservation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate sowing quality and grain yield of corn intercropped with three forage species of the Urochloa genus associated with two corn population densities. The experiment was conducted at the Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), in Jaboticabal-SP, Brazil. The experimental design was randomized blocks in a 2 x 3 factorial scheme with four replicates. The treatments consisted of two corn densities (55,000 and 75,000 plants ha(-1)) intercropped with three forages (Urochloa brizantha, Urochloa decumbens and Urochloa ruziziensis) sown between rows of corn in the V4 stage. The following corn variables were analysed: mean number of days for emergence, longitudinal distribution, grain yield, initial population and final population. There were differences between corn populations (p < 0.1) and the intercropping of corn with the species U. brizantha and U. ruziziensis promoted the best results, which permitted concluding that the cultivation of corn at the population density of 75,000 plants ha(-1) intercropped U. brizantha and U. ruziziensis promoted better sowing quality and, consequently, higher grain yields.

Multi/intercropping allows growers to increase the yields and profits per unit area by producing multiple crops on the same beds. Experiments determining the effects of intercropping and plant spacing was conducted in Fall 2018 and 2019 at Gulf Coast Research and Education Center, Balm. Tomato and bell pepper were intercropped at low and high planting density on plastic-covered beds. Bell pepper shoot biomass was significantly (P < 0.001) reduced when intercropped with tomato, compared with monocropped bell pepper. However, tomato shoot biomass was significantly reduced when tomato plant density increased, but it was unaffected by bell pepper intercropping. Biomass of both crops was unaffected by relay cropping. Bell pepper yields when intercropped with tomato at low density (60 cm tomato-tomato and 38 cm pepper-pepper) had similar yields to bell pepper planted alone in low and high planting density. We concluded that bell pepper plants were more sensitive to interspecific competition, whereas tomato plants were more sensitive to intraspecific competition. Intercropping may be a viable option for growers at recommended plant densities used for monocrops. However, high plant density is not recommended.

DC.) when monocropped or intercropped with carrot (Daucus carota L.) under the growing conditions in Dourados-MS, Brazil. Treatments were arranged in a randomised block design with four replications. The characteristics evaluated were the fresh weights (FWs) and dry weights (DWs) of whole plants and inflorescences of marcela, and the FW of marketable and non-marketable carrot roots and the FWs of carrot leaves. Also evaluated were the concentrations of phenolic compounds and flavonoids present in the inflorescences of marcela. The efficiency of intercropping was evaluated using the equivalent area index (EAI) which indicates the area of land required in a monoculture to produce the same yield as 1.0 ha of polyculture using the same plant population with the same management practices. For marcela, higher levels of inflorescence production, phenolic compounds and flavonoids were confirmed by intercropping. There were no significant differences in the characteristics of carrot among the planting arrangements. The EAI for the marcela-carrot intercropped system was 2.95. Therefore, intercropping was considered more effective than a monoculture.	"[Mota, J. H.; Soares, T. S.] Univ Fed Goias, BR-75801615 Jatai, Go, Brazil; [Cardos, C. A.

Intercropping of climbing bean (Phaseolus vulgaris, L.) and East African highland banana (Musa spp.) in the Ugandan highlands	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article						"Systems agronomy; legumes; East Africa"	"FERTILIZER; ABILITY; SYSTEM; MAIZE; YIELD"	East African highland bananas and climbing beans are important crops for food and income in the highlands of Uganda. Intercropping of banana with legume crops is a common practice, yet climbing bean intercropping with perennials has rarely been studied in Uganda. To understand how best to improve the production system, we assessed the effects of pruning of banana leaves on light availability for climbing beans, resulting effects on bean yields and potential differences in shade tolerance between two climbing bean varieties in the eastern and southwestern highlands of Uganda. Measurements of the transmission of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) through the banana canopy were combined with yield measurements of a local and improved climbing bean variety and with banana pseudostem girth in two seasons (2016A and 2016B). We also compared yields of intercropped with sole-cropped climbing beans. The mean fractions of PAR transmitted through the banana canopy - hence available for beans - were 0.43 on pruned and 0.38 on non-pruned subplots, a significant 15% difference. The improved light availability did not increase climbing bean yield. Although no direct relationship between light interception and bean yields was found, bean yields on the most and least shaded parts of the intercropped fields differed significantly, suggesting that beans do benefit from improved light availability in intercropping. Generally, yields of sole-cropped beans were significantly larger than of intercropped beans, but we could not single out the effects of competition for light, water, and/or nutrients. The bean varieties responded similarly to the pruning treatments. The local variety tended to perform relatively better in intercropping, the improved variety in sole cropping, though differences were not significant overall. Pruning and retention of eight banana leaves over the course of a season did not affect banana pseudostem girths in the mature banana plantations. Although light availability improved, farmers may not expect a major effect on bean yield. Future research may focus on the effects of a lower number of leaves retained, comparing a number of bean varieties for suitability in sole or intercropping, or on other factors influencing the relation between the two crops such as relative plant densities of beans and bananas.

While complementarity between species is a potentially important mechanism underlying mixture benefits, there is little quantitative evidence about complementarity of root growth. Therefore, we aimed to gain detailed knowledge about mixture effects of specific root traits. Methods Blue lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) and winter rye (Secale cereale L.) were grown as sole and intercrops in a two-year organically managed field experiment in Germany. Crops were analysed for shoot biomass and nutrient uptake as well as for root mass density (RMD), root length density (RLD) and specific root length (SRL). We used Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to discriminate the root mass species-specifically in the mixtures. Results In the shoot, overyielding was only found for N and P uptake in the 75:25 mixture of lupin and rye, whereas positive mixture effects of RLD, RMD, and root mass complementarity occurred only in the 50:50 mixture in one year. Consistently positive mixture effects of SRL were found. Root biomass proportion of rye was higher in topsoil, that of lupin higher in subsoil. Vertical niche differentiation in RMD between sole crops and mixtures was not observed. Conclusion Among all root traits analysed, consistent mixture effects were observed only for SRL. Mechanisms behind mixture effects of root traits need further research. FTIR spectroscopy discriminated intercrop root mass well. Discrimination of mixture partners' root length would help to better understand complementarity of root growth in mixtures.

Shade-tolerance of cultivar is very important in intercropping. The objective of this study was to understand light acclimation of different soybean cultivars grown under different shade treatments and why the photosynthetic capacity of soybean decreased in shade. The chlorophyll content (Chl a, Chl b, and Chl a+b), apparent quantum efficiency (AQE), the value of electrons produced per photon (alpha), maximal quantum yield of primary photochemistry (phi (Po)), quantum yield for electron transport (phi (Eo)), efficiency/probability that an electron moves further than Q(A) (-) (psi (Eo)), and performance index on the absorption basis (PIABS) of shade treatment increased significantly, while efficiency/probability with which an electron from the intersystem electron carriers is transferred to reduce end electron acceptors at the PSI acceptor side (delta (Ro)), quantum yield for reduction in end electron acceptors at the PSI acceptor side (phi (Ro)), total PI, measuring the performance up to the PSI end electron acceptors (PItotal) dropped significantly. The chlorophyll content, AQE, alpha, phi (Po), phi (Eo), psi (Eo) and PIABS of cultivar L32 were higher than those of L29. These results showed that shade increased the light-intercepting and utilization ratio to low light and the activity of PSII of soybean plants, but the energy transport from PSII to PSI was blocked, which was the reason why the photosynthetic capacity was inhibited. Shade-tolerant cultivar L32 had higher PSII activity and energy transport from PSII to PSI than L29 in shade, so shade-tolerant cultivar exhibited higher photosynthetic capacity and yield than shade-sensitive in shade.

However, in cotton strip intercropped with wheat, only limited knowledge on yield response to plant density and plant growth regulator i.e. mepiquat chloride (MC) exists. Here we quantified MC and plant density effects on cotton yield components and quality in wheat-cotton relay intercropping by three field experiments in 2010-2012 in Anyang, China. Four plant densities and four MC treatments were applied in different times and dosages. Lint yield significantly increased 40.7% when plant density increased from 3.0 to 7.5 plants m(-2), and enhanced 7.9% by applying MC four times compared to MC free control. High densities increased the number of bolls per m(2) but decreased single boll weight. Conversely, applying MC generally slightly decreased number of bolls, with the exception of a significant increase by applying MC four times, and increased boll weight. Lint percentage was decreased by applying MC. The yearly climate significantly impacted the effects of applying MC and plant density. Application of MC did not significantly affect cotton fiber length and micronaire, but increased fiber strength. Applying MC in combination with increasing plant density led to harvestable bolls to be located more at low and middle positions on the plant. The increase of boll weight by applying MC was partly resulted from the optimal distribution of harvestable bolls within the canopy. The results help farmers to optimize plant density and MC application in the intercropped cotton. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						"pendimethalin; pretilachlor; intercropping; weed control; herbicides; costs"	"GREEN MANURES; YIELD; WATER; WHEAT; SOIL"	This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of intercropping Sesbania with dry-seeded rice up to its vegetative phase (Sesbania), mulching with wheat residue (mulch) and herbicides for managing weeds and optimising the yield of dry-seeded rice. The density of grass weeds was lower with the mulch at all stages of crop growth. Though the dry weight of grass weeds at 30 days after seeding (DAS) was lower with Sesbania than with mulch, they were similar at later stages. A lower broadleaved weed density and dry weight were observed with Sesbania than with the mulch. It is concluded that application of wheat residue mulch at 4 t ha(-1) and Sesbania intercropping for 30 days were equally effective in controlling weeds associated with dry-seeded rice. However, pendimethalin (1000 g a.i. ha(-1)) or pretilachlor with safener (500 g a.i. ha(-1)) as pre-emergence applications followed by one hand-weeding were effective in controlling weeds, increasing grain yield of dry-seeded rice, and resulting in higher net returns than the weed-free treatment.

J	Ebbisa, A				Ebbisa, Addisu			Mechanisms underlying cereal/legume intercropping as nature-based biofortification: A review	FOOD PRODUCTION PROCESSING AND NUTRITION			English	Review						"Biofortification; Intercropping; Micronutrients; Hidden hunger; Bioavailability"	"NUTRIENT USE EFFICIENCY; ZEA-MAYS L.; ZINC BIOFORTIFICATION; RHIZOSPHERE PROCESSES; CROP PRODUCTIVITY; PLANT NUTRITION; IRON NUTRITION; MAIZE; PHOSPHORUS; SOIL"	"The deficiencies of micronutrients known as hidden hunger are severely affecting more than one-half of the world's population, which is highly related to low bioavailability of micronutrients, poor quality diets, and consumption of cereal-based foods in developing countries. Although numerous experiments proved biofortification as a paramount approach for improving hidden hunger around the world, its effectiveness is highly related to various soil factors, climate conditions, and the adoption rates of biofortified crops. Furthermore, agronomic biofortification may result in the sedimentation of heavy metals in the soil that pose another detrimental effect on plants and human health. In response to these challenges, several studies suggested intercropping as one of the feasible, eco-friendly, low-cost, and short-term approaches for improving the nutritional quality and yield of crops sustainable way. Besides, it is the cornerstone of climate-smart agriculture and the holistic solution for the most vulnerable area to solve malnutrition that disturbs human healthy catastrophically. Nevertheless, there is meager information on mechanisms and processes related to soil-plant interspecific interactions that lead to an increment of nutrients bioavailability to tackle the crisis of micronutrient deficiency in a nature-based solution. In this regard, this review tempted to (1) explore mechanisms and processes that can favor the bioavailability of Zn, Fe, P, etc. in soil and edible parts of crops, (2) synthesize available information on the benefits and synergic role of the intercropping system in food and nutritional security, and (3) outline the bottlenecks influencing the effectiveness of biofortification for promoting sustainable agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Based on this review SSA countries are malnourished due to limited access to diverse diets, supplementation, and commercially fortified food; hence, I suggest integrated research by agronomists, plant nutritionists, and agroecologist to intensify and utilize intercropping systems as biofortification sustainably alleviating micronutrient deficiencies."

The vegetables were planted sole and in mixtures with three cassava cultivars: Idileru, Odongbo and TMS30572. Intercropping reduced weed dry weight and soil temperature but increased soil moisture content, light interception and number of earthworm casts. Cassava/pumpkin intercrop increased soil moisture content, light interception and number of earthworm casts but reduced soil temperatures and weed dry weight compared with cassava/okra and cassava/pepper intercrops. Vegetative characters and fruit yields of okra, pepper and pumpkin were not affected by intercropping. Leaf area index (LAI) of intercropped cassava with pumpkin was reduced but not with okra and pepper. Land equivalent ratio was higher in cassava/okra and cassava/pepper than in cassava/pumpkin intercrop. Cassava/vegetable intercrop is a viable cropping option for high productivity and provision of suitable microenvironment for growth. A short, early-maturing cassava cultivar with a moderate LAI is better adapted in mixture with vegetables.	"[Salau, A. W.; Olasantan, F. O.; Bodunde, J. G.; Makinde, E.

However, as the N availability of organic fertilizers is difficult to calculate, applied fertilizer N may be subject to loss, particularly through leaching. The objective of this study was to evaluate the fate of fertilizer N from two common organic manures (chicken manure, mushroom compost) in arable topsoil during one winter cover cropping and cropping season. For this purpose, N-15-labelled fertilizers were produced by feeding chicken with N-15-labelled maize pellets and by incubating a mushroom substrate with N-15-labelled mineral fertilizer, respectively. Thereafter, the N-15 uptake by a mustard winter cover crop, its release to the main crop (sugar beet), and its retention in soil were investigated in two differently textured soils under otherwise identical conditions during a period of 400 days. Mineral (KNO3)-N-15 fertilizer served as control. In the surface soil (0-10 cm), only 20-40% of the applied N-15 was recovered after the first 50-60 days, which was the period of mustard growth. Thereafter, the amount of N-15 recovered in the soil increased again until day 259, reflecting the re-release of the fertilizer N from the winter cover crop in all treatments. The fertilizer N recovery in the winter cover crop itself was highest for mushroom compost (60%), followed by mineral fertilizer (50%) whereas it was almost not detectable for chicken manure (3%). Soil texture did not affect the overall retention of the fertilizer N in soil, and even after 400 days we recovered 67% of the fertilizer N from mushroom compost, 37% from chicken manure and 28% from the mineral fertilizer (0-30 cm). The following main crop, sugar beet, still utilized between 7 and 13% of the initial fertilizer addition from the previous summer. We conclude that mustard winter cover cropping after organic fertilization is efficient in retaining available N during wintertime, and mushroom compost is better than mineral N-fertilizer and chicken manure in respect of being a slow and sustainable N fertilizer source for the plants at reduced N losses.

Moench] and pigeonpeas [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.]. Intercropping gave a significant advantage over sole cropping in terms of dry matter production and grain yield, as calculated on the basis of the land equivalent ratio and area-time equivalent ratio. The N fertilizer use efficiency and atmospheric N2 fixation by pigeonpea were estimated using N-15-labeling and natural abundance methods. The N fertilizer use efficiency of sorghum was unaltered by the cropping system, while that of the pigeonpea was greatly reduced by intercropping. Although intercropping increased the fractional contribution of fixed N to the pigeonpeas, no significant difference was observed between the cropping systems in total symbiotically fixed N. There was no evidence of a significant transfer of N, from the pigeonpea to the sorghum. This study showed that use of soil N and fertilizer N by pigeonpeas was almost the same as that by sorghum in sole cropping, indicating the potential competence of pigeonpeas to exploit soil N. However, when N was exhausted by a companion crop in intercropping, the pigeonpea crop increased its dependency on atmospheric N2 fixation. We conclude that knowledge of how N from different sources is shared by companion crops is a pre-requisite to establishing strategies to increase N use, and consequently land productivity, in intercropping systems.

J	"Raseduzzaman, M; Jensen, ES"				"Raseduzzaman, Md.; Jensen, Erik Steen"			Does intercropping enhance yield stability in arable crop production ? A meta-analysis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"Intercropping; Yield stability; Intercropping design; Meta-analysis; Food security; Climate change"	"MAIZE ZEA-MAYS; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; WEED SUPPRESSION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; N-2 FIXATION; INORGANIC N; WATER-USE; SYSTEMS; COWPEA"	The adverse effects of climate change are significantly decreasing yield levels and yield stability over time in current monocropping systems. Intercropping (IC), i.e. growing more than one species simultaneously in the same field, often increases resource use efficiency and agricultural productivity compared with growing the component crops solely and can enhance yield stability. This meta-analysis of published IC literature quantified and analysed yield stability in IC compared with the respective sole crops, focusing on the effect of intercrop components (e.g. cereal-grain legume, non-cereal-grain legume), experimental patterns (e.g. experiment over years, experiment over locations), IC design (e.g. additive and replacement) and climatic zone (e.g. tropical, subtropical, and temperate). In total, 33 articles were analysed. The coefficient of variation (%CV) of yields was used for assessing yield stability, with lower CV value indicating higher yield stability. The analysis showed that cereal-grain legume IC (CV = 22.1) significantly increased yield stability compared with the respective grain legume sole crops (CV = 31.7). Moreover, compared with the respective cereal and legume sole crops, IC in the cereal-grain legume systems gave higher yield stability than IC in the non-cereal-grain legume systems. Compared with the respective cereal (CV = 25.3) and legume (CV = 30.3) sole crops, IC (CV = 19.1) in a replacement design had significantly (P < 0.05) higher yield stability. Also intercropping in replacement design gave more stable yields than IC in an additive design. In tropical regions, cereal sole crops (CV = 26.3) showed lower yield stability than IC (CV = 17.7) and legume sole crops (CV = 21.7). However, IC in all climatic zones showed higher yield stability than both sole crops. Moreover in our analysis, it was found that a higher yield level provided higher yield stability in crop production. Thus, increasing crop diversification through IC of cereals and grain legumes can enhance yield stability and food security, making an important contribution to eco-functional, ecological or sustainable intensification of global food production.

Nitrogen fertilization increased nutrient accumulation in surface mulch in all cropping systems. Regardless of cropping system, N rates, or growing season, palisade and guinea grass provided an adequate plant biomass production, soil cover throughout the year, soybean nutrient use efficiency, and soil quality.

Wilczek) in western India	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH			English	Article						"deep tillage; soil physical parameters; crop yields; sorghum equivalent yield"	"SOIL PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; YIELD; CONSERVATION; MAIZE"	The effects of deep tillage on soil properties and crop yields under rainfed agriculture were evaluated on a shallow calcareous sandy loam (Ustochrept) in Bhilwara region in Western India. Disc and chisel ploughing (deep tillage, 25 to 40 cm) were compared with conventional, minimum and zero tillage (shallow tillage, 0 to 12.5 cm) under rainfed agriculture for two consecutive years, 1989 and 1990. Deep tillage operations were superior to shallow tillage treatments. Disc and chisel ploughing significantly reduced the bulk density and increased soil porosity, hydraulic conductivity and equilibrium infiltration rate. The average value of these parameters in the top 15 cm of soil for minimum tillage compared with deep tillage were 1.41 and 1.37 Mg m(-3) 46.9 and 47.71 m(3) 100 m(-3), 1.51 and 1.78 cm h(-1) and 9.1 and 14.39 cm h(-1), respectively. These improvements have enhanced the profile soil moisture content. Over two years, the pooled differences in profile soil moisture content between deep tillage and zero tillage treatments were 0.74 cm at sowing and 1.09 cm at harvest. Yields of sorghum, green gram and sorghum equivalent under the intercropping system were significantly increased as a result of deep tillage by 12.4, 15.3 and 12.5%, respectively.

In these experiments, corn was intercropped with three beans-lablab bean [Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet], velvet bean [Mucuna pruriens (L.) D.C.], and scarlet runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus L.)-or grown in monoculture near Arlington and Lancaster, WI. Corn was sown in early May and late April in 2004 and 2005, respectively, and later thinned to 55,000 (low density) or 82,500 (normal density) plants ha(-1). Beans were sown in rows 8 cm on one side of the corn rows at 82,500 plants ha(-1) 2 or 4 wk after corn planting. Averaged over four environments, mixture forage dry matter (DM) yields were similar. However the velvet bean and scarlet runner bean mixtures produced significantly higher forage DM yield, 1.2 Mg ha(-1) and 0.89 Mg ha(-1) more, respectively, in the late bean planting treatment. Beans, except scarlet runner bean, which was damaged by mold and insects, increased the CP concentration of all mixtures, with the greatest increases from the lablab bean (13%) and velvet bean (16%). The experiments show that lablab bean grown with corn has the greatest potential of the three beans to increase CP concentration above monoculture corn, without compromising forage yield or calculated milk ha(-1) and increasing forage nutrient value.

Among the crops used for intercropping are corn and grasses. However, nitrogen can interfere with the production capacity of these plants. The objective of this study was to evaluate the macronutrient accumulations and efficiency values of out-of-season corn and Congo grass intercropped under a no-tillage system as a function of the nitrogen fertilisation applied by side dressing. The experimental design was a randomised complete block with four replicates of four nitrogen application rates: 0, 30, 60 and 90 kg ha(-1). The evaluations were carried out when the corn was physiologically mature. The phosphorus and potassium accumulation and nitrogen utilisation efficiency of the out-of-season corn did not respond to the nitrogen rates. The nitrogen recovery efficiency and the nitrogen to biomass conversion efficiency of the Congo grass also did not respond to nitrogen application rates. Nitrogen fertilisation as side dressing in the rows of the out-of-season corn and Congo grass intercropping improves the nutrient cycling in the no-tillage system. Side dressing fertilisation with nitrogen improves the agronomic efficiency and physiological efficiency of the out-of-season corn and Congo grass intercropping under a no-tillage system.

However, the potential contribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal hyphal networks is still poorly understood. The purpose of this work was to resolve the changes of AM fungal propagation and colonization in the pepper/corn intercropping systems due to the constitution of hyphal networks and the networks' effects on plant nutrient uptake and interspecific competitive relations. Materials and methods An 18-week pot experiment on an unsterilized soil was carried out to test mycorrhizal performance and P acquisition of chili pepper and sweet corn (Zea mays L. var. rugosa Bonaf.) in two compartments, which were absolutely separated (Sep) by polyvinyl chloride (PVC) layer or semi-separated (Semi-Sep) by nylon mesh (30m) screen that only allows the passage of AM fungal hyphae but not plant roots. Root mycorrhizal colonization rates and the biomasses and P concentrations of shoots, roots, and fruits of pepper and corn were all measured. The total P acquisition of each crop per pot and the acquisition ratio of one to two crops were assessed. Soil pH, organic C, total P, available P, AM fungal abundance, and acid phosphatase activity were also tested. Results and discussion In the Sep system, root mycorrhizal colonization, P acquisition amount, shoot biomass, and rhizosphere AM fungal abundance of corn were all higher (P < 0.05) than those of pepper, but soil available P concentration was lower (P<0.05) in corn compartment than in pepper one. Compared with Sep, Semi-Sep had higher (P<0.05) mycorrhizal colonization rates with both intercrops and higher (P<0.05) soil acid phosphatase activity and AM fungal abundance in corn and pepper compartments, respectively. Semi-Sep decreased (P<0.05) soil available P concentrations with both compartments, but did not narrow the difference of soil available P concentration between compartments, suggesting there was no gradient diffusion of soil available P between compartments. Semi-Sep increased (P<0.05) the P acquisition ratio and fruit yield of pepper, but not corn. Conclusions Constitution of hyphal networks increased mycorrhizal colonization with both intercrops, and corn supplied part of photosynthetic C for increasing AM fungal propagules in pepper compartment by gradient expansion since AM fungi formed better symbioses with corn. Hyphal networks increased pepper fruit yield via improving P distribution to pepper, but acquired relatively higher P from corn compartment via elevating the soil acid phosphatase activity, suggesting enhanced P competitive ability of pepper against corn upon hyphal networks.

Systematic changes in phenotype, physiology, yield, and gene regulation under shade stress in peanut are largely unknown, although shade responses have been well analyzed in model plants. We exposed peanut plants to simulated 40% and 80% shade for 15 and 30 days at the seedling stage, flowering stage, and both stages. Shade caused the increased elongation growth of the main stem, internode, and leaf, and elongation was positively associated with auxin levels. Shade stress reduced peanut yield. Further comparative RNA-seq analyses revealed expressional changes in many metabolism pathways and common core sets of expressional regulations in all shade treatments. Expressional downregulation of most genes for light-harvesting and photosynthesis agreed with the observed decreased parameters of photosynthesis processes. Other major regulations included expressional downregulation of most core genes in the sucrose and starch metabolism, and growth-promoting genes in plant hormone signal pathways. Together, the results advance our understanding of physiological and molecular regulation in shade avoidance in peanut, which could guide the breeding designing in the intercropping system."

The crop rotations were established in 1988 and fertilizer N was not applied to any plots. The plots were sampled five times over the growing season in 1990. The average size of microbial N over the growing season was 20% greater when barley followed fababean or intercropping than in the fababean and intercropped plots. It was 14.9% greater when barley followed fababean or intercropping than in the continuous barley plots. Protozoa populations were greater when barley followed intercropping than in the continuous barley plots, but an inverse trend was found for nematode populations. Average size of the mineral N over the growing season in the LC-year rotation plots was 32% greater than in the continuous barley plots. It was also 23% greater when barley followed fababean or intercropping than in the fababean and intercropped plots. Plant N in the latter plots was significantly greater than in the former and in continuous barley plots; therefore legumes contributed N to the crop rotation through biological N fixation and addition of N-rich crop residues.

J	"Snapp, SS; Silim, SN"				"Snapp, SS; Silim, SN"			Farmer preferences and legume intensification for low nutrient environments	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article							"MANAGEMENT; PHOSPHORUS"	"Improved varieties of legumes adapted to nutrient deficiency have the potential to improve food security for the poorest farmers. Tolerant varieties could be an inexpensive and biologically smart technology that improves soils while minimizing fertilizer costs. Yet other technologies that improve productivity and appear to be biologically sound have been rejected by farmers. To translate benefits to smallholder farmers, research on low-nutrient tolerant genes and crop improvement must keep farmer preferences and belief systems in the forefront. We review farmer participatory research on legume-intensification and soil fertility management options for smallholder farmers in Africa, including recent results from our work in Malawi and Kenya. We suggest that indeterminate, long-duration legumes are the best bet for producing high quality residues, compared to short-duration and determinate genotypes. This may be due to a long period of time to biologically fix nitrogen, acquire nutrients, photosynthesize and grain fill. Also, the indeterminate nature of long-duration varieties facilitates recovery from intermittent stresses such as drought or pest pressure. However, indeterminate growth habit is also associated with late maturity, moderate yield potential and high labour demand. These traits are not necessarily compatible with smallholder criteria for acceptable varieties. Malawi women farmers, for example, prioritized early maturity and low-labour requirement, as well as yield potential. To address complex farmer requirements, we suggest the purposeful combination of species with different growth habits; e. g. deep-rooted indeterminate long-duration pigeonpea interplanted with short-duration soyabean and groudnut varieties. On-farm trials in Malawi indicate that calorie production can be increased by 30% through pigeonpea-intensified systems. Farmers consistently indicate strong interest in these systems. In Kenya, a 55% yield increase was observed for a doubled-up pigeonpea system (a double row of pigeonpea intercropped with three maize rows) compared to traditional, low density intercrops. However, the need for improved pigeonpea varieties with high intercrop suitability, including reduced early branching, was highlighted by a farmer preference study in the same area. These examples illustrate the potential for participatory research methodologies to drive biophysical research in farmer-acceptable directions."

A review of papers in Experimental Agriculture and Journal of Agricultural Science (Cambridge) in the years 1990-1999 gave 50 papers on intercropping from which 72 experiments were examined. The objectives of experiments, apart from virtually all being concerned with crop yield under intercropping, were dominated by interest in management methods affecting intercropping benefit, with concerns about the economic analysis of intercropping benefits and of the sustainability of tested systems and in the mechanisms underlying intercropping effects. Concerns about stability and sustainability were not as central as might have been expected. Few experiments were mainly concerned with exploring the way in which species interact in mixture as an explanation of intercropping effects (e.g. through manipulation of the timing of planting or examination of root and shoot competition). Close to half the studies used the additive series design with pairwise, replacement series and response model designs each accounting for about 17% of cases. Only two studies measured at the level of the individual plant and only two studies included initial indicators of plant size or other biological starting point. Analysis of the combination of experimental design used, the measurements taken and the statistical analysis performed showed that while most experiments could provide some valid indicators and thus inferences on crop yields few of them could be used to address questions on the inter- and intraspecific interactions leading to the intercropping outcomes. The duration of experiments was 1 year for about half of experiments involving annual species only and about one-third of experiments involving at least one perennial species. The overall conclusion is that considerable care needs to taken to ensure that the indicators and experimental methods used are appropriate to the development and testing of sustainable systems based on intercropping.

Ecological and agro-economic study of small farms in sub-Saharan Africa	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						"agro-ecological sustainability; drylands; production risks; socio-economic sustainability; sustainable agriculture"	SYSTEMS	Land degradation, rising population and poverty in sub- Saharan Africa threatens the agricultural sustainability and productivity, quality of the environment and socio- economic wellbeing of rural populations. We studied farm ecological, economic and social sustainability, productivity and production risks in the Mbeere District of Eastern Kenya. We used a soil nutrient monitoring methodology to collect data from 30 households. Ecological sustainability was threatened by soil nutrient decline at rates of 1.7 kg P and 5.4 kg K ha(-1) half year(-1) while N was nearly balanced in soils. Soil phosphorus and potassium stocks, in the cultivated soils, declined at rates of 0.3% and 0.1% half year(-1), respectively. Farm economic returns were positive, albeit low, and could not sustain the livelihoods of the households. All the 30 households were living below the poverty line of 1 US dollar a day. Farm productivity was low, with livestock and yields of major staple food crops below on- farm target yields. To spread out the risks of production, farming households were cultivating an average of 4.7 crop fields, keeping more than two types of livestock and practising intercropping systems. Intercropping maize- beans reduced nutrient decline and raised household incomes compared with monocropping of either of the two crops. Despite the low rates of nutrient decline, high risks of production and the low crop yields, the livestock productivity and farm economic performance put the sustainability of these farming systems into question. The low levels of nutrient decline in small farms averaging at 1.7 kg P and 5.4 kg K ha(-1) half year(-1) contrasts with the high nutrient depletion rates on macro- scale levels, e. g. 20 - 40 N, 3.5 - 6.6 kg P and 20 - 40 kg K ha(-1) year(-1) for Eastern African countries and 22 kg N, 2.5 kg P and 15 kg K ha(-1) year(-1) for sub- Saharan Africa. These findings indicate that the extent of nutrient decline and conservation differs across sub-Saharan Africa. The positive contribution of intercropping to nutrient balances suggests the need to encourage farmers to adopt such systems rather than monocropping.

J	"Loland, JO; Singh, BR"				"Loland, JO; Singh, BR"			Copper contamination of soil and vegetation in coffee orchards after long-term use of Cu fungicides	NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						"coffee; coffee disease; copper contamination; food crops; fungicides and soils; Tanzania"	"HEAVY-METALS; ORGANIC-MATTER; AVAILABILITY; PLANTS; TRACE; ACID"	The repeated use of Cu fungicides to control coffee berry disease can result in increased Cu content in soils and vegetation and thus raising the pollution levels and a concern for potential effects on human health. Therefore a field survey of coffee orchards of the Kilimanjaro and Arusha regions of Tanzania, where Cu fungicides are frequently used, was conducted to determine the possible Cu contamination of soils and vegetation. Soil samples were collected from 0-5, 5-15 and 15-30 cm depth at a distance of 0.5 m from the trunk of coffee trees. Plant leaf samples of beans and maize crops intercropped with coffee trees as well as leaves of coffee trees, were also collected at the same time and places. Soil and plant samples were collected both from small farms and commercial estates. Copper in the soil samples was extracted with CaCl2 (CCu), whereas for the total Cu, samples were digested with aqua regia (HNO3 and HCl (1:3) (ACu)). Plant samples were drying ashed and digested with HNO3. Copper concentration in the extracted and digested solutions was determined with atomic absorption spectrophotometry. A significant Cu enrichment of the soils was observed and the Cu concentration in the 0-5 cm soil depth was about three times higher than in the 15 - 30 cm depth. A large variability in the soil Cu concentration between fields of the same farm and within the same orchard was observed. The differences in the total Cu concentration (ACu) between small farms and commercial estates were not statistically significant, but the extractable Cu (CCu) was higher and soil pH was lower in the estates of the Kilimanjaro region than at small farms. The soil organic carbon (SOC) content increased significantly with increasing altitudes, and it was also higher on small farms than on commercial estates. The SOC content showed a close and positive correlation with total Cu. At soil pH below 5.3, the CCu fraction increased steeply. Bean plants from coffee fields showed a high concentration of Cu, suggesting a possible Cu toxicity problem in bean plants. Coffee leaves also showed extremely high Cu concentration.

The typical cropping cycle in the region includes monocrops or intercrops of maize (Zea mays L.), beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and/or cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz). Cassava is usually the last crop before local farmers leave plots to natural fallow until soil fertility is recovered and a new cropping phase can be initiated. Previous studies on land use in the Rio Cabuyal watershed (6500 ha) show that a considerable proportion of land (about 25-30%) remains under natural fallow every year. The focus of our studies is on systems of accelerated regeneration of soil fertility, or improved fallow systems, as an alternative to the natural regeneration by the native flora. Fallow improvement studies were conducted on plots following cassava cultivation. The potential for soil fertility recovery after 12 and 28 months was evaluated with two fast growing trees, Calliandra calothyrsus Meissn (CAL) and Indigofera constricta L.(IND), and one shrub, Tithonia diversifolia (Hemsl.) Gray (TTH), as slash/mulch fallow systems compared to the natural fallow (NAT). All planted slash/mulch fallow systems produced greater biomass than the natural fallow. Greatest dry biomass (16.4 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) was produced by TTH. Other planted fallows (CAL and IND) produced about 40% less biomass than TTH and the control (NAT) about 75% less. Nutrient levels in the biomass were especially high for TTH, followed by IND, CAL, and NAT. The impact of fallow management on soil chemical, physical and biological parameters related to residual soil fertility during the cropping phase was evaluated. Soil parameters most affected by slash/mulch fallow systems included soil total N, available N (ammonium and nitrate), exchangeable cations (K, Ca, Mg and Al), amount of Pin light fraction, soil bulk density and air permeability, and soil macrofauna diversity. Results from field studies suggest that the Tithonia slash/mulch fallow system could be the best option to regenerate soil fertility of degraded volcanic-ash soils of the Andean hillsides.

Induces Nutrient Concentration Changes in the Soil and Plants in Continuously Cropped Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) in a Plastic Tunnel	PLOS ONE			English	Article							"NITROGEN TRANSFER; ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; FUSARIUM-WILT; WHITE LUPIN; PHOSPHORUS; MAIZE; NUTRITION; WHEAT; RHIZOSPHERE; MAGNESIUM"	A pot-based experiment was conducted to investigate nutrient concentrations in cucumber plants intercropped with various amounts of green garlic. In addition, the soil nutrient contents were studied over two consecutive growing seasons. The results revealed that the accumulation of biomass and the nutritional elements nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and manganese (Mn) in cucumber plants were significantly increased for intercropping treatments during the two growing seasons compared to monoculture. Conversely, magnesium (Mg) concentrations were decreased in the cucumber plants. Shoot iron (Fe) concentrations decreased whereas root Fe concentrations increased in the intercropping system. Shoot and root zinc (Zn) concentrations decreased during the fall of 2011 but increased during the spring of 2012. Soil organic matter and available N, P and K were significantly increased as the proportion of intercropped green garlic increasing. Medium levels of intercropping green garlic improved cucumber nutrient concentrations the most. The regression analysis showed that the concentrations of most elements were significantly related to the amounts of garlic bulbs, especially the microelements in the spring 2011. The available soil N and organic matter were linearly related to the amounts of garlic bulbs. The results indicate that the nutritional status of the soil and plants of continuously cropped cucumber could be improved by intercropping with green garlic.

Combined field experimentation and crop growth modelling during the past five decades made a great leap forward in the understanding of factors that determine actual and potential yields of monocrops. The research field of production ecology developed concepts to integrate biological and biophysical processes with the aim to explore crop growth potential in contrasting environments. To understand the potential of more complex systems (multi-cropping and intercropping) we need an agro-ecosystem approach that integrates knowledge derived from various disciplines: agronomy, crop physiology, crop ecology, and environmental sciences (soil, water and climate). Adaptation of cropping systems to climate change and a better tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses by genetic improvement and by managing diverse cropping systems in a sustainable way will be of key importance in food security. To accelerate sustainable intensification of agricultural production, it is required to develop intercropping systems that are highly productive and stable under conditions with abiotic constraints (water, nutrients and weather). Strategies to achieve sustainable intensification include developing tools to evaluate crop growth potential under more extreme climatic conditions and introducing new crops and cropping systems that are more productive and robust under conditions with abiotic stress. This paper presents some examples of sustainable intensification management of intercropping systems that proved to be tolerant to extreme climate conditions.

"The objective of this work was to evaluate the productive performance, biological efficiency, and the competitive ability of the forage cactus-sorghum intercropping under different irrigation depths with saline water in the Brazilian Semiarid Region. The experiment was carried out in Serra Talhada, in the state of Pernambuco, between 2014 and 2015, in a randomized complete block design, with four replicates, and a 5x3 factorial arrangement in split plots, with one year of forage cactus cycle and two years of sorghum cycles. The plots were composed by four irrigation water depths based on the fractions of 25, 50, 75, and 100% of the reference evapotranspiration, besides dry conditions; and the subplots consisted of three cropping systems (single crop of forage cactus, single crop of sorghum, and intercropping of forage cactus-sorghum). The increase of water irrigation depths increased the yields of sorghum in single crop and of the forage cactus-sorghum intercropping. The intercropping system promoted production stability with a higher system productivity index (SPI) for forage cactus-sorghum intercropping (6,279.02 kg ha(-1) DM) than for forage cactus in single crop (4,626.98 kg ha(-1) DM). The relative density coefficient (12.33) was indicative of the great compatibility of the intercropping system. The forage cactus-sorghum association shows biological advantage and competitiveness capacity, with a higher productive index than their monocultures."

Performance of forage sorghum intercropped with forage legumes under different planting patterns	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article							"MAIZE ZEA-MAYS; COWPEA VIGNA-UNGUICULATA; NITROGEN"	An experiment was conducted to study the feasibility of forage legume intercropping in forage-sorghum based intercropping system at 30 cm spaced single rows, 30 x 30 cm cross planting with intercrop, 45 cm spaced two-row strips (15/45 cm) and 75 cm spaced four-row strips. The results displayed that the highest forage yield (46.1 t ha(-1)) was obtained from sorghum grown alone in 45 cm spaced paired rows compared to the minimum of 36.0 t ha(-1), from sorghum intercropped with clusterbean under the pattern of 75 cm spaced four-row strips. The data exhibited that planting geometry of 45 cm spaced double-row strips produced the highest forage sorghum yield during both the years while in intercropping systems, sorghum alone produced significantly the maximum green forage yield in 30 cm spaced single rows. Legume associations decrease the forage sorghum yield than pure stand of sorghum. However, intercropping of forage sorghum with legumes in the pattern of 45 cm spaced double-row strips appeared to be more productive and profitable than the monocropped sorghum. It would suggest that for the purpose of getting higher yield of palatable, nutritious and high quality sorghum fodder, farmers should adopt the practice of intercropping forage sorghum with forage legumes, preferably cowpea and sesbania, under the planting pattern of 45-cm spaced two-row strips with 15 cm space between the rows in a strip (15/45).

Walp.] intercrop well with upland rice (Oryza sativa L.), with N benefits to rice regarded as factor contributing to the productivity of the intercrop. The effects of crop proportion, seeding rate, cowpea lines, organic amendment, and water availability on N yields of the two species were examined in six field experiments. When intercropped with cowpea line IT82D-889, rice N yield consistently increased as cowpea replaced up to 50% rice. Above 50%, the effect on rice N yield was not consistent. Cowpea N yield increased sharply as cowpea proportion increased. At the 50:50 species ratio, N yields relative to those of monocrops were 0.70 for rice and 0.71 for cowpea. In a comparison of cowpea lines at a 50:50 species ratio, the early-maturing, determinate IT82D-889 accumulated 68 kg N ha-1, whereas later-maturing lines accumulated as much as 40% more N. The viney habit of the late-maturing lines, however, made them incompatible with rice. Seeding rates affected N yields of both species. Rice and cowpea yields increased 0.54 and 0.88 kg N ha-1 for each kg ha-1 cowpea seed increase. However, for each 10 kg ha-1 rice seed increase, rice N yield increased 1.06 kg ha-1 but cowpea N yield decreased 0.54 kg ha-1 Water stress imposed by a line-sources irrigation system increased N yields of both species, but organic N amendment (75 kg N ha-1 from manures) had only a small effect on N yields. Neither water availability nor soil fertility status strongly interacted with crop proportion to influence the N benefit from intercropping. These experiments demonstrated that, given a determinate, early-maturing, nonviney cowpea cultivar, intercropping increased rice N yield. Maximum total N yield (rice+cowpea) occured when approximately half the intercropped area was planted to cowpea.

Objective: To evaluate the effects of different palisade grass plant arrangements and their control on physiological characteristics and corn yield. Methods: Two trials in randomized complete block design with four replications were conducted in field conditions. In the first, corn was sown with 0.50 m row spacing, whereas the second had 1.00 m row spacing. All the treatments were arranged in the same way in both experiments, in a 2x4 factorial design. The first factor was the nicosulfuron dose applied (0 and 8 g a.i. ha(-1)), and the second, the forage seeding rates (0, 2, 4, and 6 kg of seeds per hectare). Sowing of both species was performed on the same day. Results: The application of nicosulfuron negatively affected stomatal conductance, internal carbon concentration, and increased CO2 consumption and efficiency in water use. The photosynthetic rate was not affected by the herbicide application, however it presented lower values in the 0.50 m spacing. Although the yield was not affected by row spacing, it was higher when nicosulfuron was applied. Conclusions: The increase in palisade grass density caused detrimental changes in the water use efficiency with direct consequences to the crop yield. The physiological response and corn yield depend on the arrangement of plants and the palisade grass management adopted.	"[Freitas, Marco A.

The study took place under furrow irrigation in north-central New Mexico (study site elevation, 1737 m) on a Fruitland sandy loam (coarse-loamy, mixed, calcareous, mesic Typic Torriorthent). Five legumes (hairy vetch, Vicia villosa Both; barrel medic, Medicago truncatula Gaertn.; alfalfa, Medicago sativa L.; black lentil, Lens culinaris Medik.; and red clover, Trifolium pratense L.) were interseeded into sweet corn at last cultivation or blister stage in 1993 and 1994. Corn ears and stover were harvested in August. The following spring, plots were plowed and seeded to forage sorghum. Estimated FRV for the legumes were calculated from regression equations for sorghum dry matter yield as a function of N fertilizer rate. Herbage N yields in the fall were greatest for hairy vetch and barrel medic and, averaged across interseeding dates, ranged from 55 to 64 kg ha(-1) in 1993 and 100 to 108 kg ha(-1) in 1994. Whole-plant N yields (herbage + roots + crowns) in May were greatest for hairy vetch, 205 kg ha(-1) in 1994 and 172 kg ha(-1) in 1995. Seasonal dry matter yield and N uptake of sorghum were greatest following hairy vetch in 1994, and hairy vetch and alfalfa in 1995.

This was evaluated using a structured face to face questionnaire with a sample of 97 farmers on knowledge, attitude and practices, which was conducted in Gewa ward, Githuguri Constituency in Kiambu County by replicating similar conditions of Arabica coffee growing areas in the tropics, where most farmers practice mixed farming. A linear regression model was used to evaluate the relationship between commercial feeds and milk production. The results indicated a significant contribution of close to 70% implying that commercial feed contribution to milk production, which was estimated to be US$ 0.2 (KSh 19) per liter of milk produced, was indicative of the impact of the lack of adequate fodder. Despite the possibility of using the desmodium legume fodder production as a coffee cover crop, the attitude varied, and there is still a significant reliance on commercial feeds for the success in milk production. Farmers generally intercrop coffee with various annual crops with a notable lack of knowledge on complementarity and related ecosystem services of desmodium as cover crops. The coffee and livestock farmers reported that weather variability exacerbates feed scarcity, increasing dependence on commercial livestock feed purchases. Milk production, being a major economic focus in many coffee areas, is mainly supported by the purchase of commercial feeds, whose volume increases when rainfall is inadequate or delayed. Our findings indicate that the adoption of legume fodder cover crops in coffee cultivation would reduce farmers' reliance on commercial feeds and increase incomes, while benefiting from ecosystem services, when adopting sustainable agricultural intensification with changing climate remaining a major concern thereby increasing their resilience.

The study was carried out under irrigated conditions in 1994 on a Fruitland sandy loam (coarse-loamy, mixed, calcareous, mesic Typic Torriorthent) to evaluate the N-15 recovery by forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor [L.] Moench) and soil after the incorporation of N-15-labeled alfalfa (Medicago sativa L. 'Nitro') or hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth. 'Madison'). Two application rates of alfalfa (2.7 or 4.0 Mg dry matter ha(-1)) or hairy vetch herbage (3.2 or 6.4 Mg dry matter ha(-1)); were incorporated into soil microplots. Additional treatments consisting of 56, 112, and 168 kg N ha(-1) (as urea) were used to compare soil inorganic N concentrations with those released from the legumes. Nitrogen-15 recovery by sorghum tops was 16% of the N-15 applied, in two harvests. Of this, 80% was recovered at the first harvest. In soil, N-15 recoveries were 50 and 3% of the input at the 0-0.3 and 0.3-0.6 m depths, respectively. Maximum inorganic N concentrations were found 14 d after amendment application. At the end of the growing season, inorganic N concentrations in all treatments were essentially the same as the background (8 mg N kg(-1)). The low N-15 recoveries by crop plus soil and inorganic N concentrations in soil at the end of the season suggest that about 12% and 35-58% of the N applied as green manure was lost from the system for alfalfa and hairy vetch, respectively.

Data collected include cost of fixed assets, cost of variable inputs, yields and prices of outputs. Data were subjected to budgetary technique; analysis of variance and significant means were separated using Duncan's Multiple Range Test at 5% level of probability. Results of the gross margin analysis showed that both the intercropping and only sole Amaranth vegetable production were profitable. The intercrop production had a gross margin of (sic)567,920/ha with a total revenue of (sic)1, 600,000 /ha and having the highest output of 8000kg/ha while the sole Amaranth vegetable production had a gross margin of (sic)179, 920/ha with a total revenue of (sic)1,200,000/ha and having an output of 6000kg/ha. Also, the intercrop vegetable production had a benefit cost ratio, rate of return and gross ratio of 1.51, 0.52 and 0.66, respectively while sole Amaranth production had a benefit cost ratio, rate of return and gross ratio of 1.15, 0.15 and 0.87, respectively. The result indicates that the two vegetable productions were profitable. Further analysis revealed that intercropping did not have significant (p < 0.05) effect on the growth (plant height, number of leaves) of both vegetables. However, Jute yield was significantly (p < 0.01) affected by Amaranth-Jute intercropping. Both the intercrop and sole Amaranth enterprises were profitable, but there was a significant difference in the profitability of the intercrop cropping system practised as the Amaranth/Jute intercrop was more profitable. The intercrop is, therefore, recommended to farmers since it is more profitable and provides a variety of income generation for the farmer's thereby ensuring food and income security."

J	"Miao, YX; Stewart, BA; Zhang, FS"				"Miao, Yuxin; Stewart, Bobby A.; Zhang, Fusuo"			Long-term experiments for sustainable nutrient management in China. A review	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Review						"sustainable nutrient management; long-term experiment; chemical fertilizer; organic fertilizer; precision nutrient management; small-scale farming; intensive farming; precision agriculture"	"NITROGEN-USE EFFICIENCY; SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER; ON-FARM EVALUATION; TAI LAKE REGION; NORTH CHINA; AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; PRODUCTION SYSTEMS; NITRATE POLLUTION; CEREAL PRODUCTION"	China is facing one of the largest challenges of this century to continue to increase annual cereal production to about 600 Mt by 2030 to ensure food security with shrinking cropland and limited resources, while maintaining or improving soil fertility, and protecting the environment. Rich experiences in integrated and efficient utilization of different strategies of crop rotation, intercropping, and all possible nutrient resources accumulated by Chinese farmers in traditional farming systems have been gradually abandoned and nutrient management shifted to over-reliance on synthetic fertilizers. China is now the world's largest producer, consumer and importer of chemical fertilizers. Overapplication of nitrogen (N) is common in intensive agricultural regions, and current N-uptake efficiency was reported to be only 28.3, 28.2 and 26.1% for rice, wheat and maize, respectively, and less than 20% in intensive agricultural regions and for fruit trees or vegetable crops. In addition to surface and groundwater pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, over-application of N fertilizers has caused significant soil acidification in major Chinese croplands, decreasing soil pH by 0.13 to 2.20. High yield as a top priority, small-scale farming, lack of temporal synchronization of nutrient supply and crop demand, lack of effective extension systems, and hand application of fertilizers by farmers are possible reasons leading to the over-application problems. There is little doubt that current nutrient management practices are not sustainable and more efficient management systems need to be developed. A review of long-term experiments conducted around the world indicated that chemical fertilizer alone is not enough to improve or maintain soil fertility at high levels and the soil acidification problem caused by overapplication of synthetic N fertilizers can be reduced if more fertilizer N is applied as NO (3) (-) relative to ammonium- or urea-based N fertilizers. Organic fertilizers can improve soil fertility and quality, but long-term application at high rates can also lead to more nitrate leaching, and accumulation of P, if not managed well. Well-managed combination of chemical and organic fertilizers can overcome the disadvantages of applying single source of fertilizers and sustainably achieve higher crop yields, improve soil fertility, alleviate soil acidification problems, and increase nutrient-use efficiency compared with only using chemical fertilizers. Crop yield can be increased through temporal diversity using crop rotation strategies compared with continuous cropping and legume-based cropping systems can reduce carbon and nitrogen losses. Crop yield responses to N fertilization can vary significantly from year to year due to variation in weather conditions and indigenous N supply, thus the commonly adopted prescriptive approach to N management needs to be replaced by a responsive in-season management approach based on diagnosis of crop growth, N status and demand. A crop sensor-based in-season site-specific N management strategy was able to increase Nuptake efficiency by 368% over farmers' practices in the North China Plain. Combination of these well-tested nutrient management principles and practices with modern crop management technologies is needed to develop sustainable nutrient management systems in China that can precisely match field-to-field and year-to-year variability in nutrient supply and crop demand for both single crops and crop rotations to not only improve nutrient-use efficiency but also increase crop yieldand protect the environment. In addition, innovative and effective extension and service-providing systems to assist farmers in adopting and applying new management systems and technologies are also crucially important for China to meet the grand challenge of food security, nutrient-use efficiency and sustainable development.

However, CRF release characteristics are related to various factors such as soil properties, temperature and precipitation, and further study is needed in developing suitable fertilizer formulas adapting to local conditions. In this study, five types of CRF were used for a one-time application in a two-year field experiment conducted at two sites with two wheat cultivars. Their effects on soil inorganic nitrogen (SIN) content, nitrogen uptake, wheat growth and grain yield were investigated. The results indicated that nitrogen supply in the CRF-60/80 treatments not only ensured the tiller differentiation at the early growth stage, but also provided adequate SIN after the jointing stage, thereby facilitating the dry matter accumulation and improving post-anthesis photosynthates accumulating in grains. When compared with conventional split fertilization, the CRF-60 and 80 treatments improved the NUE by 9.7-12.1%, and boosted farmers' economic efficiency by 282.4-327.2 CNY ha(-1). According to our research, a one-time application of CRF-60 and CRF-80 could meet the needs of the two-peak nitrogen demand of wheat in Jiangyan and Yanghzou respectively, therefore increasing NUE and having low labor costs for wheat fertilizer application.

The total 5 ratios of NH4+/NO3- were applied as follows: T0 = 0/0 (control), T1 = 0/100 (higher ratio), T2 = 25/75 (optimum), T3 = 50/50 (optimum), and T4 = 75/25 (higher ratio) as a nitrogen source. Our findings displayed that the T2 (25/75) and T3 (50/50) treatments alleviated the shading stress by improving the photosynthetic activity, biomass accumulation, carbohydrates contents, and lignin related enzymes (POD, CAD, and 4Cl) which led to improvement in stem lodging resistance. The correlation analysis (p <= 0.05, p <= 0.01) revealed the strong relationship between lodging resistance index and stem diameter, stem strength, lignin content, photosynthesis, and lignin related enzymes (POD, CAD, and 4CL) evidencing the strong contribution of lignin and its related enzymes in the improvement of lodging resistance of soybean stem under shade conditions. Collectively, we concluded that optimum NH4+/NO3- ratios (T2 and T3) can boost up the lodging resistance of soybean stem under shade stress.

How the Nitrogen Economy of a Perennial Cereal-Legume Intercrop Affects Productivity: Can Synchrony Be Achieved?	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Article						"alfalfa; intermediate wheatgrass; Kernza (R); perennial grain; UN Sustainable Development Goal; zero hunger; ecological nutrient management"	"SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER; N-15 NATURAL-ABUNDANCE; CROPPING SYSTEMS; N-2 FIXATION; INTERMEDIATE WHEATGRASS; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; UPPER MIDWEST; WHITE CLOVER; GRAIN; ROOT"	The UN's Sustainable Development goal of Zero Hunger encompasses a holistic set of targets that range from ending hunger by 2030, to increasing environmental sustainability and resilience of food production. Securing and managing soil nutrients remains one of the most basic challenges to growing adequate food while simultaneously protecting biodiversity and the integrity of ecosystems. To achieve these objectives, it is increasingly clear that the management of ecological processes will need to supplant reliance on non-renewable and environmentally damaging inputs. In recent years, progress has been made in developing perennial grain crops that show promise to improve on a range of ecological functions such as efficient nitrogen cycling and soil carbon accretion that tend to be well-developed in natural ecosystems but become compromised following land conversion to row crop agriculture. Here we report on a multi-faceted, 5-year experiment in which intermediate wheatgrass (IWG) (Thinopyrum intermedium), a perennial relative of wheat that is bred to produce the grain Kernza (R), was intercropped in alternating rows with the perennial legume alfalfa (Medicago sativa). The performance of the unfertilized intercrop was compared to monocropped IWG treatments, with and without urea-N applications, planted at two row densities such that the intercrop could be interpreted as either an addition or substitution design. Comparisons of relative IWG yields (RYs) in the intercrop with unfertilized monocrops suggest net competitive interactions between alfalfa and IWG in the establishment year, followed by increasing degrees of facilitation over the next 4 years. Evidence from N fertilizer responsiveness, SPAD readings, net N mineralization assays, and N balance calculations suggest that alfalfa contributed to an aggrading pool of soil organic nitrogen over the course of the experiment. Comparisons of grain RYs of intercropped IWG and fertilized IWG monocultures suggest N-limitation in the first half of the experiment, and N sufficiency in the second half. Grain yields in the intercrop did not decline significantly over 5 years in contrast to all IWG monocrop treatments that did significantly decline. This study contributes to a growing literature on approaches to ecological nutrient management that incorporate diversity and perenniality to increase food security and resilience.

Plant Breeding for Intercropping in Temperate Field Crop Systems: A Review	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Review						"agroecology; ecosystem services; intercropping; plant breeding; polyculture; sustainable cropping systems"	"BIOLOGICAL NITRIFICATION INHIBITION; PERENNIAL RYEGRASS MIXTURES; WHITE CLOVER; FORAGE YIELD; LIVING MULCH; WEED SUPPRESSION; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; INTERMEDIATE WHEATGRASS; BIRDSFOOT-TREFOIL; TALL FESCUE"	Monoculture cropping systems currently dominate temperate agroecosystems. However, intercropping can provide valuable benefits, including greater yield stability, increased total productivity, and resilience in the face of pest and disease outbreaks. Plant breeding efforts in temperate field crops are largely focused on monoculture production, but as intercropping becomes more widespread, there is a need for cultivars adapted to these cropping systems. Cultivar development for intercropping systems requires a systems approach, from the decision to breed for intercropping systems through the final stages of variety testing and release. Design of a breeding scheme should include information about species variation for performance in intercropping, presence of genotype x management interaction, observation of key traits conferring success in intercropping systems, and the specificity of intercropping performance. Together this information can help to identify an optimal selection scheme. Agronomic and ecological knowledge are critical in the design of selection schemes in cropping systems with greater complexity, and interaction with other researchers and key stakeholders inform breeding decisions throughout the process. This review explores the above considerations through three case studies: (1) forage mixtures, (2) perennial groundcover systems (PGC), and (3) soybean-pennycress intercropping. We provide an overview of each cropping system, identify relevant considerations for plant breeding efforts, describe previous breeding focused on the cropping system, examine the extent to which proposed theoretical approaches have been implemented in breeding programs, and identify areas for future development.

Here, we compared the effects of two shade signals, low red light to far-red light ratio (R:FR) and low blue light (LBL), on soybean status and revealed that LBL predominantly induces excessive stem elongation. We used CRISPR-Cas9-engineered Gmcry mutants to investigate the functions of seven cryptochromes (GmCRYs) in soybean and found that the four GmCRY1s overlap in mediating LBL-induced SAS. Light-activated GmCRY1s increase the abundance of the bZIP transcription factors STF1 and STF2, which directly upregulate the expression of genes encoding GA2 oxidases to deactivate GA-1 and repress stem elongation. Notably, GmCRY1b overexpression lines displayed multiple agronomic advantages over the wild-type control under both dense planting and intercropping conditions. Our study demonstrates the integration of GmCRY1-mediated signals with the GA metabolic pathway in the regulation of LBL-induced SAS in soybean. It also provides a promising option for breeding lodging-resistant, high-yield soybean cultivars in the future.

The effects of vermicompost and the different patterns of intercropping, including corn, peanut and borage are evaluated on optimum conditions of chemical soil elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, sodium and carbon. The experimental data are extracted form a dry climatic region in southeast Iran, using three levels of vermicompost (0, 2.5, and 5 t/ha) and nine levels for the intercropping (including pure culture of corn, peanut, and borage in the following proportions: replacement and additive design) using split plot design, which is based on RCBD with three replications during 2015-2016. The Nonlinear Modeling-based Response Surface Method is used to predict the chemical soil elements based on vermicompost and intercropping. The effects of the different culture patterns are investigated to illustrate the sensitivity of soil fertilization. The best pattern to improve the soil's elements is obtained by increasing the proportion of the peanut in intercropping, introducing five t/ha of vermicompost, and establishing an intercropping of 80% peanut + 50% corn + 50% borage for increasing the soil nutrients.

Gibberellins (GAs) and auxin [indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)] play important roles in mediating the shading adaptive responses of plants. Thus, the intensity and quality of the uncoupling light from shading were assessed to identify the influence of each component on the morphology and matter distribution of the leaf, stem, and petiole. This assessment was based on the changes in endogenous Gibberellin 1 (GA1) and IAA levels. Soybean plants were grown in a growth chamber with four treatments [normal (N), N C Fr, low (L), and L C Fr light]. Results revealed that the reductions in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and R/Fr ratio equally increased height and stem mass fractions (SMFs) of the soybean seedling. The light intensity significantly influenced the dry mass per unit area and mass fraction of soybean leaves, whereas the light quality regulated the petiole elongation and mass fraction. Low R/Fr ratio (high Fr light) increased the soybean biomass by improving the photosynthetic assimilation rate and quantum yield of photosystem II. In addition, the IAA and GA1 levels in the leaf, stem, and petiole did not reflect the growth response trends of each tissue toward light intensity and quality; however, trends of the IAA-to-GA1 content ratios were similar to those of the growth and matter allocation of each soybean tissue under different light environments. Therefore, the response of growth and matter allocation of soybean to light intensity and quality may be regulated by the IAA-to-GA1 content ratio in the tissues of the soybean plant."

Response-based selection of barley cultivars and legume species for complementarity: Root morphology and exudation in relation to nutrient source	PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						"Barley; Legumes; Plant nutrition; Root morphology; Exudation"	"ORGANIC ANION EXUDATION; PHOSPHORUS UPTAKE; SEMINAL ROOT; COMPOSITIONAL ANALYSIS; PHYSIOLOGICAL TRAITS; NICOTIANA-TABACUM; HORDEUM-VULGARE; SOIL; WHEAT; ACID"	Phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) use efficiency may be improved through increased biodiversity in agroecosystems. Phenotypic variation in plants' response to nutrient deficiency may influence positive complementarity in intercropping systems. A multicomponent screening approach was used to assess the influence of P supply and N source on the phenotypic plasticity of nutrient foraging traits in barley (H. vulgare L) and legume species. Root morphology and exudation were determined in six plant nutrient treatments. A clear divergence in the response of barley and legumes to the nutrient treatments was observed. Root morphology varied most among legumes, whereas exudate citrate and phytase activity were most variable in barley. Changes in root morphology were minimized in plants provided with ammonium in comparison to nitrate but increased under P deficiency. Exudate phytase activity and pH varied with legume species, whereas citrate efflux, specific root length, and root diameter lengths were more variable among barley cultivars. Three legume species and four barley cultivars were identified as the most responsive to P deficiency and the most contrasting of the cultivars and species tested. Phenotypic response to nutrient availability may be a promising approach for the selection of plant combinations for minimal input cropping systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Among Host and Non-host Plants and its Implication for Pest Management	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						"Bruchidae; host selection; insect behavior; legume; neoplasm; Pisum sativum; pea weevil"	"PISUM-SATIVUM; L COLEOPTERA; NEOPLASTIC POD; SURFACE WAX; BRUCHIDAE; FIELD; RESISTANCE; STRATEGIES; ETHIOPIA; INSECTS"	The pea weevil, Bruchus pisorum L. is a major insect pest of field pea, Pisum sativum L. worldwide and current control practices mainly depend on the use of chemical insecticides that can cause adverse effects on environment and human health. Insecticides are also unaffordable by many small-scale farmers in developing countries, which highlights the need for investigating plant resistance traits and to develop alternative pest management strategies. The aim of this study was to determine oviposition preference of pea weevil among P sativum genotypes with different level of resistance (Adet, 32410-1 and 235899-1) and the non-host leguminous plants wild pea (Pisum fulvum Sibth. et Sm.) and grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.), in no-choice and dual-choice tests. Pod thickness and micromorphological traits of the pods were also examined. In the no choice tests significantly more eggs were laid on the susceptible genotype Adet than on the other genotypes. Very few eggs were laid on P. fulvum and L. sativus. In the dual-choice experiments Adet was preferred by the females for oviposition. Furthermore, combinations of Adet with either 235899-1 or non-host plants significantly reduced the total number of eggs laid by the weevil in the dual choice tests. Female pea weevils were also found to discriminate between host and non-host plants during oviposition. The neoplasm (Np) formation on 235899-1 pods was negatively correlated with oviposition by pea weevil. Pod wall thickness and trichomes might have influenced oviposition preference of the weevils. These results on oviposition behavior of the weevils can be used in developing alternative pest management strategies such as trap cropping using highly attractive genotype and intercropping with the non-host plants.

Phosphorus uptake and utilization efficiency in West African pearl millet inbred lines	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Pearl millet; Phosphorus; Phosphorus uptake efficiency; Phosphorus utilization efficiency; West Africa"	"P-UPTAKE EFFICIENCY; GENOTYPIC VARIATION; ROOT ARCHITECTURE; DROUGHT TOLERANCE; SOIL-PHOSPHORUS; ACQUISITION; RESPONSES; RICE; TRAITS; WHEAT"	Pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br] production on the acid sandy Sahelian soils in West Africa (WA) is severely limited bylaw plant-available phosphorus (P) in addition to erratic rainfall. We sought to examine the genetic variability for P uptake and P utilization efficiency in 180 WA pearl millet inbred lines or subsets thereof under low (LP) and high P (HP) conditions in one field and two pot experiments, determine the relationships among the measured traits and grain yield under field conditions at three other independent WA sites, and identify potential secondary selection traits for improving grain yield under LP. We observed genetic variation for P uptake and utilization in both seedling and mature plants. P utilization efficiency increased under LP conditions. Total P uptake was more important for grain production than P utilization under LP field conditions (r = 0.57*** vs r = 0.30***). The estimated response to indirect selection was positive for most of the measured morphological and P-efficiency parameters. We conclude that both seedling and mature plant traits are potentially useful as secondary traits in selection of pearl millet for low-P adaptation. These results should be validated using heterozygous pearl millet genetic materials. Ultimately, pearl millet breeding activities for low P tolerance in WA should be integrated with other system-oriented research such as nutrient cycling, intercropping or rotations with legumes, better crop-tree-livestock integration, and modest applications of locally available rock phosphate.

To comprehend the effects of cropping systems on the radiation use efficiency (RUE) in wheat-cotton double cropping, field experiments involved four cropping systems, namely monoculture cotton (MC), wheat/intercropped cotton (W/IC), wheat/transplanted cotton (W/TC) and wheat/direct-seeded cotton (W/DC) and two cotton cultivars were conducted in 2011/2012 and 2012/2013. The results showed that wheat-cotton double cropping improved radiation use by increasing the intercepted photosynthetically active radiation and RUE compared with monoculture cotton. Averaged over two years, the RUE of monoculture cotton was 1.20 g DM MJ(-1) for Siza 3 and 1.14 g DM MJ(-1) for CCRI 50, while that of double cropped cotton was 1.19-1.93 g DM MJ(-1) higher than monoculture cotton, with the RUE of cotton in W/DC was the highest, followed by in W/TC and W/IC. The analysis of cropping systems effects on cotton canopy structure and light distribution indicated that the high RUE was associated with the favorable intra-canopy light distribution. Cotton in W/IC, W/TC and W/DC system intercepted 87.1%, 54.6% and 44.3% as much PAR as the monoculture cotton for Siza 3 and 86.9%, 59.3% and 46.2% as much PAR as the monoculture cotton for CCRI 50, respectively. Double cropping cotton intercepted significantly lower PAR than monoculture cotton, which is the result of the lower fPAR caused by initiation shading for IC, later planting for TC and delayed sowing for DC, respectively. Our results suggest that the key factor that limits cotton production in double cropping systems is their lower PAR interception rather than the RUE. Suggestions for further increasing the productivity of radiation should be based on improved capture of radiation by cotton in wheat-cotton double cropping systems. The early maturity cultivar might be more appropriate to double cropping sequential systems. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that intercropping could promote P cycling, through microbial biomass P (MBP) changes, in a field trial in a Mediterranean climate. Changes in microbial biomass carbon (MBC), MBP, and inorganic P availability in the rhizosphere of intercropped species were thus investigated in durum wheat/chickpea and durum wheat/lentil intercrops and compared to the bulk soils as well as the rhizosphere of each species grown alone. When expressed relative to the bulk soil, MBC increased in the rhizosphere only for the intercropped plants, irrespective of species. Relative to MBC in the rhizosphere of sole crops, MBC increased in the rhizosphere of the two legume species when intercropped with durum wheat, while no such effect was found for durum wheat. We were unable to detect an increase in P availability in the rhizosphere as a response to intercropping in any of the three crop species, but there was a systematic increase in available P in the rhizosphere relative to the corresponding bulk soil. Fairly similar patterns were observed for MBP as for MBC, except within the rhizosphere of durum wheat when intercropped with chickpea: relative to the bulk soil, MBP increased in the rhizosphere of both lentil and chickpea when intercropped with durum wheat as well as in the rhizosphere of durum wheat when intercropped with chickpea. The differences in microbial biomass changes for a given cereal (durum wheat) when intercropped with two different legumes, suggest that plants have strong species-specific influences on each other as well as on the soil environment. The molar ratios of MBC to MBP (MM C:P) did not vary significantly except for the rhizosphere of durum wheat intercropped with chickpea, which was fairly low (16:1), about half the values found in the other treatments (26-40:1). These MM C:P values were lower than those generally reported in soils (38-60:1), verifying the hypothesis that microbes can increase storage of soil Pin their biomass, creating stocks of microbial P in the soil when P availability is high. In this Mediterranean climate where surface soils undergo frequent drying-rewetting, known for liberation of microbial biomass, MBP could be an important factor influencing P availability. Together, our data demonstrate the importance of intercropping to soil P cycling and highlight the need to examine the rhizosphere of each intercropped species to truly understand how the soil P resource is shared in such agroecosystems.

A better understanding of the biotic and abiotic factors determining interactions between plants in such associations is required. Our study aimed to analyse the effect of earthworms on the legume-cereal interactions with a focus on the modifications induced by earthworms on the forms of soil phosphorus (P). In a glasshouse experiment we investigated the effect of an endogeic earthworm (Allolobophora chlorotica) on the plant biomass and on N and P acquisition by durum wheat (Triticum turgidum durum L.) and chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) either grown alone or intercropped. The modifications of the different organic and inorganic P forms in the bulk soil were measured. There was no overyielding of the intercrop in the absence of earthworms. Earthworms had a strong influence on biomass and resource allocation between roots and shoots whereas no modification was observed in terms of total biomass production and P acquisition. Earthworms changed the interaction between the intercropped species mainly by reducing the competition for nutrients. Facilitation (positive plant-plant interactions) was only observed for the root biomass and P acquisition in the presence of earthworms. Earthworms decreased the amount of organic P extracted with NaOH (Po NaOH), while they increased the water soluble inorganic P (Pi H2O) content. In this experiment, earthworms could be seen as troubleshooter in plant-plant interaction as they reduced the competition between the intercropped species.

A review	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Review						"Agroecosystem service; Breeding; Composite cross population; Cultivar mixture; Evolutionary breeding; Intercropping; Living mulch; Low input; Organic farming; Trait"	"QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; NITROGEN-USE EFFICIENCY; WINTER-WHEAT; GRAIN-YIELD; CULTIVAR MIXTURES; COMPETITIVE ABILITY; ECOLOGICAL INTENSIFICATION; GENETIC DIVERSITY; CROPPING SYSTEMS; INTERGENOTYPIC COMPETITION"	Agrobiodiversity can improve the sustainability of cropping systems in a context of low external inputs and unpredictable climate change. Agrobiodiversity strategies to grow wheat are breeding ad hoc cultivars for organic and low-input systems, wheat-legume intercrops and living mulches, cultivar mixtures, and the use of genetically heterogeneous populations. However, applying those strategies can fail due the lack of a well-focused framework. Therefore, we need a better integration between breeding and management and a clear focus on crop traits related to key agroecosystem services. Here, we review the use of agrobiodiversity in wheat production, focusing on breeding and management. We discuss five agroecosystem services: (1) weed reduction, (2) nitrogen use efficiency, (3) abiotic stress tolerance, (4) disease and pest reduction and (5) yield and yield stability. We categorise agrobiodiversity into functional identity, functional composition, and functional diversity, in order to link crop traits to agroecosystem services. Linking crop traits to agroecosystem services could in turn lead to concrete options for farmers and policy. We discuss the relations between crop identity and crop heterogeneity. We also discuss the partitioning of crop heterogeneity between functional composition and functional diversity.

Influence of Fertilizer Microdosing on Strigolactone Production and Striga hermonthica Parasitism in Pearl Millet	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						"Pearl millet; Strigolactones; Striga hermonthica; Diammonium phosphate"	"SORGHUM-BICOLOR; INFESTATION; RESISTANCE; ATTACHMENT; CULTIVARS; AFRICA"	"Parasitism by the root-parasitic plant, Striga (Striga hermonthica L.), is a main threat to pearl millet production in sub-Saharan Africa and nutrient deficiency aggravates this problem, often leading to complete failure of pearl millet crops. Like many other species, pearl millet secretes germination stimulants (strigolactones) into the soil in response to mineral nutrient deficiency, which triggers Striga seed germination resulting in infection. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of different doses of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) fertilizer on strigolactone production and Striga infection in three different African pearl millet cultivars (KBH, Sadore Local and Striga resistance). All the pearl millet genotypes produced varying amounts of different strigolactones like orobanchol, epi-orobanchol, orobanchyl acetate and 5-deoxystrigol, the level of which decreases with increasing doses of DAP. The control treatment (no DAP) showed maximum Striga germination, emergence and dry biomass production in all cultivars of pearl millet. Supply of DAP fertilizer up to 4 g per hill suppressed Striga germination by 69, 64 and 59%; emergence by 87, 85 and 95% and dry biomass by 91, 98 and 83% in cvs KBH, Sadore Local and Striga Resistance, respectively. The present findings reveal that DAP fertilizer minimizes strigolactones production and, as a result, reduces Striga infection in pearl millet. Low doses of DAP fertilizer is a promising strategy to lower the destructive effect of Striga on pearl millet. The use of small doses of DAP fertilizer combined with resistant crop cultivars, intercropping with legumes and hand pulling of Striga at flowering in an integrated Striga control strategy should be developed to help African farmers control this noxious weed.

Randomized block design with three replications was followed to study the performance of sole and intercrops of legumes [Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), Pea (Pisum sativum L.), Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L), Lentil (Lens esculenta Moench)] with baby corn (Zea mays L.) in 2:1 (one row of legume planted in between of baby corn rows) and 2:2 (two rows of legume planted in between of baby corn rows) additive series system. Effects on weed communities were characterized in terms of growth and species diversity (richness and evenness). The greater the crop biomass, the higher the weed suppression was. Sole baby corn was densely populated by weeds and also had higher weed biomass. Nonetheless, intercrops suppress weeds growth and population more than their respective sole crop. The intercropping systems of pea or chickpea with baby corn were most suppressive of weeds. Weed diversity and evenness were higher in intercropping systems. The 2:2 row arrangement appeared to be the most weed competitive row arrangement. Intercropping of legumes suppressed the emergence of the most troublesome weeds in the study.

The aim of this study was to describe the vertical and horizontal distribution of the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover, within the cotton plant (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in cotton with colored fibers and cotton-fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Miller) intercropping system over time, during two cotton seasons. Measurements of the aphid population's dynamics and distribution in the cotton plants were recorded at intervals of 7 d, from plant emergence until the appearance of the first open bolls. The number of aphids and their specific locations on the plant were recorded in relation to reference points (nodes on the plant's main stem as well as on leaves and fruit structures). The number of cotton aphids found on the cotton crop (11,444 cotton aphids) was significantly higher than the number found on the cotton-fennel intercrop (8,106). Considering the vertical distribution of cotton aphids on the plants, no significant interactions were observed among the crop system, plant age and plant region, between the crop system and plant age, or between the crop system and plant region. In the cotton system, aphid populations peaked between 74 and 95 d, whereas in the cotton-fennel intercropping system, aphid populations peaked between 74 and 102 d. The results obtained in this study could be useful in decision-making, implementing controls and determining the timing of population peaks of this aphid.	"[Fernandes, F. S.; Ramalho, F.

Glyphosate-resistant soybeans (GRS) are being cultivated in most of the soybean area in South America. Overall, the GRS system is beneficial to the environment when compared to conventional soybean. GRS resulted in a significant shift toward no-tillage practices in Brazil and Argentina, but weed resistance may reduce this trend. Probably the highest agricultural risk in adopting GRS in Brazil and South America is related to weed resistance due to use of glyphosate. Weed species in GRS fields have shifted in Brazil to those that can more successfully withstand glyphosate or to those that avoid the time of its application. Five weed species, in order of importance, Conyza bonariensis (L.) Cronquist, Conyza canadensis (L.) Cronquist, Lolium multiflorum Lam., Digitaria insularis (L.) Mez ex Ekman, and Euphorbia heterophylla L., have evolved resistance to glyphosate in GRS in Brazil. Conyza spp. are the most difficult to control. A glyphosate-resistant biotype of Sorghum halepense L. has evolved in GRS in Argentina and one of D. insularis in Paraguay. The following actions are proposed to minimize weed resistance problem: (a) rotation of GRS with conventional soybeans in order to rotate herbicide modes of action; (b) avoidance of lower than recommended glyphosate rates; (c) keeping soil covered with a crop or legume at intercrop intervals; (d) keeping machinery free of weed seeds; and (d) use of a preplant nonselective herbicide plus residuals to eliminate early weed interference with the crop and to minimize escapes from later applications of glyphosate due to natural resistance of older weeds and/or incomplete glyphosate coverage."

The density of pest insects was higher in mono-cultured plots than in intercropping plots. Two cultivars of cabbage were also significantly different in pest incidence, with less dense pests in Shoshu. However, the damage index was not exactly consistent to pest inset density. 'Shinshu 868' in mono-cultured plots with the highest density of insects showed the lowest PDI of 36.0, while 'Shoshu' in relay-intercropping plots with the lowest density of insects showed the highest PDI of 58.8. It was concluded that relay-intercropping of cabbage into tomato decreased the level of pest incidence in the cabbage crop. It was speculatively suggested that shelter by tomato plants to cabbage might have prevented adult insects from laying eggs on the cabbage plants and consequently decreased the insect density."

No significant differences were found between GM and F+GM with respect to herb and oil yield of menthol mint and succeeding palmarosa crop and nitrogen economy. Fresh biomass yield of menthol mint increased by 23.4% and essential oil yield by 25.2% by cowpea green manure(mean of GM and F+GM)as compared to without GM across all N levels. The contribution of green manure, as a nitrogen source, was equivalent to 30 kg N ha-1 when no fertilizer nitrogen was applied in menthol mint. The residual effect of cowpea GM was studied in a succeeding crop of fast growing essential oil yielding palmarosa (Cymbopopogon martinii (Roxb.)Wats. var motia Burk.) over two harvests (July and December). Averaged across N levels green manure resulted in an increase of 18.5% in the fresh biomass and 17.7% in essential oil yield of palmarosa over no green manuring. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

All aqueous extracts at all concentrations inhibited seed germination, seedling growth, water uptake and lipase activity of soybean and chive compared with the control, and the degree of inhibition increased with the incremental extracts concentration. The degree of toxicity of different ginger plant parts can be classified in order of decreasing inhibition as stem > leaf > rhizome. The results of this study suggest that rhizome, stem and leaf of ginger contain water-soluble allelochemicals which could inhibit seed germination and seedling growth of soybean and chive. The rhizome is the main harvested part of ginger. The residue (mainly stems and leaves) of the ginger plant should be removed from the field so as to diminish its inhibitory effect. Further work is needed to specify and verify the allelochemicals produced by this plant. The results of this study suggest that ginger allelochemicals are heterotoxic, and thus intercropping should not be practiced using ginger. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Intercropping strategies are known to maximize growth and productivity by including more than one species in the crop stand, very often with legumes as one of the components. In the present study clover-grass is undersown in a traditional wheat crop. Thereby, it is possible to increase input of symbiotic fixation of atmospheric nitrogen into the cropping systems and reduce the need for fertilizer applications. Furthermore, when using such wheat and clover-grass mixtures as raw material, addition of urea and other fermentation nutrients produced from fossil fuels can be reduced in the whole ethanol manufacturing chain. Using second generation ethanol technology mixtures of relative proportions of wheat straw and clover-grass (15:85, 50:50, and 85:15) were pretreated by wet oxidation. The results showed that supplementing wheat straw with clover-grass had a positive effect on the ethanol yield in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation experiments, and the effect was more pronounced in inhibitory substrates. The highest ethanol yield (80% of theoretical) was obtained in the experiment with high fraction (85%) of clover-grass. In order to improve the sugar recovery of clover-grass, it should be separated into a green juice (containing free sugars, fructan, amino acids, vitamins and soluble minerals) for direct fermentation and a fibre pulp for pretreatment together with wheat straw. Based on the obtained results a decentralized biorefinery concept for production of biofuel is suggested emphasizing sustainability, localness, and recycling principles.

This study examines the potential relationship between plant architecture and yield for a legume grown under intercropping. Field experiments were conducted in 1991 to examine the response of two cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) genotypes with contrasting plant habits to sole crop and intercrop with pearl millet (Pennisetum americanum (L.) Leeke), and to identify cowpea traits associated with yield under intercropping. The cultivar with a bush-type habit was higher-yielding in sole crop, whereas the cultivar with a spreading habit was higher-yielding in intercrop. For F-2 cowpea populations, pod number was most highly correlated with seed yield in intercrop. The number of branches and nodes, particularly in areas with increased access to light, and increased internode length were also important in intercrop. Selection for improved yield in sole crop may not necessarily lead to improved yield in intercrop, and different plant traits may be more appropriate for cultivars intended for use in intercrop than for those intended for use in sole crop.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of seeding density (30, 50, 70, and 90 thousand plants ha(-1)) and weed control on green ear yield and grain yield in corn cultivar AG 1051. A completely randomized block design was adopted with split-plots (seeding densities assigned to plots) and ten replicates. Weed control was achieved by means of two hoeings and by planting corn intercropped with gliricidia (between corn rows, in pits spaced 0.3 m apart). A no weeding treatment was included as well. Increased seeding density increased the total number and weight of marketable green ears and decreased the biomass of both weeds and gliricidia. In non-weeded, intercropped and hoed plots, the maximum grain yield values achieved as seeding density increased were 7,881, 7,021, and 9,213 kg ha(-1), respectively, obtained with populations of 67 thousand, 74 thousand, and 67 thousand plants per hectare, respectively. Intercropping did not control weeds (26 species) and provided weed growth, green ear yield, and grain yield (at the lowest densities) similar to those obtained without hoeing, except for total number of green ears, in which no influence of weed control was observed. At densities of 70 thousand and 90 thousand plants per hectare, grain yield with two hoeings was not different from yield values obtained without weeding or in the treatment intercropped with gliricidia, respectively, indicating that increased corn seeding density as well as gliricidiamay help to control weeds.

Nitrogen fertilizer treatment increased vegetative development, but application of 60 and 30 kg N ha-1 in sole and intercropping, respectively, gave maximum marketable fruit yields in each of the vegetables. Intercropping thus modified N response of the vegetables for fruit production. With cowpea, increasing nitrogen treatment also increased vegetative development; grain yield was reduced up to 55% by intercropping, but less when 30 kg N ha-1 was applied.

The experiment was conducted in the municipality of Serra Talhada, Pernambuco State, Brazil, between the years 2012 and 2013. Forage cactus was distributed in randomized blocks with factorial scheme and four replicates, in split plots (5 x 2), with five irrigation depths (0, 8.75, 17.5, 26.25 and 35% of the reference evapotranspiration, ET0) and two cropping systems (forage cactus monocropping and forage cactus sorghum intercropping). Crop evapotranspiration was calculated through soil water balance. The ratio between crop and reference evapotranspiration, and land use and water use efficiencies, were estimated. Irrigation depths and the intercropping affected only forage cactus canopy width and cladode biomass. The ratio between crop and reference evapotranspiration increased with the increase of irrigation depths, while the highest water use efficiency based on dry matter occurred at irrigation depths higher than 1,096 mm year(-1) in the intercropping (21.8 +/- 6.8 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)). Irrigation depths did not affect land use efficiency (0.83). Water depths from 1,096 to 1,202 mm year(-1) are recommended in the forage cactus sorghum system.

However, corn and grass are plants demanding in nitrogen. The corn cultivated in the dry season is called out-of-season corn in Brazil. The objective of this study was to evaluate the productivity and nutrients concentrations of out-of-season corn and Congo-grass intercropped in the no-tillage system, as a function of the nitrogen rates applied in sidedressing. The treatments were four nitrogen rates, 0, 30, 60 and 90kgha(-1). The experimental design was randomised complete blocks with four replicates. The experimental period corresponded to the harvests of 2015 and 2016. There were evaluated: corn grain yield, dry mass production and nutrient concentration in the shoots of the plants intercropped. The evaluations were carried out at the physiological maturity stage of the corn and at the time of desiccation of the grass. Nitrogen increased grain yield and dry mass production of the plants intercropped. Nitrogen maximised the magnesium concentration in out-of-season corn and the nitrogen, calcium, magnesium and sulphur concentrations in Congo grass. Excess nitrogen promoted reduction of the phosphorus in the Corn-Congo grass intercropping system in the dry season.

Cultivars AG 1051, BM 2022, and BM 3061, assigned to plots, were submitted to the following treatments: no hoeing, two hoeings (at 20 and 40 days after sowing), and intercropped with gliricidia sown at densities of 10 and 20 seeds m(-2). Thirty weed species occurred in the experiment area, with Cucumis anguria as the most frequent ones. Cultivar BM 2022 was the best for the total number of ears (TNE) and number (NMHE) and weight of marketable husked ears. Together with cultivar AG 1051, this cultivar had the highest total weight and marketable unhusked ear weight (MUEW). However, the cultivars did not differ with respect to grain yield (GY). The highest green ear and corn grain yield and weed control percentages were obtained with two hoeings; in MUEW, NMHE and GY, intercropping provided intermediate means in comparison with those obtained in hoed and non-hoed plots, indicating that gliricidia was partially beneficial to corn. Increased gliricidia seeding density heightened the benefits to corn (TNE and MUEW). The lack of hoeing produced the poorest green ear and grain yields."	"[Oliveira, A.

Sub -plots comprised inter crop combinations, SS (sole), C (sole), B (sole), SC (intercrop) and SB (intercrop). Data collected included soil water content (SWC), plant height (PH)/vine length, leaf number (LN), tillering (T)/branching, leaf area index (LAI), relative leaf water content (RWC), stomatal conductance (gs) and chlorophyll content index (CCI) as well as biomass accumulation and partitioning. Yield and yield components, water use (WU) and WUE for grain (WUEg) were calculated at harvest. Land equivalent ratio (LER) was used to evaluate productivity of the intercrop. Sorghum canopy size decreased (P<0.05) (-6.7%, -10.6%, -89% and -79% for PH, LN, T and LAI, respectively) with decreasing water availability.. Sorghum growth and development were unaffected by intercropping. Intercropping sorghum with cowpea improved gs (23%) and CCI (6.56%) of sorghum under low water availability. Productivity of sorghum across varying water regimes and cropping systems was stable with final biomass, yield and harvest index of 2.4 t ha(-1), 0.98 t ha(-1) and 35%, respectively. Overall, LER showed a 46% increase in productivity across all intercrop systems. Intercropping marginally increased WU (5.64%). Improvements of WUEg were observed under SC and SB (54.65% and 46.98%, respectively) relative to SS. Intercropping sorghum with cowpea is recommended for semi-and arid environments since it promoted efficient use of water. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	"[Chimonyo, V. G. P.; Modi, A.

Family farmers and biodiesel production: Systems thinking and multi-level decisions in Northern Minas Gerais, Brazil	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						"Bayesian network modelling; Biodiesel; Expert opinion; Family farming; Social inclusion; Systems thinking"	"BAYESIAN NETWORKS; POLICY; SUSTAINABILITY; ARRANGEMENTS; FUEL; FOOD"	"This study focuses on family farmer engagement in the Brazilian national programme for Production and use of Biodiesel (PNPB). The Brazilian government has been promoting the role of family farmers as producers of biomass for biodiesel since 2004; however, fewer than expected family farmers have decided to produce biomass for biodiesel. The North of Minas Gerais is one region where a biodiesel plant has been strategically located to source castor beans grown by family farmers. The target family farm type in this region specializes in beef and/or dairy production with low input pasture (approximately 30 ha per farm), maize intercropped with beans (approximately 1 ha per farm) and sugarcane (approximately 1 ha per farm). We selected this region for a case study to explore management decisions of farmers, industry and policy makers that influence family farmer engagement with biodiesel production through cultivation of castor beans. To evaluate outcomes for family farmers engaging with the PNPB, we focused on how cultivation of castor beans impacts family farmers in terms of income levels, income stability and levels of milk production. We used an application of systems thinking known as Bayesian network modelling (BNM). BNM was chosen for its suitability to integrate different types of knowledge and to include quantitative and qualitative variables. The study was built on a body of scientific literature explaining why family farmers have not been cultivating castor beans for biodiesel production and a body of experiential knowledge of local actors (farmers, extension officers, policy makers, biodiesel manufacturers and researchers in North of Minas Gerais). The complete BNM consisted of a 'cause and effect' diagram where the strengths of the causal relationships were quantified with elicited opinions from surveyed local actors. We used the complete BNM to explore scenarios that could improve outcomes for family farmers and consequently increase their level of engagement. For example, we addressed subsidy structures of the PNPB, crop management, farm-level trade-offs and value-chain innovations. We demonstrate that decisions to support family farmer engagement with biodiesel are not singular. Engagement by family farmers requires simultaneously: improvements in technical crop management, reductions in farm-level cash constraints and innovations in the production chain such that engagement of family farmers goes beyond cultivation of one more low-value crop. Finally we discuss some methodological issues from this application of BNM to farming systems research. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Soil Mulching With gliricidia (Gliricidia. sepium) branches does riot have an allelopathic effect on corn, but decreases weed populations. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of gliricidia planting density, when grown as an intercrop, on weed control and corn yield parameters. A randomized block design with split-plots and ten replicates was adopted. Corn cultivars AG 1051 and BM 3061 were grown without hoeing, with two hoes (at 24 and 44 (lays after planting), and intercropped with gliricidia (planted simultaneously with corn, between crop rows, using two seedlings/pit. spaced at 30, 40, or 50 cm). Twenty-one weed species were found in the experimental area. Increased gliricidia planting density reduced weed biomass, but no difference was found between weed biomass in the intercrop and weed biomass in non-hoed corn. Gliricidia intercropped with corn, planted at a row spacing of 30 cm, did not significantly differ from hoed corn in most. characteristics considered to evaluate green corn yield, although mean values were smaller. As to the number and weight of marketable green cars, reductions of 5% and 13%, respectively. were observed. Intercropping caused a 17% reduction in grain yield, reducing the losses (36%) observed in non-hoed corn by more than 50%. The highest green ear yield and grain yield values were obtained with two hoeings, while the lowest values were observed for non-hoed corn. The cultivars did riot differ regarding green car yield and grain yield.	"[Silva, P. S. L.; Oliveira, O. F.; Oliveira, F. H. T.; Torres, S.

To select appropriate species for intercropping, experiments were conducted in the savannah zone of Cote d'Ivoire during the wet seasons of 1997 and 1998 to determine the growth and nitrogen (N) accumulation of six cover legumes as well as the characteristics indicative of competitive ability. The species included the erect growing Crotalaria juncea and Cajanus cajan, the creeping species Mucuna pruriens var. cochinchinensis and Calopogonium mucunoides and the bushy herbaceous species Aeschynomene histrix and Stylosanthes hamata. Marked differences in phenology were observed as S. hamata and C. juncea flowered around 45-55 days after sowing (DAS) and the other species around 80-95 DAS. C. juncea and C. cajan produced close to 9 ton dry matter ha(-1), whereas the other species produced less than half this amount. The average estimated amount of accumulated N, based on leaf material, was around 70 kg ha(-1) for all species except S. hamata and A. histrix, which only produced around 25 kg ha(-1). Based on morphological characteristics, C. juncea, C. cajan and the short-lived M. pruriens were identified as potentially most competitive, indicating that productivity and competitive ability are strongly linked. The implications of these findings for intercropping systems in upland rice production are discussed.

A field study was conducted to determine the optimal planting time for corn as a relay crop in a flue-cured tobacco system to obtain high corn productivity and ensure the quality and yield of tobacco. Four relay-intercropping planting dates (10, 17, 24, and 31 d after tobacco apex excision) and corn monoculture (17 d after tobacco apex excision) were evaluated on the incidence and severity index of diseases and yield of corn at Chuxiong, Yunnan, China in 2010 and 2011. The incidence and severity index of corn common rust (Puccinia sorghi) were reduced 60.3 to 67.8% and 69.2 to 78.9%, respectively, by relay intercropping compared with monoculture corn. Grain yield, economic value, land equivalency ratio (LER), and relative value total (RVT) of relay-intercropped corn and the net return of the whole relay-intercropping system generally decreased when the relay-intercropping timing of corn was delayed. All LER values and some of the RVT values for relay-intercropped corn were >1. Net return of the whole tobacco and corn relay-intercropping system was 18.5 to 21.0 times greater than that under monoculture corn. Relay-intercropped corn after flue-cured tobacco is an economically viable cropping system in Yunnan and similar regions, with an optimal relay-intercropping date between 10 and 17 d after tobacco apex excision.

However, growing of two or more crops as an intercrop is not business as usual but it needs extensive knowledge about the nature of component crops to grow in harmony. Hence selection and evaluation of compatible legume species for intercropping with finger millet in the study area is necessary. Materials and methods: A field experiment was conducted at two major finger millet producing areas of northwestern Ethiopia. Four legumes crops such as (sweet lupine, cowpea, haricot bean, and soybean) intercropped with finger millet. Results: The analysis of variance showed that intercropping of finger millet with different legumes had yield advantage in both districts as compared to component crops. Land equivalent ratio was more than unity for all treatments in both districts except for finger millet intercropped with soybean at South Achefer district. At Guangua finger millet + cowpea and finger millet + soybean showed 27% and 12% yield advantage, respectively and also finger millet + cowpea preferred first by farmers for its high grain yield, soil fertility improvement and its suitability for animal feed. At South Achefer finger millet + sweet lupine and finger millet + cowpea showed 38% and 35% yield advantage respectively and also finger millet + sweet lupine preferred first by farmers for its high grain yield to make stew as a protein source, soil fertility improvement and its suitability for human and animal feed. Conclusion: Therefore intercropping, finger millet + cowpea and finger millet + soybean at Guangua and finger millet + sweet lupine and finger millet + cowpea at South Achefer preferred by farmers and also had yield advantage as compared to component crops. Hence finger millet + cowpea and finger millet + soybean recommended for Guangua and similar agro-ecologies and finger millet + sweet lupine and finger millet + cowpea for South Achefer and similar agro-ecologies as 1st, 2nd option respectively.

However, knowledge is restricted on the relevance of different nutrient transfer pathways. The objective of the study was to quantify nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) transfer from peas to triticale by (1) direct root contact (=R), (2) arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF;=A), and (3) diffusion (=D). Pea (Pisum sativum cv. Frisson and P2) and triticale (TriticumxSecale cv. Benetto) plants as intercrop were grown for 105 days. Treatment ADR enabled all transfer paths between the two crops. Treatment AD with root exclusion enabled AMF and diffusion transfer between peas and triticale. Treatment A with a diffusion gap barrier only allowed AMF transfer. Pea plants were labelled every 14 days with a C-13 glucose and N-15 urea solution, using the cotton wick technique. Direct root contact resulted in the highest pea rhizodeposition and thus the largest absolute amounts of N and C transfer to triticale. Root exclusion generally changed composition of rhizodeposits from fine root residues towards root exudates. Pea plant-N consisted of 17% N derived from rhizodeposition (NdfR) in treatment ADR but only 8% in the treatments AD and A, independently of pea variety, whereas pea plant-C consisted of 13% C derived from rhizodeposition (CdfR), without pea variety and transfer path treatment effects. Averaging all transfer path treatments, 6.7% of NdfR and 2.7% of CdfR was transferred from Frisson and P2 to triticale plants. Approximately 90% of this NdfR was transferred by direct root contact from Frisson to triticale and only 10% by AMF, whereas only 55% of CdfR was transferred to triticale by direct root contact, 40% by AMF and 5% by diffusion. Similar percentages were transferred from mutant P2 to triticale. Root exclusion generally changed RD composition from fine root residues towards root exudates."

We therefore conducted a laboratory experiments to study the effects of ionic Ti application on morphology, growth, biomass distribution, chlorophyll fluorescence performance and Rubisco activity of soybean (Glycine max L.) under normal light (NL) and shade conditions (SC). In this study, we sprayed soybean plants with five different levels of ionic Ti (T1 = 0, T2 = 1.25, T3 = 2.5, T4 = 5 and T5 = 10 mg Ti Plant(-1)) through foliar application method.

Moreover, Rubisco activity was at peak (55 and 6% increase under NL and SC) at 2.5 mg Ti Plant and decreased with increasing Ti concentration, reaching the lowest at 10 mg Ti Plant(-1), which indicates that leaf cells were damaged as observed in the leaf anatomy. We concluded that ionic Ti expresses a hormesis effect: at lower concentrations, promoting soybean growth, however, at higher concentrations, suppressing soybean growth both under NL and SC. We therefore suggest that under different light stress conditions, Ti application could serve to mitigate abiotic stresses, especially in intercropping systems. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V."

Alternatively, semiochemical substances have been tested to enhance biological control, with inconsistent results. Combining both strategies can be an interesting way to maximize pest control. In this work, a 2-year setup involving wheat-pea strip intercropping combined with the release of E-beta-farnesene (EBF) or methyl salicylate (MeSA) was tested as a push-pull strategy to simultaneously repel aphids and attract beneficials. Two types of slow-release formulation (i.e., oil and alginate beads) containing EBF or MeSA were deployed with the intercropping. The abundance of aphids was significantly decreased, while hoverfly larvae and mummified aphids increased on both pea plants and wheat tillers by the release of oil-formulated EBF and MeSA. The proportion parasitism of the aphid-parasitism rate [mummies/(aphids + mummies)] was also increased by treating both crops in both years. Releasing EBF through oil rather than alginate beads proved significantly better for attracting natural enemies and reducing aphids. Aphids were negatively correlated with the density of hoverflies (both adults and larvae) and numbers of mummies. All these results showed that combining intercropping with the release of EBF or MeSA formulated in oil can significantly reduce aphid density and attract their natural enemies. Therefore, the combination of both strategies could help farmers reduce the use of insecticides.

Vegetation indices based solely on visible reflectance, which can be derived from true colour images may be a simple and cheap alternative compared to near infrared indices. A remote-controlled hexacopter with an RGB digital camera was tested for evaluating crop biomass. The hexacopter was flown over a field in which peas and oats were grown as sole crops and intercrops, fertilised with horse manure and yard-waste compost (10 t C ha(-1)). The images were taken at flowering stage. Based on the aerial photographs, the Normalised Green-Red Difference Index (NGRDI) was calculated, and related to aboveground biomass and leaf area index (LAI). The mean of NGRDI values ranged from 0.09 to 0.13 without any effect of cropping system, while the fertiliser significantly affected the yield and the corresponding NGRDI values. NGRDI values were positively and significantly correlated with the aboveground biomass (r = 0.58-0.78). A high autocorrelation of NGRDI, and thus biomass, was found within the treatment plots and used for block kriging to show the spatial variability in the field. No relationship was found between NGRDI and LAI in peas (P = 0.68) or oats (P = 0.15). Nevertheless, true colour images from a hexacopter and the derived NGRDI values are a cost-effective tool for biomass estimation and the establishment of yield variation maps for site-specific agricultural decision making.

The experiment was conducted under field conditions in Botucatu, Sao Paulo. The experimental design was of randomized blocks with four replications, in a factorial design consisting of two managements of shoot phytomass (with and without mechanical fragmentation) at six harvesting times [0, 18, 32, 46, 74 and 91 days after management (DAM)]. The dry-matter weight, macronutrient and Si content, and quantity of remaining nutrients were determined. The data were subjected to variance analysis, the averages of the factor management treatments were compared by t-test (LSD) at 5%, and those of the factor sampling-times, adjusted to the mathematical equations. Fragmentation of the phytomass increases the rate of decomposition and release of N, P, Ca and S. K is available quickly, with on average 1.5% of the total amount accumulated at 91 DAM. By 91 DAM at least 80% of all the macronutrients had been released into the soil. The maximum daily release of macronutrients occurs between 0 to 18 DAM. The release rate of Si is constant, and there is an increase of the content of this element in the phytomass over time, due to the marked release of C. The element Si is that released most slowly into the soil, with there still being present at DAM 91 on average 85% of the total amount accumulated in the phytomass.

Poir] appears to hold promise as a cool-season legume option for the south-central United States. A 2-yr field study at two locations in Louisiana was conducted to evaluate forage dry matter (DM) production and nutritive value of an oat (Avena sativa L.)- field pea combination and an annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.)-field pea combination at different field pea seeding rates. Monocultures of the grasses at a range of N fertilizer rates were included for comparison. Increasing seeding rates of field pea increased forage DM production linearly (P < 0.05) and linearly (P < 0.01) increased crude protein from forage of interseeded plantings. Interseeding field pea did not improve in vitro true digestibility of oat-field pea or annual ryegrass-field pea forage at either harvest, even though the annual grasses maintained a similar high digestibility to field pea only at the first harvest. Nitrogen fertilizer, which produced a linear increase in forage production with increasing N rate, provides more flexibility and easier management than the use of legumes. Cost of N will determine when the use of legumes such as field pea is a preferred option. The improved forage nutritive value of interseeded field pea can be a meaningful benefit with specific classes of livestock and production goals.	"[Han, K. J.; McCormick, M.

Yield and Weed Suppression of Crop Mixtures in Organic and Conventional Systems of the Western Canadian Prairie	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							"FIELD PEA INTERCROP; CENTRAL ALBERTA; BARLEY; GROWTH; PLANT; COMPETITION; MANAGEMENT; DENSITY; WHEAT; MONOCULTURE"	To investigate intercropping as a management strategy to increase crop productivity and weed suppression in organic systems, spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), canola (Brassica napus L.) and field pea (Pisum sativum L.) monocultures were compared with two-, three-, and four-crop intercrops containing wheat at two organic and one conventional site in 2006 and 2007, central Alberta, Canada. We measured crop and weed biomass, grain yield, and crop competitiveness against weeds from a replacement design in a completely randomized block experiment. Pea and canola monocrops on organic sites yielded the least of all crop treatments. Conventional crop treatments generally yielded higher than organic treatments. Few land equivalent ratios (LERs) on organic sites were significantly >1.0. Some wheat intercrops without barley showed overyielding (LER > 1.0) potential. Most of the significant LERs were from three- and four-crop intercrops. More than 50% of the intercrops on organic sites significantly suppressed weeds (based on relative weed biomass) and most of these intercrops had barley in the mixture. Barley as a sole crop and in intercrops suppressed weeds better than all other intercrops and sole crops. The wheat-canola intercrop exhibited the best weed suppression of the two-crop intercrops on organic and conventional sites. The crop densities used in this study may have contributed to the extremely low pea and canola monocrop yields as well as low LERs. Due to this, our findings should be regarded as showing trends and potential from intercrops only. We therefore recommend further studies to establish ideal densities for the intercrops used.

The objective of this study was to investigate intercropping complementarity of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), canola (Brassica napus L.), and field pea (Pisum arvense L.) for light and water use. Sole crop and intercrop combinations were evaluated for effects on land equivalent ratios (LERs), canopy light interception, soil moisture, water use (WU), and water use efficiency (WUE), with or without in-crop herbicides at two field sites in Manitoba, Canada. The mean LER was 1.1, but LERs varied greatly between site-years and herbicide treatments, and were significantly greater than one in 22% of the site-year-treatment combinations. The wheat-canola-pea and canola-pea intercrops showed the greatest frequency of overyielding for dry matter (50%) and grain yield (38%), respectively. Peak light interception tended to occur earlier with canola than with field pea, thus increasing the potential for light use complementarity between these crops. There was a positive correlation between LER and light interception in half of the site-years with applied herbicides and a negative correlation between LER and weed biomass at most site-years without herbicides. Although crop treatments used water differently within the soil profile, there were no differences in WU, but some differences in WUE, between crop treatments; however, WUE generally was not greater in intercrops compared to sole crops. In this study, overyielding in intercrops was inconsistent, and seemed to be related more to light interception than to water utilization."

Intercropping red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) with winter cereal grains can provide forage and a green manure crop. Seeding rate recommendations for sole crops may not optimize intercrop system productivity if interactions exist. This study was conducted during the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 growing seasons to determine optimum cereal grain and red clover forage seeding rates for maximum returns using partial budget analyses. In March, red clover was frost-seeded at 0, 300, 600,900, 1200, and 1500 seeds m(-2) into winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack) seeded at 100, 200, 300, and 400 seeds m(-2) the previous October. Triticale and wheat maximized returns at seeding rates of 300 and 400 seeds m(-2). No cereal grain by red clover seeding rate interactions were detected for red clover dry matter production (DM). Red clover plant densities after cereal grain harvest were 10 to 22% of the original seeding rates.

A 9-yr study was conducted at a semiarid site at Swift Current, Saskatchewan, Canada, to determine the effects of intercropping oats (Avena sativa L.) and slender wheat-grass [Elymus trachycaulus (Link) Gould ex. Shinners] between rows of Russian wildrye [Psathyrostachys juncea (Fisch.) Nevski], and Altai wildrye [Leymus angustus (Trin) Pilger] seeded in 90-cm spacings either alone or in alternate rows with alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). Two rows of oats depressed grass forage production in the year following establishment. Slender wheatgrass intercrops reduced grass forage yield and alfalfa forage yield. However, slender wheatgrass contributed to increased total forage yields while it persisted in the mixture. By the fifth year, it had disappeared from the Russian wildrye plots but persisted 2 more years when intercropped with Altai wildrye. Interseeded companion crops, either annual or short-lived perennials, for forage will give short-term yield gains, but long-lived perennial forages may not recover from the competition in the long-term.

The results indicated that intercropping red gram (Cajanus cajan L. Millsp.) and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) in finger millet (Eleusine coracana L. Gaertn.) gave higher total grain and straw yield compared to the sole cropping of finger millet under rainfed condition of upland (Ultisols) in lateritic belt of West Bengal. Intercropping pigconpea in finger millet increased land equivalent ratio, aggressivity, relative crowding coefficient and area time equivalent ratio. Legumes were more aggressive in intercropping system and tended to have depressing effect on finger millet. Intercropping of finger millet + pigeonpea and finger millet + groundnut showed higher net return and benefit : cost ratio. Application of 60-13.3-25 kg N-P-K/ha recorded maximum productivity and the highest net return followed by the application of 30-6.7-12.5 kg N-P-K/ha.

The crops were grown on a sandy loam soil in alternate single rows typical of the husbandry practices of the area. Results indicate that different sowing dates of soyabean and cropping system affected the growth and yield of soyabean more than that of millet. Early planted soyabean yielded better than late sown soyabean although the effect of soyabean on the growth of millet was not significant (p<0.05). The land equivalent ratio (LER) for millet-soyabean intercrops were mostly greater than 1.00 indicating that the mixtures were biologically more efficient than their pure stands. Millet intercropped with soyabean gave the highest land use efficiency with early sowing dates. The implication of these findings for agriculture is that short term grown soyabean can be introduced into the cropping system to diversify and increase the present scope of the crops grown without adversely diminishing the yield of the traditionally grown millet crop. The possibility of soyabean in the cropping system can also be used to break the cycle of parasitic weed, striga when soyabean substitutes cowpea occasionally.

However, limited knowledge is available on how below-ground interspecific interaction affects yields and nutrient acquisition of crops in the intercropping. Pot experiments were carried out to facilitate the complementary induced by root interactions from below-ground in millet and mungbean intercropping. The data regarding yield, biomass, nutrient uptake, parameters of root morphology traits and photosynthesis were recorded. The experiment included three treatments: no barrier treatment (NB) allowing complete root interaction, mesh barrier (MB) of partial root interaction and solid barrier (SB) without any exchanges of water and nutrients and root interaction. The yields of millet and mungbean were increased by 53.6% and 27.8% in the treatments with complete root interactions compared to that without root interactions. Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) acquisitions of crops were 1.71, 1.97 and 1.47 times for millet, and 1.25, 1.21, and 1.19 times for mungbean in complete root interactions as high as in no root interactions, respectively. The length and surface area was increased by 52.9 and 40.6% for millet while 51.4 and 46.8% for mungbean in complete root interactions compared to that in no root interactions. The improvement of yield and nutrient acquisition may result from crop structural and functional plasticity induced from interspecific root interactions of below-ground. The results would contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the response of millet and mungbean to the root interaction on the basis of interspecific facilitation for millet/mungbean intercropping.

J	STERN, WR				STERN, WR			NITROGEN-FIXATION AND TRANSFER IN INTERCROP SYSTEMS	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article							"LEGUME; GRASS; N-15; SOIL; N-2-FIXATION; COWPEA; MAIZE"	Nitrogen, in intercropping systems that consist of legumes growing in association with another crop, is considered in terms of fixation, release, transformation, and gains and losses from the system. Methods of determining nitrogen fixation and transfer are briefly reviewed, with cautionary comments on each of these. Knowledge concerning nitrogen in the soil organic matter in intercrop systems is limited, yet it may play a more important role with respect to the nitrogen efficiency of intercrop systems, than is presently attributed to it. The success of intercrop farming systems depends initially on effective nitrogen fixation and more importantly, on subsequent transfer of nitrogen to the non-legume. While there is a good understanding of the factors concerning biological nitrogen fixation, this does not apply to transfer. A more thorough knowledge is needed of the processes involved in direct, indirect or residual nitrogen transfer from the legume to a companion or succeeding crop. Such knowledge could provide avenues for agronomic research, leading to new and more nitrogen-efficient practices. It is proposed that research concerning nitrogen in intercrop systems should be conceived within a framework of the system as a whole, and should be undertaken in the context of models that are constantly being reviewed, an iterative process. One type of model should be process-oriented. Another, more empirical model should be concerned with nitrogen balances, within segments of the whole system. Experimental work ought to be undertaken within the framework of such models, to establish sizes of pools, rates of transformations and of flows and movements of nitrogen within different parts of the system. It is suggested that the international agricultural research institutes currently involved in intercropping research are well placed to develop such models and to provide a focus for empirical research within their regions. Groups of research workers, associated in networks in different regions, should be able to contribute to a global research effort on intercropping in a coordinated way.

If FM stress occurs during the late maturation stage of soybean seed, it negatively affects seed yield and quality. To investigate the responses of soybean seed against FM stress and identify the underlying biochemical pathways involved, a greenhouse was equipped with an artificial rain producing system to allow the induction of mold growth on soybean seed. The induced quality changes and stress responses were revealed on the levels of both transcriptome and metabolome. The results showed that soybean seeds produced under FM stress conditions had an abnormal and inferior appearance, and also contained less storage reserves, such as protein and polysaccharide. Transcriptional analysis demonstrated that genes involved in amino acid metabolism, glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid, beta-oxidation of fatty acids, and isoflavone biosynthesis were induced by FM stress. These results were supported by a multiple metabolic analysis which exhibited increases in the concentrations of a variety of amino acids, sugars, organic acids, and isoflavones, as well as reductions of several fatty acids. Reprogramming of these metabolic pathways mobilized and consumed stored protein, sugar and fatty acid reserves in the soybean seed in order to meet the energy and substrate demand on the defense system, but led to deterioration of seed quality. In general, FM stress induced catabolism of storage reserves and diminished the quality of soybean seed in the field. This study provides a more profound insight into seed deterioration caused by FM stress.

The experiment consisted of tillage practices; i. e., minimum tillage (MT), and deep tillage (DT) and variable row ratios, i.e., sole sorghum, sole millet, sole sesbania, sorghum + sesbania (1:1), sorghum + sesbania (1:2), sorghum + sesbania (2:1), millet + sesbania (1:1), millet + sesbania (1:2), millet + sesbania (2:1). The experiment was performed in RCBD with a split plot arrangement having three replications. The results indicated that forage yield was significantly affected by tillage practices; however, forage quality remained non-significant. The deep tillage produced maximum fresh forage yield (FFY) and dry matter yield (DMY) compared to MT. Cereals-sesbania row intercropping significantly affected fodder yield and quality. The maximum fresh forage and dry matter yields were observed in cereals alone and the lowest was recorded in millet + sesbania (1:2) ratios. Growing of cereals + sesbania at different row ratios improved forage quality (ash % and crude protein %); however, an increase in rows of sesbania in the mixture decreased the crude fiber contents.

The present study aimed to investigate the dynamics of biomass, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) for farming systems that produce corn intercropped with Brachiaria species. Field experiments were performed during the season and off-season, in a split-plot design. The main plots were composed of Brachiaria species (B. brizantha, B. ruziziensis and B. Convert) intercropped with corn, in addition to corn monocropping. The subplots consisted of three forage sampling periods, ranging from 0 to 60 days after the corn harvest. The intercropping arrangements did not affect the corn grain yield, nutrient accumulation and partitioning, relatively to the corn monocropping. After the grain harvest, B. brizantha achieved the greater biomass accumulation rate in both the season (69 kg ha(-1)day(-1)) and off-season (17 kg ha(-1)day(-1)). The nutrient accumulation ranged widely between the Brachiaria species and planting seasons: 0.2-1.2 kg ha(-1)day(-1) for N; 0.01-0.07 kg ha(-1)day(-1) for P; and 0.13-0.8 kg ha(-1)day(-1) for K. However, the greatest nutrient accumulation was found for B. brizantha, followed by B. ruziziensis and then B. Convert. In the short-term, corn intercropped with Brachiaria in the season showed the largest effect on the nutrient cycling and biomass yield.

However, our understandings about the influences of intercropping systems on rhizosphere microbiota composition and their association with plant performance are still limited. In this study, rhizobox microcosm experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of cropping regimes (i.e. monoculture and intercropping) on the rhizosphere bacterial microbiota and their linkages with the phytoextraction of cadmium (Cd) by Zhongyouza 19 (Brassica napus L.), Xikou Huazi (Brassica juncea L.) and Sedum alfredii using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Cadmium accumulation in shoots of B. napus and B. juncea grown under intercropping were enhanced by 370% and 27.8% respectively, as compared to monoculture. Soil compartmentation as a major determinant explained 57.6% of the rhizosphere bacterial microbiota variation, whereas plant species and cropping regime accounted for 26.4% of the variation. The overall abundance of the taxa was Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Verrucomicrobia, and Actinobacteria, Intercropping significantly enriched amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) abundance belonging to Actinobacteria, Bacilli, Deltaproteobacteria while depleting that of Acidobacteria in rhizosphere. Intercropping with S. alfredii influenced more on microbial composition of B. napus rhizosphere. The change in rhizosphere bacterial communities was related to metal availability, soil properties, and plant parameters. The enriched families of Pedosphaeraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Chitinophagaceae, Gemmatimonadaceae, Nitrosomonadaceae, and Parachlamydiaceae were positively correlated with metal concentration in plants. These results indicate that S. alfredii and oilseed rape intercropping could be a promising approach for enhancing the remediation of Cd contaminated soil. Understanding the complex plant-microbe metal interactions of intercropping system could facilitate the development of remediation strategy for phytoremediation of contaminated soils and sustainable agricultural production.

The present study investigated the effects of intercropping Vicia faba and the hyperaccumulator Sonchus asper on the Cd accumulation and root responses (morphology and secreted organic acids) of plants grown on soil from a mining area in Yunnan Province, China, under different Cd stress levels (0, 50, 100, and 200 mg kg(-1)). Intercropping increased the biomass of both S. asper and V faba, as well as the Cd accumulation and Cd transfer coefficient from roots to shoots of S. asper, but decreased those of V faba in the 200 mg kg(-1) Cd treatment. The Cd concentrations in roots, shoots, and grains from intercropped V. faba plants were positively correlated (P < 0.05) with the N,N-diethyl phenylacetamide-extractable Cd content in soil. In the 50 mg kg(-1) Cd treatment, intercropping decreased citric and malic acids in root secretions of S. asper. Intercropped V faba secreted more citric, oxalic, acetic, and malic acid compared with S. asper. Intercropping also increased root length and root surface area of both S. asper and V faba. At 50 mg kg(-1) Cd, root length for S. asper was higher than that at 0 mg kg(-1) Cd, whereas V faba roots had significantly decreased length and mean diameter. Intercropping of S. asper and V faba is suggested as an in situ phytoremediation strategy of Cd-contaminated soils and may improve the food quality of V faba.

WEED CONTROL VIA INTERCROPPING WITH GLIRICIDIA. II. CORN CROP	PLANTA DANINHA			English	Article						"Zea mays; Gliricidia sepium; cultivars; green corn; grain yield"	"MAIZE; MANAGEMENT; NITROGEN; PERFORMANCE; COMPETITION; RESPONSES; PRUNINGS; MULCHES; STRIGA; SEPIUM"	A reduction in herbicide use is one of modern agriculture's main interests and several alternatives are being investigated with this objective, including intercropping. Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) mulch has no allelopathic effect on corn or beans but significantly decreased the population of some weed species. The objective of this study was to evaluate green car and grain yield in corn cultivars as a response to weed control achieved via intercropping with gliricidia. A completely randomized block design with five replicates and split-plots was used. Cultivars AG 1051, AG 2060. BRS 2020, and PL 6880 (assigned to plots) were submitted to the following treatments: no hoeing, hoeing (performed at 20 and 40 (lays after sowing the corn), and corn intercropped with gliricidia. Gliricidia was grown in a transplanting system to ensure uniform germination and fast establishment in the field. Seeding was made in 200-cell trays with one seed per cell (35 mL volume). The plants emerged two to three days after sowing and were transplanted to a permanent site two to three (lays after emergence. Corn was sown on the same day gliricidia was transplanted. Sixteen weed species occurred at different frequencies. with uneven distribution in the experimental area. Cultivars AG 1051 and AG 2060 were the best with reference to most characteristics employed to evaluate green corn yield. Cultivars AG 1051 provided the highest grain yield. The highest green ear yield and grain yield values were obtained with hoeing. However, the fact that intercropped plots showed intermediate yield between the values obtained for hoed and non-hoed plots indicates that gliricidia was beneficial to corn, and exerted a certain level of weed control.

Endophytic PGPB Improves Plant Growth and Quality, and Modulates the Bacterial Community of an Intercropping System	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Article						"perennial ryegrass; red clover; forage; fertilization; Herbaspirillum; Azospirillum"	"BIOLOGICAL NITROGEN-FIXATION; PROMOTING BACTERIA; HERBASPIRILLUM; MAIZE; INOCULATION; STRESS; YIELD"	The intercropping of ryegrass and red clover constitutes a sustainable alternative to mitigate the adverse effects of intensive livestock production on grassland degradation by increasing forage yield and quality. The implementation of biofertilization technologies has been widely used to improve soil nutritional properties, and therefore has the potential to ensure the success of this multicrop system. To determine the impact of bioaugmentation on forage growth and quality, as well as the associate changes in the rhizosphere bacterial community, we evaluated the inoculation with two plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) under reduced nitrogen usage. Overall, Herbaspirillum sp. AP21 had a larger effect than Azospirillum brasilense D7 on plant growth. Inoculation with Herbaspirillum sp. AP21 together with 50% of the required nitrogen rate increased shoot dry weight, crude protein, and shoot nitrogen content, and decreased the amount of neutral detergent fiber. PGPB inoculation changed the rhizosphere bacterial community structure, which associated with forage growth and quality. We conclude that PGPB inoculation has the potential to improve the growth of the ryegrass-red clover system, decreasing the requirements for nitrogen fertilization.

The natural potential of salt tolerant plants like Kochia could be exploited through legume-containing intercropping systems as an effective strategy in mitigating the increasing salinity crisis.This experiment used split plots based on a randomized complete block design with three replications, in 2016 and 2017, at the Iranian National Salinity Research Center, Yazd, Iran. Water salinity was considered as the main factor (EC= 4, 9, and 14 dS m(-1)) and the cropping system was considered as subfactor with seven levels including sole cropping of Kochia (Kochia scoparia), Sesbania (Sesbania aculeate), and Guar (Cyantopsiste tragonoliba) and their possible dual and triple intercropping systems. The highest absorbed light was observed in triple intercropping and the total forage yield in triple intercropping was increased by 5% and 4.1% at 4 and 9 dS m(-1) salinity, respectively, compared to that in Kochia sole cropping, while it decreased by 1.5% at 14 dS m(-1).The Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) values ranged from 0.99 to 1.33. The total crude protein yield in triple intercropping was increased by 55.8 to 66.3% as compared to Kochia sole cropping. The NDF (Neutral Detergent Fiber) and ADF (Acid Detergent Fiber) were decreased by 7 to 22% in various intercropping systems. Considering increased forage quantity and quality, mainly through decreasing NDF and increasing Dry Matter Intake (DMI) levels, cultivation of Kochia within triple intercropping systems can be recommended instead of Kochia sole cropping.

The objectives of this study were to quantify N uptake and utilization by intercropped broad bean and garlic and determine the magnitude of N transfer from broad bean to garlic. Field and pot trials were carried out in the Erhai Lake Basin in China using N-15 tracer applied to the soil or injected into broad bean plants. Strip intercropping of garlic and broad bean increased N absorption (47.2%) compared with sole crop broad bean (31.9%) or sole crop garlic (40.7%) and reduced soil residual N. Nearly 15% of N-15 injected into petioles of broad bean intercropped with garlic was recovered in garlic at harvest, suggesting that N could be transferred from broad bean to strip intercropped garlic. The findings provide a basis for evaluating legumes' role in optimizing N fertilization when intercropped with non-legumes.

In the 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 crop seasons, two cultivation modalities were evaluated in the summer/autumn - monocropped corn with residual regrowth of signal grass (Urochloa decumbens) from the soil seed bank and corn intercropped with palisade grass (U. brizantha ' Marandu')-, in a factorial arrangement with two cutting heights for silage production -0.20 and 0.45 m. After corn silage harvest, the forages were grazed by lambs in a semi-feedlot system, in the winter/spring. Monocropped corn and 0.45-m cutting height both reduced dry matter yield for silage. Corn intercropped with palisade grass improved land use efficiency from 13 to 31% compared with monocropped crop, with land equivalent ratio greater than 1. Palisade grass showed higher light interception than signal grass over the intercrop period with corn and provided greater forage yield for lambs to graze during winter/spring.

The objective of this work was to assess the effects of corn intercropped with gliricidia and sabia (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia), a species native to the Brazilian northeastern region, on weed control and corn green ear and grain yields. The experiment was carried out at Estacao Experimental da Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Arido - UFERSA (Mossoro, State of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil). The experimental design consisted of randomized complete blocks (multifactorial design) with five replications, arranged in split-plots. The plots consisted of corn cultivars AG1051 and BM 2022; subplot treatments (six) were no-hoeing, twice-hoeing (at 20 and 40 days after sowing) and intercropping with gliricidia and sabia, either directly sown or transplanted, simultaneously with corn sowing. The intercropped leguminous plants were spaced 0.40 m from each other, and directly seeded or transplanted (30-day-old seedlings) in between two 1 m-spaced corn rows. Twenty three weed species were identified during the experiment. Gliricidia seedlings were superior to sabia seedlings with regard to plant height and survival rate. The highest corn green ear and grain yields were found for twice-hoed subplots, while the lowest yield was found for no-hoed or intercropped subplots. However, grain yield values in intercropped treatments did not differ from grain yield values in hoed plots. In addition, marketable husked green ear mean weights did not differ between twice-hoed subplots and subplots directly seeded with gliricidia and sabia. Such results indicated that corn benefited from the intercropping system, but intercropping with gliricidia and sabia transplanted resulted in lower benefits than with the direct sowing of those species."

NITROGEN DOSES AND WEED CONTROL VIA INTERCROPPING WITH GLIRICIDIA FOR CORN PRODUCTION	PLANTA DANINHA			English	Article						"Zea mays; Gliricidia sepium; ammonium sulfate; green corn; grain yield"	"MAIZE HYBRIDS; CROP; COMPETITION; NIGERIA; INTERFERENCE; POPULATION; MANAGEMENT; GENOTYPES; TILLAGE; GREEN"	Many studies have demonstrated the beneficial influence of nitrogen doses on corn dry grain yield and green ear yield. Due to a growing concern with environmental degradation, many agricultural practices, adopted in the past, are being reexamined. With regard to weed control, strategies that employ mechanical control, including intercrops, are being the object of renewed interest. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the application of nitrogen doses (0, 40, 80, and 120 kg N ha(-1), as ammonium sulfate) and weed control on the growth, green ear yield, and grain yield of the AG 1051 corn cultivar. A randomized block experimental design with split-plots and nine replications was adopted. In addition to nitrogen rates, the AG 1051 cultivar was submitted to the following treatments, applied to subplots: no weeding, two hoeings (at 20 and 40 days after sowing), and intercropping with gliric dia (Gliricidia sepium). Gliricidia was sowed at corn planting, between the corn rows, using two seedlings per pit, in pits spaced 0.30 m apart. Gliricidia did not provide weed control, and gave plant growth, green ear yield and grain yield values similar to the no weeding treatment. However, regarding the number of mature ears got, intercropping with gliricidia did not differ from the two-hoeing treatment. Weed control did not have an effect on plant height and number of marketable, husked green ears, with the application of 120 kg N ha(-1), indicating that nitrogen improved the corn's competitive ability. The two-hoeing treatment provided the best means for total green ears weight, number of marketable husked ears, both unhusked and husked marketable ear weight, grain yield and its components than the other treatments. Nitrogen application increased corn growth, green ear yield, and grain yield, as well as weed green biomass, but reduced the stand and growth of gliricidia.	[Silva, P. S.

A randomized block design with ten replicates was used. The cultivar was submitted to the following treatments: A = hoeings at 20 and 40 days after corn sowing (DACS), B = hoeing at 20 DACS + gliricidia sowing after hoeing, C = gliricidia sowing together with corn sowing + hoeing at 40 DACS, D = gliricidia sowing together with corn sowing, and E = no hoeing. Gliricidia was sown at a density of 30 viable seeds m(-2). After harvesting the mature ears, the area of each plot was divided into eight sampling units measuring 1.2 m(2) each to evaluate weed growth (above-ground dry biomass). Treatment A provided the highest baby corn, green corn, and grain yields. Treatment B did not differ from treatment A with respect to the yield values for the three products, and was equivalent to treatment C for green corn yield, but was superior to C with regard to baby corn weight and grain yield. Treatments D and E provided similar yields and were inferior to the other treatments. Therefore, treatment B is a promising one. The relation between coefficient of experimental variation (CV) and sample size (S) to evaluate growth of the above-ground part of the weeds was given by the equation CV = 37.57 S-0.15, i. e., CV decreased as S increased. The optimal sample size indicated by this equation was 4.3 m(2).	"[Tavella, L. B.; Silva, P. S. L.; Oliveira, V. R.; Fernandes, P. L. O.; Sousa, R.

Studies on the survival of pathogenic microorganisms in the soil after use of wastewater for fertilization of agricultural crops report the effects of moisture, pH, organic matter, and soil temperature on microorganisms. There are few studies that assess the survival of these microorganisms in the rhizosphere of plants fertilized with wastewater. Thus, the aim of this study was to quantify the number of fecal coliforms and rhizobacteria (fluorescent Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus spp,) in the rhizosphere of winter and summer crops fertilized with wastewater. In the experiment, we used 20 plots, and each plot occupied an area of 200 m(2). The treatments used in the winter crop consisted of uncultivated plots and single crops of wheat, triticale, black bean, and intercropped black bean/wheat. In the summer season, we used uncultivated plots and single crops of corn, sunflower, bean, and intercropped bean/corn. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with five treatments and four replications. Soil samples from the rhizosphere for microbiological analyses were collected at the flowering stage of the crops at a depth of 0.00-0.20 m. Plants stimulated fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. and Bacillus spp. in the rhizosphere, with average scores of 7.9 and 6.9 log CFU g(-1) of dry soil, respectively, whereas in bare soil, these scores were 6.7 and 5.8 log CFU g(-1) of dry soil for these rhizobacteria groups. However, this stimulating effect was not seen for fecal coliforms, which had an average score of 31.7 x 103 MPN g(-1) of dry soil in the uncultivated area and 20.0 x 10(3) MPN g(-1) of dry soil in crop areas. Overall, the numbers of rhizobacteria colonies in the rhizosphere soil under intercropping were higher than those observed in the rhizosphere soils of single winter and summer crops. Therefore, the presence of plants enhances the development of rhizobacteria and changes the balance among the species of microorganisms in the soil microbial community fertilized with wastewater.

Plants under low light can carry significant weight in physiological parameters that can limit growth. Light is one of the abiotic factors that limits productivity; in the present study, it was hypothesized that tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) intercropping in different transplanting periods promotes changes in gas exchange, photosynthetic pigments, and biomass accumulation in two lettuce cultivars. An experimental study was carried out in Jaboticabal, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The treatments consisted of a combination of the following factors: lettuce (one 'Lucy Brown' plant between two tomato plants and two 'Vanda' plants between tomato plants), two cultivation systems (intercropping and monoculture), and four lettuce transplanting periods (0, 7, 14. and 21 d after tomato transplanting). The experiment was a randomized block with a 3 x 2 x 4 factorial design and four replicates. Transpiration and stomatal conductance were reduced in lettuce by insterspersing plants under a monoculture system. Lettuce-tomato intercropping severely reduced photosynthesis, fluorescence, chlorophyll pigment content, and DM accumulation.

The following were evaluated: indirect readings of leaf-chlorophyll content (Falker chlorophyll index, ICF), macronutrient content in leaves, yield components and grain yield of corn, and forage dry mass yield after intercropping. It was observed that the species U. ruziziensis was more competitive with corn in intercropping, providing lower nutritional content and ICF in both evaluated seasons. Vegetative growth, yield components, and grain yield of corn were not affected by the intercrops. Nitrogen topdressing fertilization linearly increases the ICF, leaf contents of N, P and S, as well as the yield components and grain yield.

The class III homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip III) gene family is central to the regulation of vascular development. In this research, we performed an overall analysis of the HD-Zip III genes in soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.). Our analysis included the phylogeny, conservation domains and cis-elements in the promoters of these genes. We used the quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to characterize the expression patterns of HD-Zip III genes in leaf vein development and analyze the effects of exogenous hormone treatments. In this study, twelve HD-Zip III genes were identified from the soybean genome and named. All soybean HDZip III proteins contained four highly conserved domains. GmHB15-L-1 transcripts showed steadily increasing accumulation during all stages of leaf vein development and were highly expressed in cambium cells. GmREV-L-1 and GmHB14-L-2 had nearly identical expression patterns in soybean leaf vein tissues. GmREV-L-1 and GmHB14-L-2 transcripts remained at stable high levels at all xylem developmental stages. GmREV-L-1 and GmHB14-L-2 were expressed at high levels in the vascular cambium and xylem cells. Overall, GmHB15-L-1 may be an essential regulator that is responsible for the formation or maintenance of soybean vein cambial cells. GmREV-L-1 and GmHB14-L-2 were correlated with xylem differentiation in soybean leaf veins. This study will pave the way for identifying the molecular mechanism of leaf vein development.

Starch is used in many foods and nonfood industrial applications and as a renewable energy resource. Sorghum starches with different amylose contents affect the different physicochemical properties. In this study, we isolated starches from six sorghum varieties (i.e., Jinza 34, Liaoza 19, Jinnuo 3, Jiza 127, Jiniang 2, and Jiaxian) and investigated them in terms of their chemical compositions and physicochemical properties. All the starch granules had regular polygonal round shapes and showed the characteristic Maltese cross. These six sorghum starches showed an A-type diffraction pattern. The highest amylose content of starch in Jinza 127 was 26.90%. Jiaxian had a higher water solubility at 30, 70, and 90 degrees C. From the flow cytometry analysis based on six sorghum starch granules, Liaoza 19 had a larger and more complex granules (particle percentage (P1) = 66.5%). The Jinza 34 starch had higher peak (4994.00 mPa.s) and breakdown viscosity (4013.50 mPa.s) and lower trough viscosity (973.50 mPa.s). Jinnuo 3 had higher onset temperature, peak temperature, conclusion temperature, gelatinization enthalpy, and gelatinization range. The principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis based on classification of different sorghum starches showed that Jiniang 2 and Jinnuo 3 had similar physicochemical properties and most divergent starches, respectively. Our result provides useful information not only on the use of sorghum starches in food and non-food industries but for the great potential of sorghum-based intercropping systems in maintaining agricultural sustainability.

However, little is known about how organically managed hybridised perennial wheat (Triticum aestivum L. x Thinopyrum spp.) stimulates SOC, microbial biomass and activity in marginal soils. Therefore, the effect of three organically managed cropping systems: i) sole perennial wheat; ii) perennial wheat with clover intercrop; and iii) annual wheat; were investigated at three sites in Germany on marginal soils with different textures (silt loam (SL) with impervious soil layer, clay loam (CL) with 30-35% stone content and sandy soil (SS) with low nutrient content). Soil samples, from each cropping system and site, were taken from A- and B-horizons after 3 years of cultivation and were evaluated for SOC, microbial biomass C and N (MBC, MBN), basal respiration, and C-enzyme activities. In CL and SS soils, perennial wheat with clover intercrop increased SOC in the A-horizon compared with annual wheat and sole perennial wheat. Varied effects were observed in the B-horizon, with sole perennial wheat in CL having higher SOC and MBC than the other two cropping systems. SOC storage stock in the B-horizon of perennial wheat was on average 18% higher relative to annual wheat, revealing a considerable C storage potential. Overall, the study showed that perennial wheat cultivation can improve microbial biomass and activity in marginal soils compared with cultivation of annual wheat."

MILLSP.	Pigeon pea is an underutilized crop in Nigeria and particularly in Oyo State in terms of research, production and utilization despite its economic and nutrition importance. It is therefore important to understand its current production status in Oyo State in order to evaluate the economic potential of pigeon pea production in the study area. This study therefore, profiled the current production systems of pigeon pea, analyzed the current and forecast the future farm size and examined the constraints to pigeon pea production in Oyo State. Multistage sampling procedure was used to select 150 pigeon pea farmers. A structured questionnaire was used to gather primary data from the respondents. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Markov Chain Analysis (MCA) and Importance Ranking Index. The study found that all the farmers still cultivated local variety with average yield of 604kg/acre, most farmers intercropped with other crops and produced mainly for consumption by households and sale at the local market. Majority (73%) cultivated between 1 and 5 acres of land and on the average, 1.55 and 1.72 acres of land were cultivated in 2017/2018 and 2018/2019, respectively. There was significant difference between the land area cultivated to pigeon pea in 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 (1.63, p < 0.05). The results of MCA revealed that there was high probability for the farmers to remain on their farm size initially cultivated. Although, gradual increase in the farm size was observed in the equilibrium year. The persuasive identified constraints included inadequate capital, pricing problem and lack of improved variety. The study concluded that the outlook of pigeon pea production seems promising as revealed by the farm size cultivated at the equilibrium year, but a deliberate effort must be made to promote the production of and research on pigeon pea in the study area, especially in the development of improved varieties.

The objectives of this research were to evaluate forage productivity and nutritive value, along with stand establishment of alfalfa in a corn grain system in Iowa, Minnesota, and North Dakota. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with four replicates at each site. Treatments included were: sole corn (i.e., check; T1), sole alfalfa (T2), alfalfa intercropped into corn (T3), a prohexadione-treated alfalfa intercropped with corn (T4), and a spring-seeded alfalfa in the year after intercropping (T5), which was planted in plots with T1 the previous year. All sites had below normal rainfall in 2016 and 2017. Corn grain yield was significantly lower when intercropped with alfalfa (T3 and T4) compared with the check corn crop (no alfalfa, T1). Corn grain yield reduction ranged from 14.0% to 18.8% compared with the check (T1). Corn biomass yield was reduced by intercropped alfalfa (T3 and T4) by 15.9% to 25.8%. In the seeding year, alfalfa seasonal forage yield was significantly greater when corn competition was absent in all environments. The intercropped alfalfa from the previous season (T3 and T4) had almost double the forage yield than the alfalfa in the seeding year (spring-seeded alfalfa; T5). In the second production year, there were no meaningful forage yield differences (p > 0.05) across all treatments, indicating alfalfa in intercropping systems does not affect forage yield past the first production year. Prohexadione-calcium, a growth regulator, did not affect alfalfa stand density, forage yield and nutritive value. The forage nutritive value was dependent on harvest date not the alfalfa intercropping treatments. Results of our study suggest that establishing alfalfa with corn is feasible and can be a potential alternative for the upper Midwest region. However, when under drought conditions, this system might be less resilient since competition between alfalfa and corn for soil moisture will be intensified under drought or moisturelimited conditions, and this will likely depress corn grain yield. Research targeted to reintroduce perennial crops into the current dominant corn-soybean systems in the US Corn Belt is urgently needed to improve stability and resiliency of production systems."

Microbial life history strategies determine their responses to soil resource availability, thereby affecting soil nutrient cycling. However, our knowledge about microbial strategies under different management practices is limited. The objective of this study was to explore how microbial functional traits and life history strategies respond to different cropping patterns. We analyzed bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities as well as their functional traits under different cropping patterns in representative soybean (Glycine max) planting regions across China using high-throughput sequencing and quantitative PCR data. Results showed that intercropping increased soil carbon and nitrogen pools, while rotation reduced soil carbon pool. By analyzing the shared species between keystones and indicators (keystone indicators), the selection of microbial communities by cropping patterns was observed at both taxonomic and functional levels. Intercropping harbored more bacterial and fewer fungal keystone indicators than rotation, which were characterized by special substrate preference in the two systems. Moreover, soil properties oppositely influenced bacterial and archaeal core functional traits, but did not limit fungal core functional traits. The ecological associations between soil properties and microbial functional traits illustrated that bacterial and archaeal life history strategies were affiliated to resource acquisition, while fungi adopted high yield strategy. Taken together, the results indicated that different soybean cropping patterns impacted trait-based microbial life history strategies by changing soil nutrients.

Instead of relying on chemical weed control, there is a dire need to explore alternative eco-friendly agricultural practices for weed suppression and sustainable wheat production. Mulching being eco-friendly could potentially serve the purpose towards weed suppression organically. To check the usefulness of mulching, two-year studies were conducted under field conditions in Haripur, Pakistan, during 2014 and 2015 to elucidate the response of various mulching materials for weed control in wheat. Six mulch material treatments were used along with Buctril super (used as check) at the rate of 1.235 L ha(-1) to control the most problematic weed species of wheat in Pakistan. Experiments were designed under randomized complete block design with four repeats. The analysis of data revealed a significant decrease in weed density, relative weed density, fresh and dry plant biomass at 25, 50 and 75 days after sowing (DAS) where Buctril super at 1.235 L ha(-1) and mulch of black plastic were used followed by sugarcane bagasse and dry leaves of mulberry, as compared with control (untreated). Higher density of weed, relative weed density, fresh and dry plant biomass were observed in test weed species of wheat where lentil was applied with wheat and dry leaves of mulberry were incorporated. Net economic benefits in the form of benefit cost ratio (2.55) were higher where grass clippings were applied followed by sugarcane bagasse (2.43), mulberry leaves (2.49), while the lowest net economic benefits (1.72) were obtained when lentil (grown as live mulch crop) with wheat was intercropped. It was concluded from the study that sugarcane bagasse and grass clippings could be a source to control weeds in the wheat with a minimum cost of production at Haripur, Pakistan, and similar agro-climatic environment.

Twenty-seven uniformity trials were carried out with pearl millet, slender leaf rattlebox, and showy rattlebox cultivated alone and intercropped. Fresh matter productivity was evaluated in 972 basic experimental units (BEU) of 1 m x 1 m (36 BEU per trial). The optimum plot size was determined using the methods modified maximum curvature, linear response with plateau model, and quadratic response with plateau model. The optimum plot size differs between methods and decreases in the following order: quadratic response with plateau model (9.94 m(2)), linear response with plateau model (7.41 m(2)), and modified maximum curvature (3.49 m(2)). The optimum plot size to evaluate the fresh matter productivity of pearl millet, slender leaf rattlebox, and showy rattlebox cultivated alone or intercropped is 7.41 m(2). This size could be used as a reference for future experiments.

Allelopathic potential and allelochemicals in different intercrops for weed management in rainfed cotton	CURRENT SCIENCE			English	Article						"Allelochemicals; allelopathic potential; intercrops; rainfed cotton; relative neighbour effect"	"PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; PLANT DEFENSE; LIVING MULCH; PHYTOTOXICITY; SUPPRESSION; GERMINATION; MECHANISMS"	Allelochemicals released by plants serve as the primary defence by targeting the establishment of weeds and other plants. In this study, 12 different intercrops were assessed over five seasons for total phenol and terpenoid content. A detailed analysis on allelochemicals produced was also done using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to correlate with their weed suppression efficiency. Total phenol content of intercrops ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 mg g(-1) tissue dry wt, with the highest value in carom followed by sorghum, sunnhemp and marigold. Total terpenoid content of leaf extracts of the intercrops varied from 14.5 to 35.9 mu g g(-1) tissue dry wt, wherein pearl millet had maximum terpenoid content (35.9 mu g g(-1) tissue dry wt) followed by sunnhemp and sesame. Analysis using GC-MS indicated the presence of some unique as well as common allelochemicals in the experimental intercrops. To correlate the abundance of these allelochemicals released from intercrops with their weed suppression competence, relative neighbour effect (RNE) value was determined for each intercrop. Positive RNE values for sunnhemp, pearl millet and sesame indicate their efficiency in effectively reducing weed population than the other intercrops. Thus, intercrops with high phenolic, terpenoid and other allelochemicals specific to sunnhemp, pearl millet and sesame can be correlated well with weed suppression as perceptible from their RNE values.

Included in the study were sorgho-Sudan grass (good R. similis host), sweet potato and common bean (intermediate hosts), soybean and sunn hemp (poor hosts), and marigold (non-host). Significant plant growth-promoting effect of single AMF and rhizobial colonisation in the good and intermediate R. similis hosts sorgho-Sudangrass (AMF) and common bean (AMF and rhizobium), respectively, was observed whereas this plant growth-promoting effect was absent in the other intercrops with the exception of sunn hemp with significant plant growth-promoting effect of AMF colonisation on fresh root weight. An additive plant growth-promoting effect of dual AMF and rhizobial colonisation (on fresh shoot weight) was only observed in the poor R. similis host soybean. Single AMF and rhizobial colonisation also resulted in a significant bio-protective effect against R. similis in sorgho-Sudangrass (AMF), sweet potato cv. Inzovu (AMF) and common bean (AMF and rhizobium). The growth-promoting and bio-protective effects of AMF colonisation were clearly present in the good and intermediate R. similis hosts with moderate to high relative mycorrhizal dependency (RMD) values ranging from 47% (sorgho-Sudangrass) to 65% (common bean) but absent in the intermediate R. similis host sweet potato, which had a negative RMD value, and in the poor and non- R. similis hosts. Overall, no suppressive effect of R. similis infection on AMF and rhizobial colonisation was observed except in soybean and sunn hemp in which AMF colonisation was significantly reduced.

However, the responses of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms in the continuous-cropping soil to different intercropping systems in different growing seasons are still insufficiently studied. Here, we investigated the effects of seven intercropping systems (alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)/cucumber, trifolium (Trifolium repens L.)/cucumber, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/cucumber, rye (Secale cereale L.)/cucumber, chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum coronrium L.)/cucumber, rape (Brassica campestris L.)/cucumber, mustard (Brassica juncea L.)/cucumber) on soil physical and chemical properties, potential nitrification rate (PNR), soil ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) communities in the greenhouse in spring and autumn. The results showed that, compared with cucumber monoculture, intercropping increased the soil NH+4-N and NO3--N. The chrysanthemum-cucumber, rape-cucumber, and mustard-cucumber treatments increased soil PNR. Intercropping increased the AOA and AOB abundances in two seasons, especially in rape-cucumber, wheat-cucumber, chrysanthemum-cucumber, and trifolium-cucumber treatments. The ratio of AOA and AOB decreased with seasonal variation. The wheat-cucumber and rape-cucumber treatments increased soil AOA community diversity. Seasonal variation had a significant effect on the relative abundance of the AOB community. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis showed that the AOA and AOB community structures were obviously different from spring to autumn. Redundancy analysis showed that the AOA community was significantly regulated by moisture, NO3--N, and available potassium (AK), while the AOB community was significantly regulated by moisture, available phosphorus (AP), AK, NO3--N, and pH. Network analysis showed that the co-occurrence relationship and complexity of AOA and AOB communities were different in two growing seasons. The AOB community may play a critical role in ammonia oxidation in autumn. Taken together, intercropping improved soil physicochemical state, increased soil PNR and significantly altered soil AOA and AOB communities. Seasonal variation significantly altered the AOA and AOB communities' structure and interaction between them. The effect of seasonal variation on AOA and AOB communities was greater than intercropping.

Soil water dynamics under a warm-season cover crop mixture in continuous wheat	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH			English	Article						"Cover crops; Soil water; Infiltration; Wheat"		Cover crop technology can potentially benefit monoculture wheat systems in the semi-arid US Southern Great Plains, but the biggest hurdle in such regions where evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation is soil water. Cover crop impact on soil water use and availability is a major cause for concern in water-limited environments. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of cover crops, grazing, and intercrops on soil water dynamics under rainfed conditions. Seven treatments were evaluated, including conventional tillage (CT) and combinations of no-tillage (NT) with a cover crop mixture, grazed cover crops, and/or cash crop intercropping. The three-year study was conducted on a long-term NT continuous wheat system in the Texas Rolling Plains. Despite dry periods, the cover crop mixture produced 2141 to 3503 kg ha(-1) dry herbage mass. Stored soil water was significantly lower within 60 days after planting for cover crop compared to no cover crop treatments. Stored soil water was 22-26% lower in cover crop plots at time of termination. In the final two years of the study, the positive change in stored soil water from cover crop termination to wheat planting was two to four times greater for cover crop treatments compared to non-cover crop treatments. The greater infiltration and water capture after termination has the potential to make up for the loss in soil water that cover crops used.

The systems consisted of sugarcane + mustard-ratoon-cowpea (SmRC), sugarcane + potato-ratoon-wheat (SpRW) and a standard sugarcane-ratoon-wheat (SRW) rotation. The SpRW system recorded a significantly higher cane equivalent yield (120.4 t ha(-1)) than SmRC (109.4 t ha(-1)) and SRW (92.6 t ha(-1)), which was 10.1% and 30.0% greater, respectively. However, the highest microbial activities (microbial counts, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen and basal soil respiration), soil enzymes, total carbon (TC) and nitrogen (TN), available N, Zn, Cu, Fe and cation exchange capacity (CEC) were recorded for SmRC system. The available K and S content were greater in SRW, while the highest average substrate oxidation rate was recorded in SmRC (0.00291 OD h(-1)), which was 14.1% and 7.58% more than that of SpRW and SRW systems, respectively. Moreover, SmRC significantly increased functional diversity indices and soil quality index. Total N, soil organic carbon, available P and S were identified as the key soil quality indicators, contributing 31.8, 30.9, 12.9 and 10.8% toward quality development, respectively. The highest functional diversity indices of microbial community, soil quality and crop productivity under intercropping are the result of greater SOC, TC, TN, microbial and enzymatic activities. In conclusion, intercropping of mustard or potato in sugarcane could be the way to increase crop productivity in limited land resources in subtropical areas of India.	"[Singh, S.

The experiment was performed in randomized complete blocks, in a 4x2 factorial arrangement (four genotypes x two cropping systems). The genotypes intercropped or not with butterfly pea were: IRI-381 and Elephant B, tall sized; and Taiwan A-146 2.37 and Mott, dwarf. Forage was harvested 60 days after regrowth. In the silage from Mott grass intercropped with butterfly pea, lower contents of lignin (78.1 g kg(-1)), neutral detergent fiber (636.0 g kg(-1)), and neutral detergent insoluble protein (13.15 g kg(-1)), besides a greater dry matter recovery (873.3 g kg(-1)), were observed.

However, greater residual water-soluble carbohydrate contents were observed in the silages from the intercrop (1.85 mg g(-1)) and from the Mott grass monocrop (1.51 mg g(-1)). Moreover, there was a lower in vitro dry matter digestibility (676.7 g kg(-1)) for the silage from the intercrop. Dwarf genotypes increase the nutritional value of elephant grass silage, compared with the tall-sized ones. Intercropping with butterfly pea improves silage fermentation characteristics, despite reducing its digestibility. Therefore, the ensilage of dwarf Mott elephant grass intercropped with butterfly pea shows more promising results."

To improve utilization of common vetch-oat mixtures as feed in Serbia, the objective of this investigation was to evaluate the crude protein (CP) and carbohydrate (CHO) fractions in these feeds using the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS) depending on the stage of plant development and seeding rate of common vetch and oat in the mixtures. The experiment was conducted at the experimental field of Institute for forage crops, Krusevac - Serbia, in 2015. The field trial was arranged in a randomized block design with three replications. In this research, pure stands of common vetch and oat, and their seed mixtures (common vetch:oat - 1:1.5; 1:1 and 1:0.5) were studied harvested at three different cutting stages: beginning of vetch flowering - 10% of flowering; forming the first pods on 2/3 vetch plants and forming green seeds in 2/3 pods. The samples were analyzed for protein and carbohydrate fractions according to CNCPS. Stage of growth affected significantly all carbohydrate and protein fractions, except unavailable PC fraction of crude protein which did not change with plant growth and development. The highest protein fraction was intermediately degraded PB2 fraction of crude protein. The highest carbohydrate fraction was available cell wall - CB3 fraction of carbohydrate. According to the results obtained in these investigations, it was concluded that common vetch-oat mixtures varied significantly with respect to their carbohydrate and protein fraction. Due to lower CC fraction, oat was superior feed in terms of total carbohydrates supply to ruminants. Among all investigated mixtures and pure stand of oat and common vetch, it could be conclude that mixture with 1:1 common vetch-oat rate was superior because of higher CA and CB3 fractions of total carbohydrate and the highest PB2 fraction of crude protein."

However, CA has not been adopted by local smallholder farmers, probably because the three-component package constitutes a large burden for the farmers. Our previous study revealed that two components - minimum tillage and crop residue mulching - are sufficient for soil conservation and intercropping, when used in combination with minimum tillage and crop residue mulching, had no effect on erosion control. In the present study, we conducted a 3-year field experiment in Burkina Faso to evaluate the effects of the intercropping component on sorghum yield. The four treatments employed were conventional practice (full tillage, no sorghum residue mulching, no intercropping), two-component CA (minimum tillage and sorghum residue mulching without intercropping), and three-component CA with velvet bean (VB) or pigeon pea (PP) intercropping. We found that sorghum yield was similar between treatments during the first 2 years but higher for CA with PP intercropping than for conventional practice in the third year. This increased yield was mainly attributed to higher soil nitrogen and carbon content as well as panicle mass and harvest index observed for CA with PP intercropping than for conventional practice. Unexpectedly, however, PP produced few seeds and did not survive the dry season. Therefore, we concluded that CA with PP intercropping is effective to increase sorghum yield but practical only for the prosperous farmers who can afford to purchase PP seeds every year and accept no increased yield during the first 2 years after its installation. For most smallholder farmers, it would be realistic to promote two-component CA without intercropping because it can effectively control water erosion and reduce the farmers' burden of its adoption in the Sudan Savanna.

A meta-analysis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"Intercropping; Grain legumes; Symbiotic N(2)fixation; Soil N acquisition; Ecosystem services; Plant interactions"	"SYMBIOTIC N-2 FIXATION; PEA-BARLEY INTERCROPS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CROPPING SYSTEMS; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; YIELD STABILITY; INORGANIC N; BIODIVERSITY; PRODUCTIVITY; AGRICULTURE"	Grain legumes are known for their benefits to deliver ecosystem services on provisioning of protein-rich food and feed, reducing greenhouse gas emissions through the symbiotic nitrogen fixation function and diversification of cropping systems. Intercropping is an agroecological practice in which two or more crop species are grown simultaneously in the same field, thereby maximizing the use of resources to enhance yields in low input systems and the resilience of cropping systems. We quantified the effect of grain legume-cereal intercropping on the use of N resources in temperate agroecosystems, focusing on dinitrogen (N-2) fixation and soil-derived nitrogen acquisition using a meta-analysis of 29 field-scale studies. We estimated and compared effects of different intercrop compositions (proportion of each species in the intercrops), fertilization rates, crop species, soil properties, and other management practices on the symbiotic N-2 fixation and the acquisition of soil-derived nitrogen by the cereals and grain legumes. The proportion of N derived from N-2 fixation was on average 14 % (95 % CI = [11, 16]) higher in intercropped grain legumes (76 %) compared to legume sole crops (66 %). On the other hand, intercropping reduced the amount of N-2 fixed (kg ha(-1)) by about 15 %, when N(2 )fixation in inter- and sole cropped legumes was expressed at equivalent density by compensating for the sown legume proportion in intercrops relative to their sole crop sowing rate. The results were mainly influenced by the intercrop composition, legumes species and the method used to quantify N-2 fixation. Soil-derived nitrogen acquisition in intercropped grain legumes was significantly reduced (- 47 %, 95 % CI = [- 56, - 36]) compared to sole crop legumes, expressed at equivalent density, while the soil N acquired by intercropped cereals was much higher (+ 61 %, 95% CI = [24, 108]) than in sole crop cereals. Total soil N acquisition (legume + cereal) was significantly higher in intercrops than in legume sole crops (+ 25 %, 95 % CI = [1, 54]), while there was no significant difference between intercrops and cereal sole crops. The meta-analysis confirms and highlights that intercropping consistently stimulates complementary N use between legumes and cereals by increasing N-2 fixation by grain legumes and increasing soil N acquisition in cereals. Based on the results of this analysis it would be suggested that cropping systems diversification via intercropping can be used for simultaneous production of both cereals and grain legumes, while increasing the use of N-sources and reducing external inputs of N fertilizers, thereby enhancing the sustainability of agriculture.

A field experiment investigated the effects of the cropping system on crop productivity and the capture and use efficiency of heat and light in two fields differing in soil fertility. Three planting patterns, namely cotton intercropped with wheat (CIW), cotton directly seeded after wheat (CDW), and cotton transplanted after wheat (CTW), as well as one cotton monoculture (CM) system were used. Cotton-wheat double cropping significantly increased crop productivity and land equivalent ratios relative to the CM system in both fields. As a result of increased growing degree days (GDD), intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (IPAR), and photothermal product (PTP), the capture of light and heat in the double-cropping systems was compared with that in the CM system in both fields. With improved resource capture, the double-cropping systems exhibited a higher light and heat use efficiency according to thermal product efficiency, solar energy use efficiency (E-u), radiation use efficiency (RUE), and PTP use efficiency (PTPU). The cotton lint yield and biomass were not significantly correlated with RUE across cropping patterns, indicating that RUE does not limit cotton production. Among the double-cropping treatments, CDW had the lowest GDD, IPAR, and PTP values but the highest heat and light resource use efficiency and highest overall resource use efficiency. This good performance was even more obvious in the high-fertility field. Therefore, we encourage the expanded use of CDW in the Yellow River Valley, especially in fields with high fertility, given the high productivity and resource use efficiency of this system. Moreover, the use of agronomic practices involving a reasonably close planting density, optimized irrigation and nutrient supply, and the application of new short-season varieties of cotton or wheat can potentially enhance CDW crop yields and productivity.

In order to synchronize this tradeoff, a field trial integrating potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) with lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus L.) and dolichos (Lablab purpureus L.) in intercropping system was conducted in the upper midland [1552 m above sea level (masl), lower highland (1894 masl) and upper highland (2552 masl)] agro-ecological zones of Kenya. Nitrogen gains from mineralization, fertilization, biological fixation, and outputs from biomass accumulation, leaching, volatilization and soil erosion were quantified using standard procedures. Soil N balance ranged from - 10.7 to - 18.1 kg N ha(-1) for sole potato, 4.1 to 6.6 kg N ha(-1) for intercropping and 2.9 to 22.3 kg N ha(-1) for sole legumes. The intermediate range of polyphenol and lignin contents in intercropping enhanced N mineralization with peak N release of 8 to 9 kg N ha(-1) matching with peak N uptake by potato (19.9 to 31.2 kg N ha(-1)). Nitrate was leached below the active root zone in sole potato cropping (4.2 to 46.6 kg N ha(-1)), a process that was diverged by the deep root systems of legume intercrops. These results suggest that legume intercropping can provide a means of balancing the nitrogen retained in the biomass and soil, thus offering a mechanism for optimizing the soil N balance in smallholder potato farming systems.

However, relationship and mechanisms of the interactive effects of these two stress factors on crops are elusive. Here, we report our identification of relationship between shade and drought and their interactive effects on soybean plants. Our quantitative-real time PCR (q-PCR) results showed that shade significantly up-regulated Abscisic Acid (ABA) biosynthesis (NCED3 and AAO3) and signaling (ABI4 and ABI5) genes. Moreover, shade massively enhanced the ABA contents. Based on these results, we subjected soybean seedlings to pretreatment of shade (Pre-SH) and normal light (Pre-NL) followed by polyethylene glycol 6000 induced drought stress. Drought resulted in the reduction of relative water content, morphophysiological and biochemical parameters under both light regimes. However, plants grown under Pre-SH treatment protected their cells from damaging effects of drought by scavenging more reactive oxygen species (ROS) through enhancement of its defense system as compared to Pre-NL plants. Hence, our findings demonstrated that plants grown under Pre-NL conditions were more affected with drought stress than those of Pre-SH ones which suggested that pretreatment of shade can enhance the drought resistance of soybean seedlings.

However, intercropping leads to shading of wheat and the grain yield might be decreased due to reduced photosynthetic rate and leaf area index. This study was conducted to investigate the changes on transcriptional profile of wheat leaves in response to different levels of shading. Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. 'Xindong 20) was planted under three shading levels, namely, no-shading (control), 25% shading, and 75% shading. The dry weight of wheat plants was determined at flowering and maturity periods. The photosynthetic rate of flag leaves was determined at flowering and filling stages. Flag leaves from each group were collected at the heading stage for RNA sequencing. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to validate the results of RNA sequencing. Wheat plants had longer growth period, decreased dry weight and photosynthetic rate of flag leaves under different levels of shading. A total of 12,597 and 28,349 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in 25% shading group and 75% shading group, respectively. Functional enrichment analyses suggested that upregulated genes in 25% shading group were mainly involved in regulating cell homeostasis, especially in redox homeostasis. The upregulated genes in the 75% shading group were involved in nitrogen compound metabolic process. In addition, the downregulated genes of the two groups were both enriched in phosphorus metabolic processes. A total of 2,015 unigenes were identified as transcription factors. Ten of 16 DEGs (At3g21620, ETR1, 1-SST, PSB28, HEMH, Os10g0493600, 6-FEH, CIN2, PORA, and CPX) involved in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, photosynthesis, and galactose metabolism were successfully validated by qRT-PCR. In conclusion, these data, revealed transcriptional dynamics of wheat under different shading levels, will provide essential clues for deciphering the gene regulatory networks mediating the wheat response to shading, especially at heading stage. 2020 Friends Science Publishers	"[Li, Xiaorong; Li, Jianfeng; Zhang, Hongzhi; Wang, Lihong; Wang, Zhong; Zhang, Yueqiang; Fan, Zheru; Shi, Jia; Zhao, Qi] Xinjiang Acad Agr Sci, Inst Nucl & Biol Technol, Urumqi 830091, Peoples R China; [Li, Jianfeng; Zhang, Hongzhi; Wang, Lihong; Wang, Zhong; Zhang, Yueqiang; Fan, Zheru; Shi, Jia; Zhao, Qi] Minist Agr, Key Lab Crop Ecophysiol & Farming Syst Desert Oas, Urumqi 830091, Peoples R China"		"Zhao, Q (corresponding author), Xinjiang Acad Agr Sci, Inst Nucl & Biol Technol, Urumqi 830091, Peoples R China.;Zhao, Q (corresponding author), Minist Agr, Key Lab Crop Ecophysiol & Farming Syst Desert Oas, Urumqi 830091, Peoples R China."	zhq0817@sina.com			"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0300110]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31560370]"	"National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))"	This work was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2016YFD0300110) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31560370).		52	0	0	12	37	FRIENDS SCIENCE PUBL	FAISALABAD	399-B, PEOPLES COLONY NO 1, FAISALABAD, 38090, PAKISTAN	1560-8530	1814-9596		INT J AGRIC BIOL	Int.

Effect of simultaneous shade and drought stress on morphology, leaf gas exchange, and yield parameters of different soybean cultivars	PHOTOSYNTHETICA			English	Article						"drought; intercropping; morphology; photosynthesis; shade; stress"	"CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; RUBISCO ACTIVITY; PHOTOSYNTHETIC CAPACITY; WATER RELATIONS; IONIC TITANIUM; USE EFFICIENCY; STEM STRENGTH; SEED YIELD; LEAVES; LIGHT"	An interactive effect of simultaneous shade and drought stress on drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive cultivars of soybean was studied. As drought stress intensified, the net photosynthetic rate decreased in both cultivars due to reduced leaf area, relative water content, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, chlorophyll content, and Rubisco activity which ultimately led to yield reduction. Moreover, the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters also decreased. Interestingly, a moderate shade was found helpful in alleviating the adverse effects of drought stress, specifically in resistant cultivar N12 where seed yield improved significantly under moderate drought conditions in contrast to the cultivar C103. In summary, the effect of drought stress on soybean depended on the irradiance conditions and shade could enhance soybean drought resistance, although this resistance was cultivar dependent. With appropriate cultivar selection, a moderate shade can help optimize yield and improve the performance of drought-exposed soybean.

This study evaluated the effect of growing potato under legume intercrops on P uptake and use efficiency indices: P harvest index (PHI), P uptake efficiency (PuPE), P partial factor productivity (PPFP) and P partial balance (PPB). The experiment was carried out for four consecutive seasons with treatments comprising potato cultivated under legume intercrops: none (T1), dolichos (Lablab purpureus L) (T2), peas (Pisum sativum L) (T3) and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L) (T4). Across the seasons, the mean haulm P uptake for T2 (6.7 kg P ha(-1)), T4 (5.5) and T3 (4.5) were 6%, 23% and 36% lower than that observed in T1 (7.1 kg P ha(-1)), respectively. On the other hand, tuber P uptake was highest in T1 (21.8 kg P ha(-1)) and T2 (21.3 kg P ha(-1)) and were significantly higher than 13.2 kg P ha(-1) in T3 and 15.1 kg P ha(-1) in T4. This had a profound effect on PuPE, which was equally highest in T1 (0.26 kg total P uptake kg(-1) P supply) and T2 (0.25) and lowest in T3 (0.16) and T4 (0.18). Similarly, PPFP, PHI and PPB followed a similar trend, with highest values in T1 (57 kg tuber dry matter yield kg(-1) P supply, 76.4 kg tuber P uptake kg(-1) total plant's P uptake and 0.20 kg tuber P uptake kg(-1) P supply, respectively). Among the tested legume intercrops, dolichos competed least for P with the main crop (potato) hence it can be integrated into potato-based cropping systems without compromising potato tuber yield.

J2 exposure to different concentrations of bulb extracts caused 59-93% reduction in nematode reproduction on soybean roots. Compared with the monoculture control, soybean-N. tazetta intercropping in a pot trial reduced SCN reproduction by 37%.

This study was aimed at evaluating the diversity of AMF and their quantitative characteristics in ICLS-NT with intercropping between grasses and legumes in the pasture phase of the Cerrado of Mato Grosso, Brazil. The experimental area is located in Itiquira, MT, at Gravatai farm, on a dystrophic Red Latosol. The experimental design was a randomized block design in a split-plot arrangement and three replications, totaling approximately 60 ha. Plots were represented by the grasses Urochloa ruziziensis and Urochloa brizantha cv. BRS Paiaguos intercropped with the legumes (subplots) cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) cv. BRS Tumucumaque, pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) cv. BRS Mandarin, and grasses in monoculture. Spore density AMF was not influenced by cropping systems. The intercropping with legumes influenced mycorrhizal colonization AMF and inoculum potential in relation to monocropping. The highest diversity of species AMF occurred when grasses were intercropped. The highest yield was observed in the grass U. ruziziensis, regardless of the intercropping. In general, the intercropping of grasses and legumes positively influenced the mycorrhizal colonization, inoculum potential, diversity of AMF species, and yield of the evaluated grasses.

Minimum mean fruit drop were recorded for the intercrop Apple + Trifolium (2.87) which were significantly lower than all other intercrops including control (Apple sole). Likewise, minimum percent infestation (57.19%) were recorded for the Apple + Trifolium, whilst maximum 85.86% were observed in the Apple sole. Same intercrop was also good impact in curtailing C. pomonella mean moth catch (1.46) through traps and maximum percent parasitism of Ascogaster quadridentata (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and Hyssopus pallidus (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) were 40.11 and 30.09%, respectively, in the said cropping system. Likewise, highest yield (kg/plant) were produced by the plots having Apple + Trifolium intercrops (76.62 +/- 1.11), whilst minimum yield were attributed to Apple + Wheat (61.47 +/- 1.11) followed by sole (52.75 +/- 1.23). The results further confirmed that maximum yield losses (31.51%) were avoided by the intercrop Apple + Trifolium and gain in the yield (43.90%) over control was also featured to the same intercrop, whilst all other intercrops were inferior in avoiding the loses and gain in the yield.

Controlling soil erosion in smallholder potato farming systems using legume intercrops	GEODERMA REGIONAL			English	Article						"Grain legume intercrops; HUMIC NITISOIS; Nutrient losses; Runoff; Soil erosion; Soil loss"	"SOLANUM-TUBEROSUM-L.; ORGANIC-MATTER FRACTIONS; SURFACE-ROUGHNESS; SPLASH DETACHMENT; TILLAGE SYSTEMS; WATER; TEMPERATURE; RAINFALL; PHOSPHORUS; RUNOFF"	Soil and nutrient losses due to soil erosion are pronounced in potato growing areas of East Africa due largely to the rugged topography and high soil disturbance associated with potato cultivation. This study intercropped potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) with three grain legumes: lablab bean (Lublab purperous L.), garden pea (Pisum sativa L.) and climber bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in runoff plots and assessed their impact on soil and nutrient losses in central Kenya highlands. Bare plots and sole potato stands were included as controls. Vegetal cover was measured at different potato growth stages while runoff and soil loss were quantified at every runoff generating event and used for nutrient analyses. Yields were expressed as potato equivalents (PEY) at the end of each season. Mean cumulative sediment yield decreased from 169 t/ ha in sole potato plots to 50-83 t/ha in potato-legume intercropping, representing a reduction of 51-70%. The eroded sediment exported in large quantity the SOC (16.6-39.5 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1)), N (5.5-29.8 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), P (3.9-16.4 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1)) and K (5.2- 14.6 kg K ha(-1) yr(-1)) and were consistently higher in sole potato plots relative to potato-legume intercropping. These losses occurred mainly at potato emergence following fertilizer application. Stronger associations of sediment nutrient enrichments was found with the micro-aggregates (250-50 mu m) than with the macro-aggregates (>250 mu m) pointing to the different degree of nutrient mobilization and distribution in eroded sediment.The PEY were significantly greater in potato-lablab bean system than in sole potato, while intercropping with garden pea and climber bean showed similar PEY to that of sole potato, suggesting that potato-lablab system may be preferred by the smallholder farmers. These results justify the need to intercrop potato with indeterminate legume intercrops. a strategy that must be done in a way guaranteeing high yield stability to the smallholder farmers.

J	"Singh, K; Mishra, SK; Singh, V"				"Singh, Kuldeep; Mishra, Sudhir Kumar; Singh, Vikrant"			Sugarcane and Wheat Productivity Under Different Cropping Systems	SUGAR TECH			English	Article						"FIRB; Cropping system; Sugarcane; Wheat"	"GROWTH; HYBRID; CANE"	Under wheat- and sugarcane-based cropping system in North India, wheat is taken either as intercrop in autumn sugarcane or as a sole crop followed by sugarcane planting in summer months (April-May). The shading of wheat plants as intercrop adversely affects the emerging shoots of autumn sugarcane in March-April. Moreover, wheat yield is also less as an intercrop than its sole crop as only two rows of wheat are there in 90cm spaced autumn sugarcane. When sugarcane is planted after wheat harvesting, sugar and sugarcane yield is low due to less time available to late-planted cane. So, there is a need to develop production technologies for getting better cane and wheat yield under sugarcane-wheat cropping system. Furrow irrigated raised bed (FIRB) system may be a better option for higher productivity and net returns, as both the crops can be sown timely and gave better yields. To evaluate FIRB system, field experiments were conducted at Punjab Agricultural University, Regional Research Station, Faridkot, during 2011-2013, 2012-2014 and 2013-2015 in a randomized block design with nine treatments {T1: autumn sugarcane, T2: T1+wheat (1:2), T3: T1+wheat (1:3), T4: wheat sown in Novemberlate sugarcane, T5: wheat sown in Decemberlate sugarcane, T6: FIRB wheat November (75cm with three rows of wheat)+sugarcane in furrows in February, T7: FIRB wheat November (75cm with three rows of wheat)+sugarcane in furrows in March, T8: FIRB wheat December (75cm with three rows of wheat)+sugarcane in furrows in February, T9: FIRB wheat December (75cm with three rows of wheat)+sugarcane in furrows in March}. Wheat was taken as an intercrop and also as sole crop sown in November and December month, while sugarcane was also planted as sole autumn crop and as spring crop in furrows of standing wheat on beds (45cm) as wet planting method. The results showed that the average yield of wheat sown under FIRB system was 44.2q/ha that was significantly higher than the average yield (41.7q/ha) of bed sown wheat. Under FIRB system, both timely and late sown wheat with spring sugarcane (T7 and T8) produced higher number of millable canes, i.e., 107.2 and 105.8 thousands/ha, respectively, than remaining treatments, while cane yield (82t/ha) of timely sown wheat with sugarcane planted in furrow during the third week of February (T6) produced 2-40% more production than other treatments. This combination (T6) also recorded highwheat yield (49.6q/ha). Maximum cane equivalent yield was also obtained from T6 and T7 treatments. Thus, for getting high production from both crops, the FIRB system with three rows of wheat and furrow planted sugarcane during spring season can be advisable to the farmers for additional benefits with high monitory values.

Egypt is the largest wheat importer in the world and consumes an extensive amount of bread. It is imperative for wheat scientists to decrease the large gap between production and consumption. Wheat yields in Egypt increased 5.8-fold (6.7 billion kg) between 1961 and 2017 due to variety improvement and the use of better planting methods such as the raised bed method, ideal sowing date, surge flow irrigation and farm irrigation systems, laser levelling, fertilizers, and intercropping with raised beds. In this paper, the development of wheat production techniques and variety evolution over more than five decades in Egypt have been analyzed. In particular, we have focused on the technologies, cultural practices and causes for per unit area yield increase. The main purpose was to study the issues that have arisen during wheat production and to make recommendations for smart agricultural practices. In 1981, the yield was 3 300 kg ha(-1) and through the improvement of varieties, expansion of agricultural land and the adoption of modern agricultural techniques yield reached 6 500 kg ha(-1) by 2017. The production growth rate was 4.1% annually, and the total grain yield increased 4.3-fold, from 1.9 billion kg in 1981 to about 8.1 billion kg in 2017. The use of new improved varieties, new cultivation techniques, and modern irrigation techniques contributed to 97.0% of the increase in yield per unit area and 1.5% of the increase in yield was due to planting area expansion. Therefore, the increase in total yield mainly depended on the increase in yield per unit area. Wheat production in Egypt has been improved through the development of breeding and cultivation techniques. The use of these new techniques, the popularization of new high-quality seed varieties, and the use of the raised bed method instead of the old method of planting in basins have made the largest contributions to increased yield. In the future, wheat yield could be further increased by using the tridimensional uniform sowing mode and the development of wheat varieties that are resistant to rusts, deficit irrigation, and abiotic stress, that are highly adaptable to mechanized operation and have high yields. Based on our analysis, we propose the main technical requirements and measures to increase wheat yield in Egypt in the near future.

However, most soybean varieties use shade avoidance strategy to acquire more light absorption when suffered in canopy shade in intercropping systems, thus reduced the yield of the whole population on a farmland. The mechanisms underlying early response of soybean in shade avoidance is still largely unknown. Here we report our identification of differentially accumulated proteins in shade-sensitive soybean seedlings by global quantitative proteome analysis under white light (WL) and shade conditions. By using Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) labelling and HPLC fractionation followed by high-resolution LC-MS/MS analysis, 29 proteins were found up-regulated and 412 proteins were found down-regulated in soybean seedlings by 2-h shade stress than that by 2-h WL treatment. Multiple differentially expressed proteins are enriched in carbohydrate metabolic process especially in the biosynthetic pathways of cell wall polysaccharides in soybean seedlings by shade stress comparing to those in WL growth conditions. Physiological assays showed that saccharides were rapidly declined in shoot apex of soybean seedlings under a short-term shading.

Relative Performance of Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) based Intercropping Systems under Different Irrigation Levels	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						"Groundnut intercropping; Irrigation scheduling; Consumptive water use; Water use efficiency; Light interception"	"RADIATION USE EFFICIENCY; WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; LIGHT INTERCEPTION; YIELD; PRODUCTIVITY; STRESS; MANAGEMENT; VARIETIES"	The suitability of intercropping system relies on the appropriate selection of companion crop and adequate irrigation application for both crops to sustain and bloom. In this regard, this two-year field study was conducted to evaluate the performance of groundnut based intercropping systems with different irrigation levels on growth, yield, consumptive use, water use efficiency and light interception of groundnut. The intercropping systems included in the study were: sole groundnut, groundnut + castor, groundnut + blackgram, groundnut + sesame and groundnut + pearl millet. Irrigations scheduled as IW/CPE ratio of 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0 were assigned. Groundnut + blackgram and sole groundnut at IW/CPE 0.75 realized highest equivalent yield (2274 kg ha(-1)) and water use efficiency (4.85 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)) While, lowest equivalent yields were recorded in groundnut + pearl millet system at irrigation regime IW/CPE 0.50 (1413 kg ha(-1)). Similarly, higher consumptive water use was noticed under groundnut + pearl millet with highest at IW/CPE 1.0 irrigation regime. Higher mean light interception under groundnut + castor varied from 38.4% to 39.9% causing more shading effect on groundnut. Competitive and bio-economic indices indicated in favor of groundnut + blackgram under irrigation regime IW/CPE 0.75. The same system realized higher net income of 1238.60 $ ha(-1) with benefit: cost ratio of 3.00 over other treatments. Hence, groundnut + blackgram intercropping system periodically irrigated at IW/CPE 0.75 could enhance the productivity and profitability of the system.

The use of intercropped lucerne and wheat may comply with the directives. In the current study, the combination of ensiled lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) and wheat straw as substrate for hydrogen and methane production was investigated. Steam-pretreated and enzymatically hydrolysed wheat straw [WSH, 76% of total chemical oxygen demand (COD)] and ensiled lucerne (LH, 24% of total COD) were used for sequential hydrogen production through dark fermentation and methane production through anaerobic digestion and directly for anaerobic digestion. Synthetic co-cultures of extreme thermophilic Caldicellulosiruptor species adapted to elevated osmolalities were used for dark fermentation. Results: Based on 6 tested steam pretreatment conditions, 5 min at 200 degrees C was chosen for the ensiled lucerne. The same conditions as applied for wheat straw (10 min at 200 degrees C with 1% acetic acid) would give similar sugar yields. Volumetric hydrogen productivities of 6.7 and 4.3 mmol/L/h and hydrogen yields of 1.9 and 1.8 mol/mol hexose were observed using WSH and the combination of WSH and LH, respectively, which were relatively low compared to those of the wild-type strains. The combinations of WSH plus LH and the effluent from dark fermentation of WSH plus LH were efficiently converted to methane in anaerobic digestion with COD removal of 85-89% at organic loading rates of COD 5.4 and 8.5 g/L/day, respectively, in UASB reactors. The nutrients in the combined hydrolysates could support this conversion. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the possibility of reducing the water addition to WSH by 26% and the phosphorus addition by 80% in dark fermentation with Caldicellulosiruptor species, compared to previous reports. WSH and combined WSH and LH were well tolerated by osmotolerant co-cultures. The yield was not significantly different when using defined media or hydrolysates with the same concentrations of sugars. However, the sugar concentration was negatively correlated with the hydrogen yield when comparing the results to previous reports. Hydrolysates and effluents from dark fermentation can be efficiently converted to methane. Lucerne can serve as macronutrient provider in anaerobic digestion. Intercropping with wheat is promising.

For several years, there has been consistent import of different types of pulse-grains by India, despite having the largest area under cultivation and their total production. This paper focuses mainly on the production of pigeon pea, second most produced and consumed pulse after chickpea. There has been a major shift in the pigeon pea production in the country. The study is an attempt to examine the adoption of modern variety and other production practices in the highest pigeon pea producing state of India viz. Maharashtra. The marketing behaviour of the pigeon pea growers is also the focus area of this study. The pigeon pea production in India varied dramatically over the last five decades, in terms of its spread, productivity and its importance as an intercrop. At the farmers' level, there is a need for proper intervention in cropping patterns through new and improved crop varieties, information dissemination to farmers, mechanization and service support in reducing operational costs of farmers so as to increase the profitability from pigeon pea cultivation. The lot size and conveniences in terms of distance and time flexibility are some of the major influencers to decide about the marketing destination for the pigeon pea growers in the region.

A field study was conducted in Kabete, Kenya, during the 2014 to 2015 rainy seasons to determine the effect of sediment particle size distribution on SOM losses and to assess the SOM fractions most susceptible to soil erosion under potato-legume intercropping systems. The treatments comprised of bare soil, pure potato stand (sole potato), potato + garden pea (Pisum sativa), potato + climbing bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), and potato + dolichos lablab (Lablab purpureus). A combined aggregate size and density fractionation was used to separate the sediment in size classes of aggregates 53 to 250 mu m and in the sieve fraction <-53 mu m, while SOM was fractionated into particulate organic matter with a density of 1.65 to 1.85 g cm(-3) and mineral-associated SOM with a density of 2.60 g cm(-3). Sediment and organic matter enrichments varied significantly (p < 0.05) among the cropping systems and were consistently highest under sole potato and lowest under potato + dolichos. Soil particles were transported mainly as aggregates, with those in the < 53 mu m size fraction containing primary silt and clay particles. Stable fractions of SOM related positively with silt plus clay particles (r = 0.89; p < 0.01) and accounted for 95% of the total SOM losses. Vegetal cover (beta = -0.10508; p = 0.001603), splash detachment (beta = 0.00323; p = 0.039403), and their interactive effect (beta = -0.27327; p = 0.027224) influenced the amount and composition of SOM fractions at the aggregate level. Dolichos lablab ensured continuity of effective ground-cover and protected the organic matter against soil erosion, thus demonstrating the need to integrate indeterminate legume cover crops into potato cropping systems."

Here, we investigated the effects of seven intercropping systems [alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)/cucumber, trifolium (Trifolium repens L.)/cucumber, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/cucumber, rye (Secale cereale L.)/cucumber, chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum coronrium L.)/cucumber, rape (Brassica campestris L.)/cucumber, mustard (Brassica juncea L.)/cucumber] on soil bacterial and fungal communities compared to the cucumber continuous cropping system in the greenhouse. The results showed that intercropping increased microbial OTU richness and fungal communities diversity, soil bacterial communities diversity was abundant in the trifolium-cucumber and mustard-cucumber systems. Nevertheless, there was no significant differences of microbial communities structure between intercropping and monoculture systems. Redundancy analysis indicated that soil microbial communities composition was indirectly influenced by soil properties. In addition, network analysis demonstrated that simple inter-relationships of fungal taxa were observed in the intercropping soil, and trifolium, wheat, and mustard intercropping systems had a complex connection between bacterial taxa. Taken together, trifolium and mustard as the intercrops significantly increased cucumber continuous cropping soil bacterial and fungal communities diversity. Moreover, intercropping strongly changed the relationships of microbial taxa, though did not shape notably soil microbial communities structure.

In addition, a multilayered canopy created when intercropping species with different growth forms may limit germination cues for weed seeds and can allow for a more efficient utilization of resources that reduce competition to target crops from weeds. Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) was evaluated for its ability to reduce weeds in a low-input organic system in Texas when planted alone or in various intercropping combinations that also included peanut (Arachis hypogaea), okra (Abelmoschus esculentus), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), and hot pepper (Capsicum annuum). Watermelon significantly reduced total weed biomass when planted in monoculture and in all intercropping combinations compared with peanut, okra, cowpea, and pepper monocultures in year 1 of the 2-year study. Total weed biomass was reduced by 81%, 83%, 88%, and 92% in treatments containing watermelon on average as compared with pepper, peanut, okra, and cowpea grown in monoculture, respectively. Less effective weed suppression was obtained with watermelon in year 2. Pepper grown in monoculture had significantly higher weed biomass than all other treatments in year 2. Broadleaf weeds were effectively suppressed across all intercropping treatments in year 1, but nutsedges (Cyperus sp.) were consistently reduced both years, particularly when compared with monocrops with small leaf area such as pepper. The three and four species intercropping combinations consistently had high leaf area index (LAI) values, whereas pepper monoculture had significantly lower LAI values than all other treatments except for cowpea monoculture. There was a significant negative relationship between LAI and total weed biomass 33 d after last planting (r = -0.51, P < 0.01). There was a significant negative relationship between total weed biomass and total fruit yield in year 1 (r = -0.64, P < 0.01) but no significant relationship in year 2. Although findings were inconsistent in year 2 because of changes in precipitation amounts and in relative planting dates, these findings suggest that incorporating a multifunctional intercropping system that includes a low-growing vining crop such as watermelon or at least an architecturally complex mixture can optimize canopy density to reduce weed pressure from resilient perennial weeds such as nutsedge. This may offer organic producers another management tool for the control of perennial weeds.

Breeding pigeonpea cultivars for intercropping: synthesis and strategies	BREEDING SCIENCE			English	Review						"breeding cultivars; pigeonpea; intercrop; productivity enhancement; hybrid"	"CANDIDATE GENOMIC REGIONS; CAJANUS; IDENTIFICATION; TECHNOLOGY"	Pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] is an ideal pulse crop of rainfed tropics and sub-tropics due to its high nutritive value and ability to survive various biotic and abiotic stresses. Thus it has continued to be cultivated on marginal land mostly under rainfed situation where the risk of crop failure is very high. To have insurance against crop failures and harvest more food in time and space, most farmers grow pigeonpea as an intercrop with short-aged cereals and other crops. Presently, intercropping system accounts for over 70% of the pigeon pea area. However, yield of pigeonpea in this system is very low (400-500 kg/ha). The non-availability of improved cultivars adapted specifically to the intercropping environments is perhaps the major constraint that accounts for low yield. Considering the food and nutritional needs of the ever increasing population, productivity enhancement of this high-protein pulse is highly indispensable. In this review, the authors critically examine the technical difficulties encountered by breeders in developing high yielding cultivars for inter cropping systems and discuss the strategies to overcome these constraints.

JOURNAL OF CENTRAL EUROPEAN AGRICULTURE			Polish	Article						"caraway; intercropping; production profitability; soil productivity"	ESSENTIAL OIL	A study was carried out in 2013-2014 on caraway (Carum carvi L.), which is a biennial plant grown alone or together with a spring crop. The aim of the study was an agrotechnical and economic assessment of technologies for intercropping of caraway with selected three species of spring crops. The study showed that the highest caraway fruit yields in the second year were obtained in the variant in which the species was grown together with field pea. The profitability of this variant was increased by area-based subsidies for legumes and reduced outlays for mineral fertilizers. The highest value for pea as a species intercropped with caraway was confirmed by economic indicators such as soil productivity, net farm income, and production profitability. The second most suitable crop for intercropping with caraway was dill. It has similar agrotechnical requirements as caraway, but has the disadvantage of a very late harvest time, which slows the development of the main crop and reduces the yield of caraway the following year. In this variant lower values were obtained for the economic indicators than in the case of caraway grown with pea. The least suitable species for intercropping with caraway proved to be white mustard, whose intensive growth and accompanying high demand for water, nutrients and light substantially limited the development and yield of caraway. Due to the relatively low caraway yield and high cost of mustard cultivation, this variant resulted in the lowest economic indicators.

Hence, this study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of mulch and biofertilizer application on yield and yield components, oil quantity and quality of purslane in different cropping systems. Two experiments were carried out with factorial arrangement based on randomized complete block design with three replications in 2015 and 2016. The first factor was cropping systems including Portulaca oleracea L. and Lallemantia iberica Fischer & C.A. Meyer sole cropping, the additive intercropping of purslane/dragon's head (P100/D20, D40 and D60 %); the second factor was mulch application including with (+M) or without (-M) wheat straw mulch; the third factor was two types of fertilization including application of 100% chemical fertilizer (F-1) and 50% chemical + biological fertilizers (F-2). The mulching significantly affected yield, yield components, oil content and omega-3 fatty acid of purslane. The highest value of omega-3 fatty acid was observed in mulched plants. Sole cropping of purslane increased number of capsule and seed yield. The highest land equivalent ratio (1.56) was observed in D40+P100 intercropped with mulch application and 50% chemical + biological fertilizers in 2016. Therefore, the organic intercropped system with mulching is applicable in the medicinal plant production such as purslane in order to reach sustainable agricultural goals."

"The double-cropping system of wheat and cotton is widely adopted in the Yellow River Valley of China, but it remains unclear if and how planting patterns impact cotton yield and economic benefits in this system. Using monoculture cotton (CM) as the control, we conducted a 2-year field experiment to investigate the effects of three planting patterns, cotton intercropped with wheat (CIW), cotton transplanted after wheat (CTW), and cotton direct-seeded after wheat (CDW) under the wheat-cotton double cropping system on cotton growth, yield and economic benefits in two fields differing in soil fertility. The results indicated that double cropping significantly decreased cotton yield relative to monoculture irrespective of planting pattern and fields, but the decrements were considerably reduced in the high soil fertility field. Averaged across two years, cotton yields of CIW, CTW and CDW were reduced by 16.2, 30.0 and 38.8% in the low fertility field relative to that of CM, while they were reduced by 7.5, 22.4 and 22.7% in the high fertility field. The yield difference among planting patterns was attributed to the variation in both the number of bolls and boll weight, while the yield difference between two fields was largely due to the number of bolls. Similar differences in biomass accumulation were observed among planting patterns. Accelerated early development of cotton, extended duration of the fast biomass accumulation and the enhanced total biomass and accumulation rate were observed in the high fertility relative to those in the low fertility field. Economic analysis showed that, based on total costs and output values of two crops, the net revenue of CIW, CTW and CDW was increased by 28.5, 10.9 and 36.5% in the low fertility field; and by 56.3, 31.8 and 74.4% in the high fertility field, compared to CM averaged by two years. CDW might be a new alternative for cotton production in Yellow River Valley when taking both profitability and management simplification into consideration. Our results also support that good soil fertility is a prerequisite for high yield and net return in wheat-cotton double cropping, especially for CDW."

An experiment was conducted across 6 site-years in New York and Maryland in 2013 and 2014 to examine the effects of functional diversity and crop species richness on weed suppression. We compared four annual crop species that differed in stature and nitrogen acquisition traits: (1) pearl millet, (2) sorghum sudangrass, (3) cowpea, and (4) sunn hemp. Crops were seeded in monoculture and in three- and four-species mixtures using a replacement design in which monoculture seeding rates were divided by the number of species in the intercrop. Crop and weed biomass were sampled at similar to 45 and 90 d after planting. At the first sampling date, intercrops produced more crop biomass than monocultures in all but 1 site-year; however, weed biomass in intercrops was lower than monocultures in only 1 site-year. By the second sampling date, crop biomass was consistently greater in the intercrops than in the monocultures, and weed biomass was lower in the intercrops than in monocultures in 2 site-years. Although we observed several negative relationships between crop species richness and weed biomass, crop biomass was a more important factor than species richness for suppressing weeds. Despite the weak weed suppression from the two legumes compared with the two grasses, legume crops can provide other benefits, including increased forage quality, soil nitrogen for subsequent crops, and resources for pollinators if allowed to flower. On the other hand, if weed suppression is the top priority, our results suggest that monocultures of high biomass-producing grasses will provide more effective suppression at a lower seed cost than functionally diverse intercrops that include low biomass-producing legumes in warm-season intercrops."

Rare available resources demonstrate intercropping legumes and brassicas as beneficial to both, especially for the latter, profiting from better nitrogen nutrition. Our team aimed at designing a scheme of the intercrops of autumnand spring-sown annual legumes with brassicas for ruminant feeding and green manure, and has carried out a set of field trials in a temperate Southeast European environment and during the past decade, aimed at assessing their potential for yields of forage dry matter and aboveground biomass nitrogen and their economic reliability via land equivalent ratio. This review provides a cross-view of the most important deliverables of our applied research, including eight annual legume crops and six brassica species, demonstrating that nearly all the intercrops were economically reliable, as well as that those involving hairy vetch, Hungarian vetch, Narbonne vetch and pea on one side, and fodder kale and rapeseed on the other, were most productive in both manners. Feeling encouraged that this pioneering study may stimulate similar analyses in other environments and that intercropping annual legume and brassicas may play a large-scale role in diverse cropping systems, our team is heading a detailed examination of various extended research.

In these systems, legumes are a key functional group, and are highly valued for the agroecological services they provide. This review identifies the different complementarity and facilitation processes in soils in intercropped legume/cereal systems and the key role of soil microorganisms in these processes. The intercropped legumes/cereal systems reduce inter-specific competition by enhancing complementarity/facilitation processes thereby improving the exploitation of resources, which is, in turn, reflected in the increase in plant production corresponding to greater efficiency of the agroecosystem as a whole. Plant production, including above- and belowground biomass, is positively correlated with microbial abundance and diversity. This microbial life is assumed to play a significant role in the availability and transfer of soil nutrients to plants as well as in plant health and soil fertility. Although we are currently unable to identify a reliable and exhaustive pattern of plant-microbe interactions, perhaps simply because no universal relationship exists between plants and microorganisms, reliable scenarios reveal strong trends and define the conditions required for successful intercropping systems and microbial interactions. Given our incomplete knowledge of facilitation processes and belowground interactions, intercropping systems must learn from and apply the experience gained in successful experiments.

This study aimed to optimise the composition of these crops for three climatically contrasting areas. Four legumes (field pea of semi-dwarf and tall type; Narbon vetch; common vetch) and two cereals (oat; triticale) were grown in three autumn-sown sites (Sassari, Italy; Setif, Algeria; Marchouch, Morocco) for 2 years as pure stands and legume-cereal binary and four-component mixtures. We assessed dry matter yield, weed content and farmers' acceptability of the crops, and legume content and Land Equivalent Ratio of the mixtures. Legumes' competitive disadvantage ranged from very high in Setif to nearly nil in Sassari. Pea- and common vetch-based mixtures out-performed Narbon vetch-based ones in terms of yield, legume content and farmers' acceptability. The tall pea, featuring greatest competitive ability against cereals, maximised the yield and legume content of legume-cereal crops. Vetch-cereal mixtures exhibited lower weed content than the average of the components' pure stands. Oat monoculture was top-yielding but modestly appreciated by farmers. Pea provided the only legume monoculture combining good yielding ability and high farmers' appreciation. Greater species diversity as provided by complex mixtures did not display any production advantage over binary mixtures."

The second one determined on-farm bale variance within and across locations. Clustering NIRS data indicated that chemical signatures differed among locations and N-levels, but less so among intercrops. Results suggest that homogeneity may vary within a region responsible for supplying biomass to a biorefinery. Thus, conversion efficiencies and enzymatic requirements for ethanol production may be affected.

Although CP extracts or essential oils have been reported to be efficient in disturbing the settling of insects such as aphids, the effect of using actual CPs remains relatively unknown. Our aim was to screen odorous CP species for their effect on the performance of green peach aphid, Myzus persicae Sulzer (Hemiptera: Aphididae), when released on adjacent pepper plants. Intercropping was tested in growth chambers using potted plants to avoid root interactions and homogenise the abiotic environment of CPs. Our results indicated that eight CP species-rosemary, African marigold, French marigold, geranium, lavender, basil, chives, and pot marigold-affected aphid performance by reducing the reproductive performance and/or settlement of females. Rosemary followed by African and French marigold was associated with the largest reduction in adult female and nymph number. Chemical analyses indicated that rosemary and French marigold emit specific volatiles. In contrast, four CP species (false yellowhead, thyme, savoury, and peppermint) were not associated with a significant change in aphid performance and emitted a lower diversity of volatiles. This screening of CPs under controlled conditions may be considered as a first step towards the identification of volatiles emitted by actual plants that can affect aphid performance and help the choice of CPs to optimise intercropping strategies.

Physiological disorders and insect-transmitted diseases are major problems for squash growers in semi-tropical regions around the world. Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) biotype B is a significant whitefly pest and is largely responsible for transmitting viruses and causing physiological disorders in squash. Several studies have shown that whitefly populations are reduced when crops are interplanted with non-host cover crops or mulches. The aim of the present study was to determine how the presence of buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum Moench, and a key predator, Delphastus catalinae (Horn), affect whitefly colonization on squash. RESULTS: Whitefly densities were higher on squash than on buckwheat. The introduction of D. catalinae on squash significantly reduced whitefly populations. Overall, there were higher densities of D. catalinae on squash where the whitefly pest was more concentrated compared with buckwheat. CONCLUSION: The study provided preliminary evidence that D. catalinae, when used in conjunction with buckwheat as a living mulch, may aid in reducing whiteflies in squash. This greenhouse experiment highlights the need to investigate a multitactic approach of intercropping buckwheat with squash and the incorporation of D. catalinae in the field to manage populations of whiteflies and whitefly-transmitted diseases.

Photosynthetic performance of soybean plants to water deficit under high and low light intensity	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						"Water deficit; Shaded soybean; Exposed soybean; Chlorophyll; Photosynthetic rate"	"CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; DROUGHT STRESS; FOOD SECURITY; GAS-EXCHANGE; SHADE; PHOTOINHIBITION; TOLERANCE; CULTIVARS; RESPONSES; SEEDLINGS"	The two major challenges to relay strip intercropping soybean production in Southwest China are drought and lowlight intensity. This study tests whether the impact of drought on the photosynthetic performance of soybean plants is different between low and high light intensity conditions. To investigate this, soybean plants were grown in pots in a factorial experiment at two irrigation regimes (75 +/- 2% and 45 +/- 2% of soil field capacity) and two light intensity treatments (100% and 65% light intensity) in 2011. In 2012, soybean plants were grown in two irrigation regimes (75 +/- 2% of soil field capacity vs. progressive soil drying) and two light intensity treatments (sole cropping soybean and relay strip intercropping soybean). Photosynthetic performance was assessed by measuring parameters such as net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs), water use efficiency (WUE), which were decreased significantly in drought stressed plants. We also observed differences in the photosynthetic responses of soybean plants to drought depending on the light intensity treatment the plants were subjected to. Shaded soybean plants in response to drought conditions had increased chlorophyll a (Chl a), chlorophyll b (Chl b), chlorophyll (Chl), carotenoid (Car), ratio of Car/Chl, leaf relative water content (RLWC), leaf area per plant, specific leaf area (SLA), Pn, Gs, intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), transpiration rate (Tr), photochemical quenching (qP) and electron transport rate (ETR). The above-mentioned photosynthetic changes may play an important role in determining how shaded soybean plants adjust their photosynthetic rate when experiencing drought conditions. (C) 2016 SAAB.

However, little information is available on the nitrogen (N) utilization and requirement of cotton under wheat-cotton rotations. This study was to determine the N uptake and use efficiency by evaluating the cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) N use and the soil N balances, which will help to improve N resource management in wheat-cotton rotations. Field experiments were conducted during 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 growing seasons in the Yangtze River region in China. Two cotton cultivars (Siza 3, mid-late maturity with 130 days growth duration; CCRI 50, early maturity with 110 days growth duration) were planted under four cropping systems including monoculture cotton (MC), wheat/intercropped cotton (W/IC), wheat/transplanted cotton (W/TC) and wheat/direct-seeded cotton (W/DC). The N uptake and use efficiency of cotton were quantified under different cropping systems. The results showed that wheat-cotton rotations decreased the cotton N uptake through reducing the N accumulation rate and shortening the duration of fast N accumulation phase as compared to the monoculture cotton. Compared with MC, the N uptake of IC, TC and DC were decreased by 12.0%, 20.5% and 23.4% for Siza 3, respectively, and 7.3%, 10.7% and 17.6% for CCRI 50, respectively. Wheat-cotton rotations had a lower N harvest index as a consequence of the weaker sink capacity in the cotton plant caused by the delayed fruiting and boll formation. Wheat-cotton rotations used N inefficiently relative to the monoculture cotton, showing consistently lower level of the N agronomic use efficiency (NAE), N apparent recovery efficiency (NRE), N physiological efficiency (NPE) and N partial factor productivity (NPFP), particularly for DC. Relative to the mid-late maturity cultivar of Siza 3, the early maturity cultivar of CCRI 50 had higher N use efficiency in wheat-cotton rotations. An analysis of the crop N balance suggested that the high N excess in preceding wheat (Triticum aestivum L) in wheat-cotton rotations led to significantly higher N surpluses than the monoculture cotton. The N management for the cotton in wheat-cotton rotations should be improved by means of reducing the base fertilizer input and increasing the bloom application. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, higher productivity must be reached through sustainable production by taking into account climate change, resources rarefaction like phosphorus and water, and losses of fertile lands. Enhancing crop diversity is increasingly recognized as a crucial lever for sustainable agro-ecological development. Growing legumes, a major biological nitrogen source, is also a powerful option to reduce synthetic nitrogen fertilizers use and associated fossil energy consumption. Organic farming, which does not allow the use of chemical, is also regarded as one prototype to enhance the sustainability of modern agriculture while decreasing environmental impacts. Here, we review the potential advantages of eco-functional intensification in organic farming by intercropping cereal and grain legume species sown and harvested together. Our review is based on a literature analysis reinforced with integration of an original dataset of 58 field experiments conducted since 2001 in contrasted pedo-climatic European conditions in order to generalize the findings and draw up common guidelines. The major points are that intercropping lead to: (i) higher and more stable grain yield than the mean sole crops (0.33 versus 0.27 kg m(-2)), (ii) higher cereal protein concentration than in sole crop (11.1 versus 9.8 %), (iii) higher and more stable gross margin than the mean sole crops (702 versus 577 a,not signaEuro parts per thousand ha(-1)) and (iv) improved use of abiotic resources according to species complementarities for light interception and use of both soil mineral nitrogen and atmospheric N-2. Intercropping is particularly suited for low-nitrogen availability systems but further mechanistic understanding is required to propose generic crop management procedures. Also, development of this practice must be achieved with the collaboration of value chain actors such as breeders to select cultivars suited to intercropping.

J	"Franco, JG; King, SR; Masabni, JG; Volder, A"				"Franco, Jose G.; King, Stephen R.; Masabni, Joseph G.; Volder, Astrid"			Plant functional diversity improves short-term yields in a low-input intercropping system	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"Agroecology; Biodiversity; Functional groups; Intercropping; Land equivalent ratio; Sustainable agriculture"	"BIODIVERSITY; PRODUCTIVITY; COMPETITION; COMPLEMENTARITY"	In natural ecosystems, plant communities composed of functionally diverse species produce more biomass overall than less diverse communities. This increased biomass production is thought to occur due to complementary use of resources such as nutrients and water, and facilitation during sub-optimal environmental conditions. Using the same concept in a crop setting may lead to increased yield (overyielding) in diverse cropping systems when compared to monocultures. Different combinations of peanut, watermelon, okra, cowpea, and pepper planted alone arm various intercropping combinations were investigated over two growing seasons in a low-input system in the peak of summer heat in Texas. Each species was selected to perform a specific function within the system. Results from land equivalent ratio (LER) indicate that the within-row combination with peanut, watermelon and okra (W-pwo) and peanut, watermelon, okra and cowpea (W-pwoc.,) consistently overyielded in 2011 and 2012. LER values were 1.17 each for W-pwo and W-pwoc in 2011 and 1.17 and 1.20 in 2012, respectively. In 2011, watermelon was the dominant crop and was up-regulated in all intercropping combinations while all other component crops were down-regulated. Watermelon per plant production was significantly higher in the combination containing all species (W-all) when compared to its monoculture, 5.50 and 2.09 kg(fruit) plant(-1), respectively. In 2012, okra was the dominant crop and was up-regulated in all intercropping combinations while watermelon, cowpea, and pepper were down-regulated. Okra per plant production was significantly higher in W-pwoc and W-all than in monoculture, 2.28, 2.46, and 1.13 kg(fruit) plant(-1), respectively. These findings suggest that three and four species intercropping combinations, whereby each crop is selected to perform a specific function within the system, may provide small-scale sustainably-minded producers a model system that can be utilized in suboptimal conditions and allow them to reduce inputs while increasing overall yields.

Here we study planting density and growth regulator effects on plant structure and production of cotton when the cotton is grown in a relay intercrop with wheat, a cultivation system that is widespread in China. Field experiments were carried out in 2010,2011 and 2012 in Anyang, Henan province, China. Plant densities (PD) were 3.0, 4.5,6.0 and 7.5 plants m(-2), and growth regulator mepiquat chloride (MC) was applied in four different schedules. Plant density significantly affected cotton biomass, but MC did not. Aboveground biomass was linearly associated with plant density. Increasing plant density significantly increased crop light use efficiency, especially during the reproductive phase. This effect was attributed to a better light distribution in the canopy, resulting in higher crop photosynthesis. MC increased the partitioning to leaves, expressed as leaf/shoot ratio. Plant height and length of fruit branches were significantly reduced by MC, resulting in a more compact canopy. Maximum leaf area index was slightly lowered at higher MC dose, but MC did not significantly affect light interception. Plant density and MC showed a significant interaction effect on crop height, but not on leaf growth, biomass or lint yield. At high plant densities, 3-4 consecutive applications of MC improved plant architecture, resulting in a higher LUE and yield. Lint yields were about 10% higher with MC applied at a high cumulative dose with high plant densities compared to MC free control. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effects of Transgenic Cotton-Based Cropping Systems and Their Fertility Levels on Succeeding Wheat Crop	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS			English	Article						"Apparent balance; Bt cotton; FYM; groundnut; nitrogen; organic carbon; wheat"	"BT-COTTON; SOIL FERTILITY; NITROGEN; PRODUCTIVITY; MANAGEMENT; PHOSPHORUS; VERTISOLS; LEGUMES; INDEXES; MATTER"	Cotton wheat is the second most important cropping system after rice wheat in India and Pakistan, and is practiced on about 4.02 mha. By 2010, more than 6 million Indian farmers had adopted transgenic Bt cotton on 9.4 mha almost 90% of the country's total cotton area. There is a paucity of information on the effects of intercropping and integrated nitrogen (N) management practices in transgenic Bt cotton on productivity, nutrient availability, and soil biological properties in the succeeding wheat crop in a cotton wheat system. A study was made to evaluate and quantify the residual effect of two-tiered intercropping of cotton and groundnut with substitution of 25-50% recommended dose of nitrogen (RDN) of cotton by farmyard manure (FYM) on productivity and soil fertility in a cotton wheat system at New Delhi during 2006-2008. Wheat following groundnut-intercropped cotton receiving 50% RDN substitution through FYM had significantly 5% greater grain yield than that after sole cotton. Residual soil fertility in terms of organic carbon (C), potassium permanganate (KMn04)-N, and dehydrogenase activity (14%) showed an improvement under cotton + groundnut wheat system with substitution of 50% RDN of cotton by FYM. Apparent N balance as well as actual change in KMn04-N at wheat harvest was negative in most of the treatments, with greater loss (-58.1) noticed under pure stand of the cotton wheat system with 100% RDN of cotton through urea. The study suggested that inclusion of legume and organic manure in transgenic Bt-cotton wheat system is a sustainable practice for combating escalating prices of N fertilizers with environmental issues and instability of transgenic hybrids in south Asian countries.

WITHIN PLANT DISTRIBUTION AND DYNAMICS OF HYADAPHIS FOENICULI (HEMIPTERA: APHIDIDAE) IN FIELD FENNEL INTERCROPPED WITH NATURALLY COLORED COTTON	FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST			English	Article						"Fennel; Hyadaphis foeniculi; cotton with colored fibers; intercropping system; dynamics; behavior"	"APHIS-GOSSYPII; ESSENTIAL OILS; CONSTITUENTS; ECOLOGY"	Intercropping fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.) with naturally colored cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) may provide a beneficial socioeconomic, ecological and environmental alternative for recuperating agribusiness in fennel and cotton cultivations in northeast Brazil because these crops do not compete for nutrients. The objectives of this study were to investigate the vertical and horizontal distribution of Hyadaphis foeniculi (Pass.) within fennel plants and its population dynamics in fennel crops and fennel intercropped with naturally colored cotton as a function of plant age during 2 fennel seasons by examining plants throughout the entire growing seasons. The vertical and horizontal distributions and the dynamics of the fennel aphids on the monocultured fennel and fennel intercropped with cotton were determined at intervals of 7 days, sampling 5 whole plants per plot from 55 days after transplanting the fennel seedlings until the first harvest (195 days after transplanting). The vertical distribution of apterous or alate aphids on the fennel plants evidenced no significant interactions within the cropping system, plant age, or vertical region of the plant, or between the cropping system and the vertical region of the plant. However for the number of fennel aphids per plant, there was an interaction between cropping system and plant age (apterous aphids) and between plant age and vertical region of the plant (apterous or alate aphids). In the fennel system, the apterous aphid population peaked at 153 and 188 days after transplanting, whereas the alate aphid population peaked at 139 and 174 days after transplanting. In the intercropped fennel/cotton system, the apterous aphid population peaked at 188 days after transplanting, and the alate aphid population peaked at 195 days after transplanting. The numbers of apterous aphids found per fennel plant in the monocultured fennel for the entire study were significantly higher than the numbers found in the fennel-cotton intercropped system. The results of our study are extremely important for understanding the vertical and horizontal distribution of H. foeniculi on fennel plants in both monoculture and the fennel-cotton intercropping system and may be useful in decision-making in relation to implementing controls and determining the timing of population peaks of this important fennel pest.

The experiment was laid out in Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications. Populations of aphids, ladybird beetles and syrphid flies were counted from each plant of one square feet of wheat. The maximum population of aphids was observed on plots not trap cropped with lucern. The establishment of beneficial insects on lucern harbouring aphids helped to delimit the aphid population in intercropped wheat plots and maintained them below economic injury level. This reveals the role of trap cropping of fodder crops in wheat to decrease the insecticide application chances on this cereal crop of great importance.

We compared biomass production, N uptake and N-fixation of RCG in monoculture and mixtures of RCG with alsike clover (Trifolium hybridum L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), goat's rue (Galega orientalis Lam.) and kura clover (Trifolium ambiguum M. Bieb.). In one experiment, RCG was also undersown in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Three fertilization treatments were applied: 100 kg N ha-1, 50 kg N ha-1 and 50 kg N ha-1 + RCG ash/sewage sludge. We used a delayed harvest method: cutting the biomass in late autumn, leaving it on the field during the winter and harvesting in spring. The legume biomass of the mixtures at the inland experimental site was small and did not affect RCG growth negatively. At the coastal site, competition from higher amount of clover biomass affected RCG growth and spring yield negatively. N-fixation in red clover and alsike clover mixtures in the first production year approximately covered half of recommended N-fertilization rate. Goat's rue and kura clover did not establish well at the costal site, but at the inland site goat's rue formed a small but vital undergrowth. RCG undersown in barley gave lower yield, both in autumn and spring, than the other treatments. The high N treatment gave a higher spring yield at the inland site than the low N treatments, but there were no differences due to fertilization treatments at the coastal site. For spring harvest, there were no yield benefits of RCG/legume intercropping compared with RCG monoculture. However, intercropping might be more beneficial in a two-harvest system."

The objective was to evaluate the effect of some chemical fertilizers on productivity and nutritive value of Sorghum Sudanense Var. Panar intercropped with Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp) in an adverse condition of soil and irrigation water. The chemical fertilizers applied were 50 kg/ha of urea (46% N), 50 kg/ha of triple superphosphate (46% P), 50 kg/ha of KNO3, 50 kg/ha of NPK (20:20:40) and a control for check. Sudan grass and Cowpea were sown as sole crops and as a mixture. Treatments were laid out in a split plot design with the fertilizer treatments in the main plots and the intercropping treatments in the subplots. Parameters measured were plant height and nutritive value for the Sudan grass, fresh and dry yields and the land equivalent ratio (LER). The chemical fertilizers had no significant (P <= 0.05) effect on productivity but significantly improved forage quality. Intercropping of Sudan grass and Cowpea significantly (P <= 0.05) increased forage productivity and improved forage quality and land equivalent ratio (LER). Cowpea was not a good competitor as it disappeared following the first cut in the first season.

Effect of preceding and intercropping crops on suppression of lentil damping-off and root rot disease in New Valley - Egypt	CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						"Damping-off; Intercropping; Lentil; Root exudates; Root rot; Preceding crops"	"RHIZOCTONIA-SOLANI; FUSARIUM-WILT; SOIL; ROTATION; GROWTH"	Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium solani were isolated from diseased lentil roots showing damping-off and root rot collected from different locations of New Valley governorate. R. solani isolate R-1 and F. solani isolate FS-9 were the highest virulent isolates. The influence of some agricultural factors on severity of damping-off and root rot disease was studied under greenhouse and field conditions. Intercropping cumin, anise, onion and garlic significantly decreased damping-off and root rot disease and increased seed yield. Anise has the greater effect than other crops, while intercropping onion showed the lowest effect. All tested preceding crops planted before lentil decreased disease severity and population of the tested fungi except in case of soybean and groundnut which increased percentage of disease severity as well as populations of the tested fungi in soil. Cowpea and gaur cultivated before lentil gave the highest decrease in disease severity. On the other hand, lentil cultivated after cowpea produced the highest seed yield followed by gaur and millet. Lowest seed yield production was recorded when plants were cultivated after soybean followed by sesame and groundnut. The lowest population of R. solani was recorded when cowpea cultivated before lentil, while, cultivating sorghum before lentil resulted in the lowest population of F. solani. Root exudates of intercropping and preceding crops reduced mycelial dry weight of the tested fungi in vitro except groundnut and soybean. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

With the objective to identify, in the pasture-agriculture integration system, the variations of soil physical attributes and yield of soybean on brachiaria straw, the present work was conducted at the FEPE-UNESP of Ilha Solteira, SP. The randomized block experimental design was used, with nine treatments in the fatorial scheme 3x3, with four repetitions. The treatments consisted of three species of brachiaria and a consortium of the three types of brachiaria with corn. The physical properties of soil were determined before the installation of the experimente, after the harvest of corn intercropped with forage and after the harvest of soybeans. In summer the soybean crop was sown on the straw of corn and brachiaria spaced 0.45 m, with 14 lines per plot and area for data collection consisting of 4 lines of 5 m each. The results showed that intercropping and sequence of crops provided increase of soil macroporosity and total porosity. Brachiaria brizantha sown at the time of top-dressing of corn and Brachiaria decumbens sown in line promoted higher yields of soybeans.	"[Chioderoli, Carlos A.; Furlani, Carlos E.

Study was conducted in district Sheikhupura, Pakistan during cropping session 2006-07 and 2007-08 at three different sites. Four treatments viz., T1 = a Brassica strip of 0.6x67m (40.2 m(-2)), T2 = a Brassica strip of 1.21x67m (81.7 m(-2)) area, T3 = a Brassica strip of 1.82x67m (121.94 m(-2)) area, T4 = a Brassica strip of 3.65x67m (244.55 m(-2)) area and control (sole wheat crop was sown) were used in the study. During the study significant difference in number of aphids per tillers was observed among treatments. Highest number of aphids per tiller was recorded in control wheat plot, while lowest in the plot (T4). Highest number of Coccinellids, Cluysoperla carnea and araneae (spiders) was recorded in T4 while lowest in control. The maximum 1000-grain weight was recorded in T4 treatment (42.80g) while minimum in control treatment (36.57g). However, T3 treatment showed highest yield (5468kg/ha) followed by T2. The treatment T3 showed highest cost benefit ratio value (1:1.95) while lowest cost benefit ratio (1:1.77) was observed in T4. It is concluded that strip cropping of Brassica napus in wheat fields increases predator's population which suppress the aphids population, and enhances the yield.

ROOTS	ACTA SCIENTIARUM POLONORUM-HORTORUM CULTUS			English	Article						"scorzonera; intercrop plants; term of ploughing; ridges; inulin; protein"	COVER CROPS	Intensification in plant growing is a direct reason for deteriorating soil properties, as well as conditions of plant growth and development. Aiming at improvement of soil fertility and structure, conservation tillage, limiting the processes of soil environment degradation, is introduced into garden crop production techniques. Field experiments were conducted in the years 2006-2008, on grey brown podzolic soil of impermanent structure. The experimental plant was scorzonera (Scorzonera hispanica L.) of 'Duplex' cultivar. Three intercrop plants were considered in the studies: common vetch (Vicia saliva L.), phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia B.) and oats (Avena saliva L.). There were also two ways of pre-sowing soil tillage: a) complex of pre-sowing practices, sowing of intercrop plant (2(nd) decade of August), pre-winter ploughing and putting green matter into soil, b) complex of pre-sowing practices, sowing of intercrop plant (2(nd) decade of August), spring ploughing and putting plant matter into soil, as well as two plant growing methods: on ridges and on flat soil. Significantly advantageous effects of spring putting intercrops into soil, growing of scorzonera on ridges and ploughing the soil with oats upon the total root yield were demonstrated. The examined experiment factors, however, did not significantly affect inulin, protein and dry matter contents in scorzonera roots. The most favorable tillage combination, as to inulin productivity was growing of scorzonera on ridges after spring ploughing oats with soil.

Intercropping wheat and potato can effectively reduce wind erosion, soil desertification and degradation. In this paper, a quantitative research on effective resistance width to wind erosion for the wheat and potato intercropping farmland was performed using several 8-channel wind speed samplers and a movable wind tunnel. As can be seen from the test results, the effective width to control wind erosion for conventional tillage strips on wheat and potato intercropping farmland was lower than or equal to 5 m as the wind speed at 2 m height was 6-7 ms(-1). Moreover, the effective width to control wind erosion of conservation tillage strips on wheat and potato intercropping farmland should be greater than or equal to 5.5 m. Therefore, wheat and potato intercropping with suitable strip width is a cropping mode that not only protects farmland soil from wind erosion to the utmost but also satisfies the requirements of regional planting structure.

Economic analysis of the intercropping of lettuce and tomato in different seasons under protected cultivation	HORTICULTURA BRASILEIRA			English	Article						"Lactuca sativa; Lycopersicon esculentum; intercropping; protected cultivation; economic feasibility; profitability"		"Lettuce and tomato are vegetables that can be grown in protected cultivation, under given conditions. Considering their expensive production systems, intercropping might be an excellent alternative to optimize costs. Four experiments were carried out at the Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), at Jaboticabal, Brazil, to study the economic viability of intercropping lettuce and tomato under protected cultivation. To set the intercropping, lettuce was transplanted 0, 10, 20, and 30 days after transplanting (DAT) tomato and vice-versa, in two seasons, namely April to September 2003 and January to June 2004, when monocultures of both vegetables were also carried out. At the first planting season, operational profits (OP) in intercropping (lettuce transplanted 0, 10, and 20 DAT tomato) were higher than in monocultures. At the first season, the return rates (RR) and OP were very much alike, whereas at the second season, RR in intercropping were lower than in monoculture. Transplanting tomato after lettuce, at both the first and second seasons, resulted in higher OP than those in monocultures. RR, OP and the profitability index (PI) were higher at the first than at the second season, independent of the growing system. RR in intercropping, independently of the intercropping schedule, were higher than in monoculture. In general, PI of tomato in monoculture and in intercropping were quite similar and both were higher than PI in the monoculture of lettuce. The economic indexes confirmed the agronomic viability (expressed by the index of area use efficiency) of transplanting lettuce and tomato simultaneously in both growing seasons; transplanting lettuce 10 and 20 DAT tomato, in the second season; and transplanting tomato after lettuce in all studied schedules. The economic indexes reached their peaks when tomato and lettuce were transplanted at the same day, in the first growing season (in average): OP of BRL$ 12,948.63 (US$ 4,273.48) in 614.4 m(-2); RR of 6.7% and IP of 85%."

Here, two winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L) cultivars, Yangmai 158 (shading tolerant) and Yangmai 11 (shading sensitive), were shaded from jointing to maturity to evaluate the impact of low radiation on crop growth, photosynthesis and yield. Grain yield losses and leaf area index (LAI) reduction were less than the reduction in solar radiation under both shading treatment in both cultivars. Compared with the control (S0), grain yield only reduced 6.4 % and 9.9 % under 22 % shading treatment (S1), while 16.2 % and 25.8 % under 33 % shading (S2) in Yangmai 158 and Yangmai 11 respectively. The reduction in LAI was 6.0 % and 9.2 % (S1), and 18.2 % and 22.2 % (S2) in Yangmai 158 and Yangmai 11 respectively. However, decline in canopy apparent photosynthetic rate (CAP) was 15.0-22.9 % (S1) and 29.5-49.6 % (S2), which was consistent with the reduction in radiation. The reduction in LAI was partially compensated by increases in the fraction of the top and bottom leaf area to the total leaf area, which facilitated to intercept more solar radiation by the canopy. The decrease in photosynthetic rate (Pn) of flag leaf was partially compensated by the increase in Pn of the third leaf from the top. In addition, an inconsistency between the low Pn and the high Chl content in flag leaf was observed at 30 DAA. This could be explained that more excitation energy was dispersed via the non-photochemical approaches in the photosystem II (PSII) of flag leaf after long-term shading.

The objective was to evaluate biomass production, accumulation and release of macronutrients, and the decomposition of straws of pearl millet (Pennisetum typhoides (Burm.) Stapf) and pearl millet plus Crotalaria juncea intercropping, in field condition, under dry bean, sowed in February (summer/autumn). The experimental design was randomized blocks, with four replications, in a split-plot arrangement, with the straws in the plots and evaluation periods in sub-plots (0, 8, 16, 24, 40, 56 e 72 days after seeding). The collected residues were dried to determine the remaining dry matter, then ground and sent to laboratory in order to determinate macronutrient contents. By the contents and remaining dry matter amounts, the remaining nutrient amounts were determined, expressed as percentages of the initial amounts. Nonlinear models were fit to the values, choosing the best adjustment. The pearl millet plus Crotalaria juncea intercropping provided the largest biomass production. The straw from intercropping accumulated and released the largest macronutrients quantities, except for sulfur. The single millet presented the fastest nitrogen release speed.

To do this, the field experiments were carried out in randomized block design with 3 replications using corn variety P.32K61 and soybean variety OAC Salem in 2001 and 2002 as materials. They were seeded as monocropping and intercropping in alternated rows with the seeding rates of 100% corn + 0% soybean (SRI), 100% corn + 50% soybean (SR2), 100% corn + 100% soybean (SR3),50% corn + 50% soybean (SR4), 50% corn + 100% soybean (SR5) and 0% corn + 100% soybean (SR6). The nutriments components, namely, Dry Matter (DM), Crude Ash (CA), Crude Protein (CP), Crude Fat (CF), Crude Cellulose (CC) and cell wall components, namely Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF), Acid Detergent Fiber (ADF) and Acid Detergent Lignin (ADL) were analyzed Before Ensiling (BE) and After Ensiling (AE) in both years. Hemicelluloses, cellulose and lignin were derived from the cell wall components. To determine the silage quality value, the Flieg points were calculated. The silages made using corn grown intercropped with soybean were good or very good quality in terms of physical characteristics. The soybean grown as mono-crop did not achieve high quality silages. The results substantiated that the mono-cropped corn and corn grown together with soybean at the different seeding rates gave rise to high quality silages. The digestibility of the silages mode from corn and soybean after ensiling was higher than that observed before ensiling.

EFFECT OF INTERCROPPING ON NEMATODES IN TWO SMALL-SCALE SUGARCANE FARMING SYSTEMS IN SOUTH AFRICA	NEMATROPICA			English	Article						"Intercropping; nematodes; small-scale farming; soil fertility; South Africa; sugarcane"	"MELOIDOGYNE-INCOGNITA; MANAGEMENT; CROTALARIA; CROP; ASSOCIATION; NITROGEN; GROWTH; ROOTS; SOIL"	"Two trials were planted on sandy soils on small-scale grower farms to study the effect of intercropping on the nematode fauna, soil and plant fertility and sugarcane yield. Peanut (Arachis hypogaea) and sugar bean (Phaseolus limensis) were intercropped between the sugarcane rows in the first trial; velvet bean (Mucuna deeringiana) and sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) were intercropped in the second trial. These practices were compared to a standard aldicarb (nematicide) treatment and an untreated control. In the first trial (irrigated sugarcane), peanut grew well as an intercrop, however, 70% of the sugar bean died before producing seeds. Intercropping with sugar bean had no effect on initial sugarcane stalk number whereas peanut reduced initial sugarcane stalk number by 30%. In the second trial (non-irrigated sugarcane), both velvet bean and sweet potato grew well as intercrops. Intercropping resulted in initial reduction in sugarcane stalk number of 30% for sweet potato and 70% for velvet bean. However, for both trials, and for all intercrops (except peanut), the sugarcane stalk number at harvest was the same as that of the control. Intercropping with velvet bean, peanut and sweet potato increased Meloidogyne javanica and Pratylenchus zeae infestation of the sugarcane sett roots; conversely, intercropping with sugar bean reduced nematode infestation. Intercropping with velvet bean, sugar bean and sweet potato had no effect on sugarcane yield, whereas intercropping with peanut reduced sugarcane yield by 22% and sucrose yield by 29%. Intercropping with velvet bean increased levels of some nutrients in the soil and leaves of sugarcane. These results show that intercropping can be used by small-scale growers to: manage nematodes (sugar bean), provide nutrients to the sugarcane crop (velvet bean), provide alternative food source and/or income (sweet potatoes) and to improve the overall productivity of the land without being detrimental to sugarcane cultivation."

Potential Benefits of Intercropping Corn with Runner Bean for Small-sized Farming System	ASIAN-AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES			English	Article						"Intercropping; Runner Bean; Corn; Silage; Digestibility; LER Value"	"FORAGE; BARLEY; TRITICALE; MIXTURES; QUALITY; GROWTH; YIELD; OAT"	The objectives of this study were to evaluate potential benefits of intercropping of corn with runner bean for a small-sized farming system.. based on land equivalent ratio (LER) and silage yield and quality of corn intercropped with runner bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), in and conditions of Turkey under an irrigation system. This experiment was established as a split-plot design in a randomized complete block, with three replications and carried out over two (consecutive) years in 2006 and 2007. Seven different mixtures (runner bean, B and silage corn sole crop, C., 10% B+90% C, 20% B+80% C, 30% B+70% C, 40% B+60%C, and 50% B+50%C) of silage corn-runner bean were intercropped. All of the mixtures were grown under irrigation. The corn-runner bean fields were planted in the second week of May and harvested in the first week of September in both years. Green beans were harvested three times each year and green bean yields were recorded each time. After the 3rd harvest of green bean, residues of bean and corn together were randomly harvested from a 1 m(2) area by hand using a clipper when the bean started to dry and corn was at the dough stage. Green mass yields of each plot were recorded. Silages were prepared from each plot (triplicate) in 1 L mini-silos. After 60 d ensiling, sub-samples were taken from this material for determination of dry matter (DM), pH. organic acids, chemical composition, and in vitro DM digestibility of silages. The LER index was also calculated to evaluate intercrop efficiencies with respect to sole crops. Average pH, acetic, propionic and butyric acid concentrations were similar but lactic acid and ammonia-N levels were significantly different (p<0.05) among different mixtures of bean intercropped with corn. Ammonia-N levels linearly increased from 0.90% to 2.218 as the percentage of bean increased in the mixtures up to a 50:50 seeding ratio. While average CP content increased linearly from 6.47 to 12.45%, and average NDF and ADF contents decreased linearly from 56.17 to 44.88 and from 34.92 to 33.51%. respectively, (p<0.05) as the percentage of bean increased in the mixtures up to a 50:50 seeding ratio, but DM and OM contents did not differ among different mixtures of bean intercropped with corn (p>0.05). In vitro OM digestibility values differed significantly among bean-corn mixture silages (p<0.05). Fresh bean. herbage DM, IVOMD, ME yields, and LER index were significantly influenced by percentage of bean in the mixtures (p<0.01). As the percentage of bean increased in the mixtures up to a 50:50 seeding ratio, yields of fresh bean (from 0 to 24,380 kg/ha) and CP (from 1,258.0 to 1,563.0 kg/ha) and LER values (from 1.0 to 1.775) linearly increased, but yields of herbage DM (from 19,670 to 12,550 kg/ha), IVOMD (from 12.790 to 8.020 kg/ha) and ME (46,230 to 29,000 Mcal/ha) yields decreased (p<0.05). In conclusion, all of the bean-corn mixtures provided a good silage and better CP concentrations. Even though forage yields decreased, the LER index linearly increased as the percentage of bean increased in the mixture up to a 50:50 seeding ratio, which indicates a greater utilization of land. Therefore. a 50:50 seeding ratio seemed to be best for optimal utilization of land in this study and to provide greater financial stability for labor-intensive, small farmers.	"[Karsli, M.

Two cover crops, buckwheat (BW), Fagopyrum esculentum Moench, and white clover (WC), Trifolium repens L., or sunn hemp (SH), Crotolaria juncea L., and an intercropped vegetable, okra, Abelmonchus esculentus L., were evaluated during the 2003,2005, and 2006 growing seasons, respectively. Population densities of whiteflies and SSL severity varied during the three field experiments. In 2003, the severity of SSL and percentage of leaves displaying symptoms were significantly lower on zucchini plants in WC than BW plots throughout the crops' growth cycle. Additionally, the percentage of leaves per plant displaying SSL symptoms was significantly greater in bare-ground (BG) compared with the pooled BW and WC treatments on each inspection date. In 2005, zucchini intercropped with okra had lower numbers of adult whiteflies mid resulted in significantly lower severity of SSL than pooled BW and WC treatments. During 2006, zucchini grown with SH had significantly lower numbers of all whitefly stages (i.e., egg, immature, and adult) and less SSL severity symptoms than BW. Despite these differences in whitefly numbers and SSL severity, marketable yields were not significantly lower in BW compared with WC or SH treatment plots dining the study, The mechanisms underlying these results and the feasibility of using cover crops and intercrops to manage B. argentifolli and SSL are discussed.

The budgeting of water showed that there was no deficit of soil moisture until 37 standard week during two years study. Long duration crop of cotton intercropped with early maturing cowpea, greengram or blackgram significantly enhanced seed cotton equivalent yield over sole cotton. The rainfall in the later period was short of actual evapotranspiration. Therefore intercrops of longer duration viz., sesamum maturing in 75 days, soybean in 91 days and groundnut in 105 days were highly competitive and did not increase the seed cotton yield equivalents over the sole crop.

These abiotic factors (light, humidity and habitat structure) affect the selection of oviposition sites and egg survival of carabid beetles. In a Field experiment, more larvae of Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger) (Coleoptera Carabidae) were caught in Brussels sprout intercropped with barley than in Brussels sprout alone. The influence of the presence of living barley and Brussels sprout plants on oviposition was Studied in the laboratory. Also, the effects of wet/dry substrate, light/shadowed and structured/unstructured environment on the number of eggs laid were investigated under laboratory conditions. Results indicate a preference for moist, shadowed, structurally complex environments as egg laying sites. This preference results in significantly higher numbers of eggs laid by beetles in barley compared to Brussels sprout. Vegetation characteristics by themselves may influence egg-laying-site preferences, in addition to the availability of prey for adults and larvae in the different cropping systems. Vegetables intercropped with cereals provide a more favourable microclimate for the reproduction of P. melanarius than vegetables grown alone.

One strategy to improve yields is to choose crops with high nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) that can produce economic yields under limited water supply. Little information is available on the comparative performance of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L. R. Br.) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) in sole crops and intercrops systems for the NUE of applied fertilizers. This study was conducted under field conditions at the Senegal Agricultural Research Institute from July to October 2001. Two cropping systems were used and included sole crops of pearl millet and cowpea and a millet-cowpea intercrop. N-15-labeled urea at rates of 20 kg ha(-1) (sole and intercrop cowpea) and 41 kg ha(-1) (sole millet and intercrop millet) was applied. Sole millet produced 6,041 kg yield ha(-1) and accumulated 95.27 kg N ha(-1), of which 15.30% was derived from the nitrogen fertilizer and 84.70% from nitrogen mineralized in soil. Therefore, the NUE of the fertilizer was 36.29%. In intercrop millet, sole cowpea and intercrop cowpea, the NUEs were 15.20, 45.33 and 46.00%, respectively, indicating that the use of nitrogen fertilizer significantly decreased in intercrop only for millet. However, no significant difference was observed between sole and intercrop cowpea relative to the nitrogen derived from N-2 fixation. The amount of nitrogen immobilized in the soil was significantly higher in sole millet than in sole cowpea and millet-cowpea intercrop. The Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) of grains and total dry matter showed an advantage of the millet-cowpea cropping system over sole crops.

J	"Singh, AK; Lal, M"				"Singh, A. K.; Lal, Menhi"			Weed management in spring planted sugarcane (Saccharum spp hybrid)-based intercropping systems	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						"weed; spring sugarcane; intercropping; weed control efficiency"		A field experiment was conducted during spring 2000-01 and 2001-02 at the research farm of the Institute, Lucknow on sandy loam soil to evaluate the efficacy of weed control methods in sugarcane (Saccharum spp hybrid) based intercropping systems. Sugarcane + cowpea (Vigna unguicuata L. Walp), effectively suppressed the weed density (81/m(2)) and reduced the dry weight of weeds significantly (10.1 g/m(2)) over the sole sugarcane during early growth stages (60 days after planting). Next in order were sugarcane + greengram. [Vigna radiata (L.) R. Wilczek] and sugarcane + blackgram [Vigna mungo (L.) Hepper]. After the harvest of intercrops, at peak tillering stage of sugarcane (90 and 120 days after planting), the weed population was at par under different intercropping systems. Weed dry matter accumulation also followed the same trend. The corresponding weed control efficiency worked out to be 40.6, 37.0 and 39.7% respectively. Plots receiving manual hoeing at 20, 40 and 60 days after planting resulted in minimum weed density (58.3/m(2)) as well as weed dry matter (15.1 g/m(2)) and thus proved highly effective. The highest weed control efficiency at 60, 90 and 120 days after planting worked out to be 42.6, 58.5 and 67.8% respectively under this treatment. Plots under sugarcane + greengram intercropping system recorded maximum number of millable caries (89.3 thousand/ha), cane length (184.1/ cm), cane yield (72.7 tonnes/ha), cane equivalent yield (86.6 tonnes/ha) and sugar yield - commercial cane sugar (8 4 tonnes/ha). This intercropping system was closely followed by sugarcane + cowpea (for green pods) with cane equivalent yield of 83.3 tonnes/ha. Weed free conditions gave highest number of millable canes (95.5 thousand/ha), cane length (183.2 cm), cane diameter (2.70 cm), weight of individual cane (0.93 kg) and ultimately the cane yield (76.2 tonnes/ha) as well as cane equivalent yield (85.8 tonnesi/ha). Other weed control methods were found equally effective among them, but proved quite effective over weedy check (CEY, 59.9 tonnes/ha). Weed free conditions also recorded higher brix (20.50%), pol% juice (18.1), purity coefficient (89.3%), commercial cane sugar (11.8%) and sugar yield (9.0 tonnes/ha). Sugarcane + greengram intercropping system applied with pendimethalin fetched highest profit (Rs 52 480/ha) and B: C ratio (2.53).	"[Singh, A.

The recommended population density for carrot in sole crop is 500 thousand plants per hectare and for lettuce in sole crop is 250 thousand plants per hectare. Both bivariate method of variance and data envelopment analysis are quite effective in discriminating the best intercropping systems as assessed through component crop yields. The results of the yield efficiency as assessed by PEA models allow a simple statistical analysis of the intercropping experiment.

Results revealed that all three intercrops were effective in inhibiting purple nutsedge density (70-96%) and dry matter production (71-97%) during both years of experimentation. Control in the second year was more effective than in the first year. The seed cotton yield was also depressed by the intercrops but its suppression (8-23%) was far less severe than that of purple nutsedge and its loss was compensated by greater total economic returns. Intercropping of sorghum and sesame produced greater than 20% net benefits (up to 60%) in comparison with the control (cotton alone). Soybean intercropping produced comparable net benefits (95-103%). Sesame two rows intercrop treatment appeared the most profitable with net benefit of 51-59% with good purple nutsedge control (73-92% density suppression, 77-95% dry weight suppression) during both years of experimentation.

Seasonal soil water variation and root patterns between two semi-arid shrubs co-existing with Pearl millet in Senegal, West Africa	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						"vadose zone hydrology; plant-water relations; semi-arid agro-ecosystems; soil moisture; intercropping"	"HYDRAULIC LIFT; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; COMPETITION; DISTRIBUTIONS; CONSEQUENCES; PHOSPHORUS; TRANSPORT; SORGHUM; CANOPY; FIELDS"	Soil water is an important resource that imposes limitations on optimal plant performance in semi-arid regions. In some of these regions, shrubs form a characteristic component of farmers' fields and potentially impact crop productivity. Consequently, a 2-year study on soil water dynamics and shrub rooting patterns was conducted during the dry season and transition into the wet season with fields having Pearl millet intercropped with shrubs. Millet roots predominantly exploited the 0.2-0.5 m depth range with 95% of shrub roots in the upper 0.5m. Soil volumetric water content (soil water content) decreased with greater radial distance from shrubs up to 2 m but progressively increased with soil depth. During the dry season, soil surrounding shrub roots was consistently moister than adjacent bare soil albeit at depth, soil moisture content declined steadly in the 0.9-1.2 m depth range due to depletion by shrub roots. On the contrary, the 0.2 and 0.4 m zones depicted slight increments in soil moisture which could be attributed to soil water redistribution by shrub roots. During the rainy season, shrub presence had a considerable impact on the fate of the field soil moisture regime with shrub roots serving as pathways for deep profile recharge. Shrubs exploited the deeper profile (0.9-1.2 m) as opposed to the Pearl millet (0.2-0.5 m) suggesting that intercropping of annual crops with shrub stands could serve as an innovative and viable agronomic option in these vulnerable Sahel agro-ecosystmes.

The agronomic effects of annual plant diversity from mixtures of crop species and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivar types were compared using richness levels of 1, 2, 5 or 10 randomly selected taxa in a greenhouse experiment. Increasing crop richness increased overall crop dry matter production, production stability (i.e., decreased CV for dry matter production) and weed suppression. These agronomic variables tended to level off after a richness of five to six crop species, suggesting that further increases in crop diversity are redundant. Increasing barley cultivar richness increased crop production in one of two experimental runs, but no effects were observed for weed suppression. Increased light interception related to greater plant canopy height variation in diverse mixtures of species could have contributed to increased productivity in the crop richness experiment. The results of this study suggest that the ecological functions of diversity provide productivity, yield stability and weed suppression benefits for mixtures of crop species, and even perhaps for mixtures of cultivars within a given crop species.

Ten species were planted in 1.2 ha, in a way that each row had two species in alternate and divergent position in relation to the lateral lines, so that each plant of one species was surrounded by plants of different species. After 15 months banana, papaya, and guava species were replaced by cupuacu, peach palm, and avocado, respectively. Banana was bad adapted to the system and this could be caused by the harmful effects of wind and higher irradiation due large plant spacing utilized in relation to the commercial plantation. Mango, sapodilla, cashew tree, acerola, and soursop tree adapted well to the system. During the 34 month-period of evaluation the regrowth of the natural flora between rows has been impaired by the low soil fertility and organic matter which may also have favored pests and diseases attack.

More P. xylostella adults were caught in the monoculture than in the intercrop. Numbers of R xylostella larvae and pupae per sprout plant were lower in intercropped plots than in monocultures. However, more larvae and pupae were found per m(2) leaf area in the inter- than in the monocrop. Both the densities per plant and per m(2) leaf area of B. brassicae populations were lower in the inter- than in the monocrop. After the barley withered and competition with Brussels sprout abated, aphid densities became higher in the inter- than in the monocrop. These findings may be explained by interspecific plant competition resulting in stressed sprout plants with a smaller size and delayed phenology relative to monocropped plants. Effects of differences in plant nutritional quality on herbivore performance were studied by offering leaves of inter- and monocropped sprout plants to larval R brassicae. Performance and food utilisation were significantly better on leaves from the intercrop, (lower dry weight consumption, higher growth rates) than from the monocrop. Defoliation rate was also higher on leaves of intercropped plants than on monocropped ones. The studies indicate that plant stress and consequent changes in developmental rate and nutritional quality of plants are playing a role in herbivore population responses to intercropping. It is argued that such confounding effects of plant competition in intercropping designs can hamper the evaluation of herbivore responses in pest-suppressive agro-ecosystems. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Merr.] has long been used as a forage crop but its morphological development and forage potential have not been studied extensively. A study was conducted using oilseed soybean cultivars of different maturity to determine their morphological development, forage yield, seed components and seed yield at the University of Ankara, Turkey. Five soybean cultivars OAC Salem (earliest), OAC Bayfield (mid-early), OAC Eclipse (mid-early but later than OAC Bayfield), OAC Glencoe (full-season soybean) and SA.88 (late), we. re used in the study conducted in 2000 and 2001. The full-season cultivar OAC Glencoe was the tallest cultivar, and had the highest levels of fresh and dry matter yield and crude protein yield among soybean cultivars in both years. Therefore, OAC Glencoe is considered to be the most, suitable soybean cultivar for forage production when intercropped with corn in Ankara region of Turkey. However,. attention should be given to the earliest maturing cultivar OAC Salem that had the highest seed yield and better relative seed composition of all the cultivars.

Six variants of organic amendment were examined: 1 - straw harvest, 2 - straw harvest + green manuring, 3 - straw incorporation, 4 - straw incorporation + green manuring, 5 - straw burning, 6 - straw burning till 1977 + intercrop, incorporation of farmyard manure at 10 t/ha since 1978. The effect of organic amendment on winter wheat continuous cropping was statistically significant. On average of the whole period (32 years), the highest yields were produced in variants with straw burning (var. 5) - 6.04 t/ha and with green manuring (var. 2) - 6.03 t/ha, and lower yields in variants with straw incorporation into soil (var. 3) - 5.65 t/ha, (var. 4) - 5.67 t/ha. The smallest differences between variants were found in the first decade of the experiment. Over time (in the second and third decades), the differences increased and positive effects of green manuring and straw burning and adverse effects of straw incorporation into soil increased. The yield level of winter wheat continuous cropping was high under the given conditions. The yield for the whole period of the experiment averaged 5.85 t/ha, the yields 5.19, 6.54 and 5.76 t/ha were obtained in the first, second and third decade, respectively.

The objective of this work was to study the dynamics of litter decomposition of Arachis pintoi (pinto peanut), Hyparrhenia rufa (thatching grass) and a mixture of both species in a lowland soil. These treatments were analyzed in three areas: grass monoculture, legume monoculture and legume intercropped with the grass during the dry and wet seasons. Litter bags containing the legume, grass ora mixture of both species were incubated to estimate the decomposition rate and microorganism colonization. Decomposition constants(K) and litter half-lives (T-1/2) were estimated by an exponential model whereas number of microorganisms in specific media were determined by plate dilution. The decomposition rate, release of nutrients and microorganisms number, especially bacteria, increased when pinto peanut was added to thatching grass, influenced by favorable lignin/N and C/N ratios in legume litter. When pinto peanut litter was incubated in the grass plots, 50% N and P was released within about 135 days in the dry season and in the wet season, the equivalent release occurred within 20 days. These results indicate that A. pintoi has a great potential for nutrient recycling via litter and can be used to recover degraded areas.

Fiori & Paol.)-based intercroppings, viz wheat + indian mustard [Brassica juncea (L.) Czernj. & Cosson] and wheat + gram (Cicer arietinum L.) to varying moisture regimes (IW: CPE 0.4 and 0.8) and irrigation water salinity levels (0.4, 6 and 12 dS/m). Growth and yield (4.489 tonnes/ha) of wheat crop increased with increasing frequency of irrigation water when its salt level was EC 6 dS/m. However, decreasing trend in growth and yield was observed with further increasing the salinity (EC 12 dS/m) of irrigation water. Growth and yield (0.018 tonnes/ha) of gram decreased significantly with increasing frequency and salinity of irrigation water. However, yield ( 0.873 tonne/ha) of indian mustard increased significantly with the increase in irrigation frequency even with saline water of EC 12 dS/m. Indian mustard was found most tolerant to both salt and moisture stress, while gram was very sensitive to salt stress. Water-use efficiency increased at both salinity levels but the increase was greater (9.92 %) at lower salinity level. The water-use efficiency decreased with increasing moisture regimes. it was lowest (121.06 kg/ha/cm) in wheat + Indian mustard intercropping.

Leaf area profiles on main shoots and tillers	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						"pearl millet; tillering; leaf area profiles; leaf size; simulation model"	"GRAIN-SORGHUM; BALANCES; LEAVES; AFRICA"	Pearl millet (Pennisteum americanum L.) is an essential crop in farming systems of the dry areas of the semi-arid tropics and its tillering habit is an important adaptive feature. This is the first paper in a series aiming at developing and validating a pearl millet simulation model that recognises tillers as functional entities, analogous to intercrops. The objective of this paper is to quantify the effects of total leaf number per axis (TLN), cultivar, plant density and axis number on parameters that are used to simulate potential leaf area per plant. Four cultivars with different phenology and tillering habit were grown under well-watered and well-fertilised conditions at two locations in India, covering a range of daylengths and plant densities. For selected plants, the area of fully expanded leaves was measured non-destructively. A bell-shaped function adequately described the relationship between individual leaf area and leaf position on an axis. Its shape was determined by the position (X-0) and area (Y-0) of the largest leaf and by the breadth and skewness of the leaf area profile curve. TLN affected all four parameters, although the association with Y-0 was weak. Cultivar only affected Y-0, suggesting that parameterising new cultivars is straightforward. The observed density effect confirmed that competition for light between axes started during stem elongation. The results highlighted the consistent differences between leaf area profiles of main shoots and tillers. For a high-tillering crop like pearl millet, modelling leaf area dynamics through individual leaves is justified, as this approach can potentially deal with cultivar and environmental effects on tillering.

Populations were estimated by soil sorting monthly in the first two cropping cycles and bimonthly in the third cycle. Earthworm population dynamics were strongly related to changes in soil moisture, with low population levels coinciding with low moisture content. Populations in conventional wheat were generally quite stable but showed a sharp drop after autumn ploughing followed by a marked recovery in the first two cropping cycles. In wheat-clover, drought conditions during the first summer probably disrupted population build-up. Population levels in the two systems diverged in the second cropping cycle and were widely separated in the third cycle when 319 individuals m(-2) (55 g biomass m(-2)) were found in conventional wheat and 1160 individuals m(-2) (175 g biomass m(-2)) in wheat-clover. Nine earthworm species were present in both cropping systems and shifts in species composition were relatively small. Murchieona minuscula, a little known endogeic species previously unreported from Ireland, was abundant in both systems and appeared to benefit from annual ploughing. Earthworm tissue production was estimated to be 81-209 g m(-2) in conventional wheat and 122-552 g m(-2) in wheat-clover, while N output resulting from mortality was calculated at 0.75-4.24 g m(-2) in wheat and 1.16-10.61 g m(-2) in wheat-clover N output via excretion and mucus was estimated to account for a further 2.93-3.65 g m(-2) in the wheat and 4.98-10.69 g m(-2) in the wheat-clover crop.

Voluntary intake and nutrient digestibility	ANNALES DE ZOOTECHNIE			English	Article						"forage quality; vetch-oat hay; digestibility; sheep; Mediterranean agriculture"	FORAGE	Forage hay from the common vetch-oat intercrop has the potential to meet the forage deficit and integrate crop and livestock production in Mediterranean cereal-sheep systems. Groups of three wethers (1-2 year-old) were randomly allocated to individual on-farm hays of a sample size of 12 with the aim of assessing variability of botanical and chemical fractions, digestibility of nutrients, and DM intake. Vetch content (g.kg(-1) DM) of hays (mean value = 557) ranged from 125 to 917. Mean contents (g.kg(-1) DM) of crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent lignin (ADL) were 126, 486, and 45 respectively. Variations of chemical composition between bays, and especially those of CP and ADL were partially explained by vetch proportion. Voluntary intake (g DM.kg(-1).BW0.75) had a mean value of 64.2 and ranged from 49.0 to 78.9. Organic matter digestibility (mean value = 68.8%) ranged from 59.9 to 72.6%. The digestibility coefficient of nutrients and voluntary intake showed lower variability than that of chemical fractions, which, in turn, had a lower variability than that of botanical composition. The mean digestible energy (DE) concentration of the study sample was 11.72 MJ DE.kg(-1) DM. Low variability of this value (CV = 5.9%) indicated a compensatory effect between vetch and oat. Vetch proportion in hay gave a better explanation of the variation of CP intake (r(2) = 0.63) than of the variation of DE intake (r(2) = 0.37). On-farm hays with at least 50% of vetch contribution may be considered as a production objective. This criterion may contribute to standardisation and marketing operations at the farm level.

Toria) with pea (Pisum sativum), with lentil (Lens culinaris) and with gram (Cicer areitinum L.). Intercropping systems were assessed on the basis of new indices termed 'actual yield loss' (AYL) and 'intercropping advantage' (IA), as well as several existing intercropping indices such as LER, RCC and aggressivity. Intercropping reduced the yield of component crops, compared with respective pure stands. Mustard + pea in 1:1 row-replacement series gave the highest mustard yield equivalent value(1.00 t/ha). When the actual sown proportion was considered, mustard+lentil (1:1) resulted in maximum AYL (+0.438) and IA (+2.889) values. We conclude that AYL and IA are more appropriate, particularly when per plant yield is considered.

Lam] were grown in monocultured or intercropped recirculating hydroponic systems in a greenhouse using the nutrient film technique (NFT), The objective was to determine whether growth and subsequent yield would be affected by intercropping. Treatments were sweetpotato monoculture (SP), peanut monoculture (PN), and sweetpotato and peanut grown in separate NFT channels but sharing a common nutrient solution (SP-PN), Greenhouse conditions ranged from 24 to 33 degrees C, 60% to 90% relative humidity (RH), and photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) of 200 to 1700 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). Sweetpotato cuttings (15 cm long) and 14-day-old seedlings of peanuts were planted into growth channels (0.15 x 0.15 x 1.2 m), Plants were spaced 25 cm apart within and 25 cm apart between growing channels. A modified half-Hoagland solution with al N : 2.4 K ratio was used. Solution pH was maintained between 5.5 and 6.0 for treatments involving SP and 6.4 and 6.7 for PN, Electrical conductivity (EC) ranged between 1100 and 1200 mu S.cm(-1). The number of storage roots per sweetpotato plant was similar for both SP and SP-PN, Storage soot fresh and dry mass were 29% and 36% greater, respectively, for plants in the SP-PN treatment than for plants in the SP treatment. The percent dry mass of the storage roots, dry mass of fibrous and pencil roots, and the length-to-diameter ratio of storage roots were similar for SP and SP-PN sweetpotato plants. Likewise, foliage fresh and dry mass and harvest index were not significantly influenced by treatment. Total dry mass was 37% greater for PN than for SP-PN peanut plants,and pod dry mass was 82% higher, Mature and total seed dry mass and fibrous root dry mass were significantly greater for PN than for SP-PN plants. Harvest index (HI) was similar for both treatments. Root length tended to be lower for seedlings grown in the nutrient solution from the SP-PN treatment.

Our objectives were to determine: 1) if intercropped pea would reduce chile yield and vice versa; 2) the effects of pea planting rates and dates on pea yield, Intercropped peas reduced chile yield by about 22% in 1995, but had no significant effects in other years. Pea plants from the August intercrops reached the flowering stage but did not produce pods in 1995 or 1996; some small pods were produced from August intercrops in 1997. Final plant densities were lower and less uniform in 1996 than in 1995 or 1997, Intercropped peas yielded less than monocropped peas in all years. Pea yields ranged from 1370 to 3960 kg.ha(-1) when monocropped, 31 kg.ha(-1) (1996 single-row) to 646 kg.ha(-1) (1995 double-row) when intercropped. In 1995 only, the double-row intercrop yielded more peas than the single-row intercrop, Pod yield/plant was reduced 80%, 98%, and 96% in 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively, by intercropping.

All species mixtures were grown with and without a total of 200 kg ha(-1) of N to compare N-2 fixation by Persian clover with N fertilizer. Averaged over 2 yr, adding Persian clover to barley-ryegrass provided a total yield that was 96% of that obtained by adding fertilizer N to barley-ryegrass. Second cut yield averaged 58% more with clover than with N. However, the grasses yielded more than the grasses with added clover in the third cut. Adding clover to ryegrass provided 94% of the total yield of adding N fertilizer. Persian clover was higher in crude protein and in vitro digestibility of dry matter than ryegrass, so adding clover tended to improve the nutritive value of mixtures. This was most obvious without N, where Persian clover accounted for more of the total forage produced.

All two-crop combinations of mustard, oat, and bean were examined in comparison with their sole crops. In the absence of failure, only the oat-bean combination gave an advantage over sole cropping (LER = 1.39). For all combinations, if failure of either component occurred at the early or medium stages of growth, or if the less competitive component failed late, the surviving component compensated and intercropping was higher yielding than sole cropping. However, if the more competitive component failed late, the suppressed surviving component was unable to compensate sufficiently and sole cropping was higher yielding. Compensation was dependent on the nature of the surviving component but was not simply a reflection of its competitive ability in the absence of failure.

Among the different cropping systems berseem sole crop gave the highest yield of green and dry forage and economic return. A combination of oat (Avena sativa L.) either with berseem or lucerne in 2:2 or 4:4 row arrangements respectively gave more green-fodder yield than oat alone. Berseem in sole and intercropping systems produced more nodules/plant than lucerne. The nodule number started decreasing after second cut (80 days after sowing) both in berseem and lucerne.

Thirty-five bird species were observed using the strips, with brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) and vesper sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus) most abundant. Feeding was the most common behavior, and corn and soybean strips were used most by birds. Four species of birds nested in the strip intercropping system, although only vesper sparrows nested in 1992. One vesper sparrow nest successfully fledged young. The 40 remaining nests were lost because of desertion (5% of all nests) or destruction by farm implements (39%), predators (29%), brood parasitism (12%), weather (5%), or observer (3%). Corn and soybean strips were preferred for nesting by birds. Bird abundance was higher in the strip intercropping system than in conventional row crop fields, suggesting better foraging habitat in the strips. This system, however, may function as an ecological. trap for birds by attracting them to nest in an area with high risk of nest failure.

All the grain legumes significantly depressed the coffee yields during the third year after field planting. Yield depression of coffee due to intercropping was 31, 29, 39, 50 and 30% by dry beans, green peas, green grams, cowpeas and chick peas respectively compared to the non-inter-cropped coffee. However, all the grain legumes generated monetary economic benefits during the period when coffee produced low monetary returns. The benefits from grain legumes compensated for the loss of income from coffee due to the initial depression of coffee yields except when intercropped with green grams. The highest monetary net economic benefits were obtained from green peas followed by chick peas, cowpeas, dry beans and green grams in that order. There was therefore, ensured early returns from coffee investment.

The severity of Cylindrosporium leaf spot was not influenced by the intercropping practices, while that of tar spot was reduced in the intercrops especially at high plant density. Pyricularia leaf spot was more severe in mixtures of finger millet with the legumes, but was reduced in the sorghum intercrop. Both leaf blast and leaf spot diseases tended to be more severe with increase in plant population, particularly when finger millet was grown in pure stand. Grain yield advantages were achieved mainly in mixtures of finger millet with pigeon peas, and this was attributed to differences in growth cycles and reduced competition for nitrogen rather than to more effective control of diseases.

(BV-BV), or double cropped with annual ryegrass included with the second crop (B-BR). Averaged over 2 yr, BR produced 19% more dry matter, 38% more in vitro digestible dry matter and 43% more crude protein than B-B. Intercropped common vetch (BV-BV) improved forage quality and increased protein yield of both barley crops without reducing seasonal dry matter yield. Intercropping annual ryegrass reduced the neutral detergent fiber of both barley crops, but did not affect other quality characteristics or yield.

Some of the most common herbivores and natural enemies were sampled by direct counts and damage estimation from 1988 through 1990 on monoculture corn and strips of corn alternated with soybean, under no-tillage and conventional tillage. Among soil pests, cutworms (mostly the black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel)); armyworm, Pseudaletia unipuncta (Haworth); and slugs (Gastropoda) were more abundant in no-tillage plots, although only slugs caused severe damage. The western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, and the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), were generally more abundant in conventional tillage plots. Despite crop rotation, the strip-intercropping system (four rows of each crop) was less effective in reducing western corn rootworm infestation, especially in conventional tillage plots. In 1990 only, ladybugs (mostly Coleomegilla maculata (DeGeer)) were more abundant in conventional tillage plots, whereas tarnished plant bugs, Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois), were more abundant in no-tillage plots.

However, our understanding of N2O emission during this season is poor due to a scarcity of available field N2O measurements. Using the static manual chamber-GC technique, seasonal N2O emissions during the non-rice growing season were simultaneously measured at two adjacent rice-wheat and rice-rapeseed fields in southwest China for three consecutive annual rotation cycles (May 2005 to May 2008). Compared to the control, N fertilizer applications significantly enhanced soil N2O emissions from both wheat and rapeseed systems. Seasonal cumulative N2O fluxes from wheat systems were on average 2.6 kg N ha(-1) for the recommended practice (RP [150 kg N ha(-1)]) and 5.0 kg N ha(-1) for the conventional practice (CP [250 kg N ha(-1)]). Lower N2O emissions were observed from the adjacent rapeseed systems. Average cumulative seasonal N2O fluxes from rapeseed were 1.5 and 2.2 kg N ha(-1) for the RP and CP treatments, respectively. The first 3 weeks after N fertilization were the hot moment of N2O emissions for both the wheat and rapeseed systems. The lowest yield-scaled N2O fluxes for wheat were obtained at the RP treatment (mean: 0.81 kg N Mg-1) while for rapeseed the CP treatment produced the lowest yield-scaled fluxes (mean: 0.79 kg N Mg-1). On average, the direct N2O emission factors (EFd) for the wheat system (1.76 %) were over two times higher than for the rapeseed system (0.73 %). Intercropping of rapeseed tends to result in lower N2O emissions than wheat for rice-upland crop rotation systems of southwest China, indicating that either the N fertilization or the cropping system need to be considered not only for improving the estimate of regional and/or national N2O fluxes but also for proposing the climate-smart agricultural management practice to reduce N2O emissions from agricultural soils.

A field experiment was conducted in Northwestern Ethiopia on nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and land use efficiency in finger millet and common bean cropping systems. Factorial combinations of three cropping systems (monoculture finger millet, monoculture common bean and their intercropping) and five fertilizer levels (0, 50%, 100%, 150% and 200% of the recommended N and P fertilizer rate of each monoculture crop) were laid out in randomized complete block design with three replications. Results revealed that in both cropping systems, finger millet grain yield was increased in line with fertilizer levels of which maximum grain yield was obtained in an intercropping with the application of 200% N and P2O5. Application of 100% P2O5 in monoculture common bean gave maximum seed yield, while in an intercropping, application of P2O5 had no significant effect. The highest N and P partial factor productivity and agronomic efficiency of the component crops were recorded in an intercropping with the application of 50% P2O5 and N. Among the cropping systems finger millet-common bean intercropping at 50% P2O5 and N saved 0.91 ha of land over monocultures. In conclusion, intercropping finger millet and common bean at 2:1 ratio with the application of 50% of their blanket recommended N and P2O5 improved the N and P use efficiency thereby increasing the land use efficiency compared to the component monoculture.

These experiments were conducted on a farm during 2016 and 2017 in Iran. Intercrops caused a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in the number of TLM eggs, larvae and galleries and promoted a marked increase in the values of Shannon diversity index (H') for the species composition of TLM predators. Orius niger (Wolff) and Nesidiocoris tenuis (Reuter) were the dominant TLM predators recorded. Moreover, larval parasitoids Bracon hebetor Say and Neochrysocharis formosus (Westwood) were found to be more abundant relative to the other parasitoids in both 2016 and 2017. The larval parasitism rate was higher in intercrops than in tomato monoculture. On the other hand, the land equivalent ratio (LER) in intercrops was greater than one specifically, in 1T:2S (1.22 in 2016 and 1.17 in 2017) and 2T:2S (1.22 in 2016 and 1.19 in 2017). These findings demonstrated that intercropping tomato with sainfoin particularly, in 1T: 2S and 2T: 2S row ratios were effective in controlling T. absoluta in tomato fields.

However, concerns arise from nitrogen (N) uptake by the intercropping crop causing reduction in the yield of the corn. Our objective was to evaluate N recovery efficiency (NRE), and the N dynamics in the soil-plant system in corn intercropped with palisade grass. A field trial was carried out in Bahia, Brazil, evaluating two cropping systems: corn (monoculture) and corn intercropped with palisade grass sowed between rows on the same day as the corn crop, with four replicates in a completely randomized block design. Nitrogen (150 kg.ha(-1)of N-15-urea) was applied at sowing to determine NRE, which means the amounts of N-fertilizer uptake in corn and palisade grass, the amounts of N-fertilizer in soil and the N-15-fertilizer balance. Neither the NRE (63.3% in monoculture and 57.2% in intercropping) nor corn grain yield (9,800 kg.ha(-1) in monoculture and 9,671 kg.ha(-1) in intercropping) was affected by intercropping, which accumulated only 2.1 kg.ha(-1) of N-fertilizer or 1.4% N rate. In addition, palisade grass yielded 2,265 kg.ha(-1) of dry matter. The balance indicated that 82.4% of N-fertilizer was recovered in the monoculture and 86.9% in the intercropping. Intercropping palisadegrass does not affect grain yield or N corn nutrition and has the potential to increase straw production contributing to maintenance of no-till.

Intercropping has many attributes that make it attractive for developing a more sustainable agriculture, such as high yield, high resource use efficiency, lower input requirements, natural suppression of pests, pathogens and weeds, and building a soil with more organic carbon and nitrogen. Information is needed which species combinations perform best under different circumstances and which management is suitable to bring out the best from intercropping in a given production situation. The literature is replete with case studies on intercropping from across the globe, but evidence synthesis is needed to make this information accessible. Meta-analysis requires a careful choice of metric that is appropriate for answering the question at hand, and which lends itself for a robust meta-analysis. This paper reviews some metrics that may be used in the quantitative synthesis of literature data on intercropping.

Fitness trade-offs in pest management and intercropping with colour: an evolutionary framework and potential application	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS			English	Article						"agriculture; camouflage; evolutionary adaptation; fitness trade-offs; gene flow; integrated pest management; intercropping; refuge strategy"	"FRUGIPERDA LEPIDOPTERA-NOCTUIDAE; INSECT RESISTANCE; BT CROPS; ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE; CORN-ROOTWORM; HERBIVORY; ADAPTATION; LEAVES; MAIZE; COSTS"	An important modern goal of plant science research is to develop tools for agriculturalists effective at curbing yield losses to insect herbivores, but resistance evolution continuously threatens the efficacy of pest management strategies. The high-dose/refuge strategy has been employed with some success to curb pest adaptation, and has been shown to be most effective when fitness costs (fitness trade-offs) of resistance are high. Here, I use eco-evolutionary reasoning to demonstrate the general importance of fitness trade-offs for pest control, showing that strong fitness trade-offs mitigate the threat of pest adaptation, even if adaptation were to occur. I argue that novel pest management strategies evoking strong fitness trade-offs are the most likely to persist in the face of unbridled pest adaptation, and offer the manipulation of crop colours as a worked example of one potentially effective strategy against insect herbivores.

For the productive characteristics of the different intercrops, we adopted a randomized block design, for evaluation of the combination of intercropping and conservation technic we used 5 x 2 factorial scheme (five intercrops and two types of conservation techniques). The treatments were Tamani grass as monoculture, and the intercrops of Tamani grass with crotalaria, soybean, cowpea, or pigeon pea. The conservation techniques were haylage (520 g/kg of DM) and hay (870 g/kg of DM). Plants were sown in alternate rows, with 45 cm of spacing between the rows. The parameters evaluated were grass and legume biomass production, canopy height, and haylage and hay chemical composition, and in vitro dry matter digestibility (ivDMD). There were no differences in the total biomass production between the intercrops and TA grass monoculture. The treatments intercropped with cowpea and soybean had the highest legume participation in the mixture, promoting an increase in crude protein and ivDMD content of haylage and hay. Haylage and hay had the same chemical composition, although haylage had higher ivDMD than hay. We concluded that intercropping Tamani grass with soybeans or cowpea maintained total biomass productivity and improved the nutritional value of haylage and hay.

However, it is unclear whether lint yield with single dose application of reduced N at early flowering will increase N use efficiency without lint yield reduction in such a system. In a two-year field study, cotton was directly sown after wheat harvest on 20 May and fertilized one time at early flowering with 0 (N0), 90 (N90), 180 (N180), 270 (N270), or 360 (N360) kg N ha(-1). Cotton yield, biomass accumulation and partitioning, N uptake and use efficiency, critical N dilution curve, and physiological parameters related to N metabolism were determined. In the two experimental years, N180 did not differ from N270 and N360 in seed cotton yield but was 55.4% higher than N0 and 11.5% higher than N90. N180 was considerably higher than N0 and N90 in biomass but was comparable with N270 and N360 after peak blooming. By contrast, the harvest index in N180 was comparable with or slightly lower than that in N0 and N90 but was considerably higher than that in N270 and N360. Compared with lower N rates, the increase in biomass in N180 was attributed to the increased duration or rate of biomass accumulation in the rapid accumulation period of biomass. Compared with higher N rates, the increase in harvest index in N180 was largely due to increased partitioning of assimilates to fruiting sites. Total N content in source, flow, and sink organs increased with the increase in N fertilizer rate. Critical N dilution curves showed that the N nutrition index of sink organs (NNIso) increased with the increase in N fertilizer rate. The NNIso in N180 was closer to 1 than the index in the other N rate treatments and therefore should be the optimal N rate in this system. The N use efficiency (NUE) in N180 was similar to or slightly lower than that in N90 but was considerably higher than that in N270 and N360. Nitrate-N and soluble protein contents in petioles or leaves in N180 were comparable with those in N270 and N360 but were much higher than those in N0 and N90, which was consistent with the seed cotton yields under the different N rates. Overall, N fertilization rate can effectively regulate N metabolism, NUE, biomass accumulation and distribution, and seed cotton yield and yield components. Thus, to optimize yield, NUE, and NNIso, 180 kg N ha(-1) applied at early flowering is recommended compared with other N rates in wheat-cotton double cropping systems.

Wilczek], also known as green gram is cultivated on area of 4.75 million ha in kharif and rabi/ spring seasons as monocrop or intercrop in India. It serves as a major source of dietary protein for the vast majority of vegetarian people in the country. Mungbean contributed 10.03 per cent of total pulses production (23.40 million tonnes) in the country with productivity level of 494 kg ha(-1) in 2018-19. The pulses cultivation in Haryana is almost eliminated in kharif season owing to deviation of area towards cotton, cluster bean and pearlmillet because of low profitability. However, the new window opens for cultivation of mungbean in rice-wheat cropping system in summer season to generate additional farm income and to improve soil health. The area under summer mungbean in state was around 64 thousand ha with the production of 50 thousand tonnes and the average productivity of 780 kg/ha during 2017-18. Although rice-wheat system provides better farm returns, but it has imposed threat to soil health, availability and contamination of ground water, weed and biotic stress management. Methods: The data pertains to costs and returns from summer mungbean cultivation was gathered from 60 mungbean cultivators of Hisar, Kurukshetra and Panipat districts of Haryana having adequate irrigation water availability adopting personal interaction approach in 2018-19. Simple budgeting technique was employed to draw practical implications which ultimately help to take favourable policy decisions for enhancing acreage of summer mungbean. Result: The inquiry profound that mungbean cultivation in summer season particularly in rice-wheat was established as additional income generation farm enterprise. The net benefits accrued from short duration varieties of mungbean over variable cost was Rs. 31831 ha(-1) with time span of 60-70 days by utilizing fallow land in summer season. The B-C ratio toiled considering expenses incurred on variable resources with value of 2.99 divulges economic viability of mungbean cultivation in the study area. It is imperative from results that cultivation of short duration cultivars of mungbean is viable option to enhance farm income, restoration of diminishing soil fertility owing to adoption of continuous rice-wheat rotation by inherent characteristics of converting atmospheric nitrogen. Distinctive efforts are essential to evolve mungbean cultivars suitable to prevailing cropping system in Haryana and assure market procurement. The exploration of mungbean cultivation will reduce dependency on import and improve net availability of pulses in India.	"[Malik, D. P.; Bishnoi, D.

Soil organic C affected by dry-season management of no-till soybean crop rotations in the tropics	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						"Conservation management; Cropping systems; Soil carbon stock; Crop residue quality"	"GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; COVER CROPS; CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; LAND-USE; MATTER; NITROGEN; DYNAMICS; SYSTEM; STRAW"	Aims Cover crop species selection for soybean (Glycine max) production under no-tillage (NT) management may affect soil organic C sequestration by altering the quantity and quality of C inputs, thereby affecting cropping system sustainability. If so, the underlying mechanisms for such regulation are still unclear. Methods We assessed changes in soil C and N fractions at 0-0.1 m depth and soil C stock at 0-0.6 m depth during the last three years of dry-season cover cropping in a soybean production system managed with NT for 9 years on a Rhodic Hapludox in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Dry-season management treatments were repeated yearly in a split-plot scheme. Main plots during the fall-winter were (1) ruzigrass (Urochloa ruziziensis), (2) grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and (3) the intercropping of ruzigrass and sorghum. Subplots during spring prior to planting soybean were (a) pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), (b) sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea), and (c) forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). Results Soil C and N fractions were affected according to crop residue characteristics of the rotations. Higher soil C stocks in 2012 and 2015 (7 % an average) were observed at 0.2-0.4 m depth by ruzigrass compared to sorghum. High crop residue input with ruzigrass in the fall-winter sequestered 0.61 Mg C ha(- 1) yr(- 1) at 0-0.1 m soil depth compared with lower C sequestration using grain sorghum (0.29 Mg C ha(- 1) yr(- 1)). Conclusions The quantity and quality of crop residues impact its retention on soil surface controlling the dynamics of soil C and N fractions and can be considered relevant for soil C sequestration. These aspects could contribute to the mitigation of atmospheric CO2 in crop production systems.

Legume-oilseed intercropping in mechanised broadacre agriculture - a review	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Review						"Brassica; Competition; Cover crop; Crucifer; Fabaceae; Nitrogen; Nutrient dynamics; Water"		Intercropping aims to exploit complementary and facilitative interactions between species to improve capture and efficiency in the use of resources, and yield and profit per unit land and time. This review uses the ecological theory of intercropping to investigate the agronomic benefits and drawbacks of legume-oilseed intercropping and its place in mechanised broadacre agriculture. Complementary, competitive and facilitative interactions between species are analysed with a focus on nutrients and water in a range of legume oilseed pairings including peacanola, soybean-sunflower, and chickpea-flax. Of the 41 studies investigated, 35 report yield, nutrient-use efficiency, or economic benefits of legume-oilseed intercropping. Legume-oilseed intercrops appear to negate many of the agronomic and technical issues associated with the more traditional cereal-legume pairings, and offer novel benefits such as the break-crop advantage to cereal dominant systems, and allelopathic pest repellence. While many of the traditional constraints to manage intercrops in broadacre mechanised systems appear to be tractable, this review also identifies priorities for further research and development of legume-oilseed intercrops. We conclude that legume-oilseed species pairings may have potential as commercially viable, large scale intercrops, as an effective means to improve productivity in broadacre mechanised agricultural systems.

New oilseed-bearing cash cover crops, such as winter camelina (Camelina sativa L.) and pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.), may provide needed incentives. However, the abilities of these crops to sequester labile soil nutrients are unknown. To address this unknown, N in shoot biomass, plant-available N and P in soil, and NO3--N and soluble reactive P in soil water collected from lysimeters placed at 30, 60, and 100 cm were measured in cover crop and fallow treatments established in spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) stubble and followed through a cover crop-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation. Five no-till cover treatments (forage radish [Raphanus sativus L.], winter rye [Secale cereale L.], field pennycress, and winter camelina) were compared with two fallow treatments (chisel till and no-till). Pennycress and winter camelina were harvested at maturity after relay sowing of soybean. Winter rye and radish sequestered more N in autumn shoot biomass, ranging from 26 to 38 kg N ha(-1), but overwintering oilseeds matched or exceeded N uptake in spring, ranging 28 to 49 kg N ha(-1) before soybean planting. Nitrogen uptake was reflected by reductions in soil water NO3--N during cover crop and intercropping phases for all cover treatments (mean = 4 mg L-1), compared with fallow treatments (mean = 31 mg L-1). Cash cover crops like pennycress and winter camelina provide both environmental and potential economic resources to growers. They are cash-generating crops able to sequester labile soil nutrients, which protects and promotes soil health from autumn through early summer.

We investigated the roles of rhizospheric and endospheric diazotrophs in soil nutrient transformation. Materials and methods We conducted two field experiments with three treatments: sugarcane monoculture, sugarcane + peanut intercrop, and sugarcane + soybean intercrop. Soil and plant samples were collected and the nutrient content, enzymatic activity, and diazotroph population were assessed. The nitrogenase (nifH) gene and 16S rRNA gene were used for molecular characterization. Correlation analysis was performed to discover the relations among the soil variables, plant variables, and microbial communities. Results and discussion The multiple variance analysis results indicated that the intercropping systems had a significant (p<0.05) effect on soil total P, available K, and soil enzyme dehydrogenase. Higher diazotrophic populations in the rhizosphere and plant endosphere were recovered by sugarcane intercropping. The soybean intercrop had the maximum unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs). A total of 64 nifH gene-positive bacteria were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The BLAST search results classified all diazotrophs into five taxonomic groups: gamma-Proteobacteria (28%), Actinobacteria (28%), Firmicutes (25%), beta-Proteobacteria (11%), and alpha-Proteobacteria (8%). All identified bacteria had multiple plant growth-promoting abilities, and only 58% of the bacteria utilized aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) as their sole carbon source. Furthermore, the higher yield and gamma-Proteobacteria positively correlated with soil organic matter, and urease activity revealed that intercropping improved soil fertility. Conclusions Our study concluded that the intercropping system enriched the beneficial diazotrophs in the plant rhizosphere and endosphere and that these microbes could enhance plant growth and serve as effective bioinoculants to sustain sugarcane production. Moreover, higher soil nutrients (NKP) and biological activity showed the significance of our intercropping practice of a short-duration leguminous crop and a long-duration grass crop, and this practice would be a good solution to reduce the overuse of chemical fertilizers.

Cereal-legume intercropping modifies the dynamics of the active rhizospheric bacterial community	RHIZOSPHERE			English	Article								We assessed the impact of intercropping on the microbial communities in the rhizosphere of wheat (Triticum turgidum L. ssp durum) and pea (Pisum sativum L.). Using a RNA based approach coupled with bacterial phylum specific real time PCR, we found that the active bacterial communities in the wheat-pea association were distinct from those in the rhizosphere when crops were cultivated solely. This first explorative study showed that intercropping induced a synergetic interaction, which modified the structure of active microbial communities associated with roots by reducing the representation of Alpha-Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria while promoting Actinobacteria. The latter phylum harbors many species identified as growth promoting bacteria, calling for further analyses to better understand their function for intercropped cultures.

The following treatments were applied: T1, overseeding of millet + seeding of oat FMS-1; T2, overseeding of millet + direct seeding of oat IPR-126; T3, overseeding of millet + direct seeding of oat IPR-61; T4, overseeding of Tanzania grass (Panicum maximum) + overseeding of Brachiaria ruziziensis; T5, direct seeding of sorghum + Brachiaria ruziziensis. The experimental units consisted of 1.5-ha pastures allocated in a completely randomized design with two replicates. The variables measured were forage production, forage mass, soybean production, and forage residue in direct seeding. In all cuts, forage mass was higher in paddocks with Brachiaria ruziziensis compared to the other treatments, especially Brachiaria ruziziensis with Tanzania grass. The higher forage mass was a consequence of the higher forage production observed in these paddocks. This result shows that tropical grasses could be an alternative to cool-season grasses for winter pasture. On the other hand, no significant difference in soybean production was observed between the strategies used. However, the higher long-term deposition of organic matter in soil resulting from the greater forage mass may contribute to increase productivity. In conclusion, intercropping of Tanzania grass with Brachiaria ruziziensis in integrated crop-livestock systems appears to be an alternative that provides high grain and forage productivity."

Trees were either fully irrigated (C), subjected to moderate water deficit (RDI) or subjected to moderate water deficit and associated with a grass-legume mixture on the entire orchard floor (RDI +G). Irrigation was scheduled according to soil water potential target ranges in order to keep C trees above -0.02 MPa, i.e. at field capacity, and RDI and RDI + G trees between -0.04 MPa and -0.06 MPa. The level of water deficit obtained was moderate but yet significantly reduced by 50% overall tree growth in 2014 in RDI. This reduction was enhanced when water deficit lasted longer and when it was associated with grass in RDI+ G. No reduction in growth variables occurred in RDI in 2015 due to the shorter duration of water deficit. Overall reduction was observed in 2015 in RDI + G mostly due to a carry-over effect of the previous year. Net photosynthesis was reduced by the longer and more intense water deficit in 2014, but was not reduced during the soil water deficit in 2015. An indicator of plant process sensitivity to water deficit, taking into account the variable reduction with regards to the control, the water deficit intensity and its duration was used to classify shoot growth variables and net photosynthesis according to their sensitivity to water deficit. Variables could be classified according to the following order of ascending sensitivity: net photosynthesis <1st order final leaf number < final tree height <1st order final shoot length <2nd order final leaf number<2nd order final shoot number <2nd order final shoot length. Applying a moderate water deficit combined with full grass cover drastically reduces overall tree size due to grass competition. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two fertilization regimes were applied with plots fertilized with either a high or a low rate of mineral nitrogen (N) fertilizer. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was used to evaluate the carbon footprint (global warming potential) of the grassland management including measured nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions after sward incorporation. Without applying any mineral N fertilizer, the forage legume pure stand, especially red clover, was able to produce about 15 t aboveground dry matter ha(-1) year(-1) saving around 325 kg mineral N fertilizer ha(-1) compared to the cocksfoot and tall fescue grass treatments. The pure stand ryegrass yielded around 3 t DM more than red clover in the high fertilizer treatment. Nitrous oxide emissions were highest in the treatments containing legumes. The LCA showed that the low input N systems had markedly lower carbon footprint values than crops from the high N input system with the pure stand legumes without N fertilization having the lowest carbon footprint. Thus, a reduction in N fertilizer application rates in the low input systems offsets increased N2O emissions after forage legume treatments compared to grass plots due to the N fertilizer production-related emissions. When including the subsequent wheat yield in the total aboveground production across the three-season rotation, the pure stand red clover without N application and pure stand ryegrass treatments with the highest N input equalled. The present study illustrate how leguminous biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) represents an important low impact renewable N source without reducing crop yields and thereby farmers earnings.

Intensifying Grain and Fodder Production in Tibet by Using Cereal-Forage Intercrops	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							"YIELD; DORMANCY; QUALITY; CLIMATE; LUCERNE; CHINA"	In the river valleys of central Tibet, farming households are active in both crop and livestock production. The emphasis is mostly placed on optimizing grain production for subsistence purposes, with little emphasis on forage production to meet livestock diets. Temperatures and rainfall favor crop growth from April to October and, with crops harvested in July or August, sufficient moisture, heat, and light resources remain unused after forage harvest. Here we report data from crop-forage intercrop experiments that evaluated the role of using vetch (Vicia sativa L.) and lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) established by either broadcast or seeding in inter-row spaces of cereal crops. Broadcasting vetch in early July into maturing winter sown wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) allows useful amounts of vetch forage (3 Mg ha(-1)) produced for little extra work with minimal grain yield penalty. The approach of sowing vetch in the inter-row space of widely spaced winter wheat or barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was a reliable way of establishing this forage crop. However, grain yield losses (P <= 0.05) of approximately 16, 22, and 37% were associated with the wider row spacing (66, 50, and 33% wheat) when vetch was grown in the inter-row space. Based on land equivalent ratios (LERs) alone, the 33% cereal density was most productive (P <= 0.05). However, improved understanding of forage, dairy products, and grain markets, and of the household economy on typical Tibetan farms, will be required before judgments can be made about whether farmers can profit from such intercropping approaches.

The study aimed to evaluate the nutritional status, vigour and yield of grapevines intercropped with some species of cover crops under two different managements. A field experiment was conducted for two years, 2009 through 2011, in a vineyard of cv Cabernet Sauvignon in a Haplumbrept soil. The following treatments were evaluated: a control, where weeds were controlled by chemical drying in the grapevine row and by mowing in the inter row; a perennial species, tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea); two sequences of annual species, ryegrass-moha (Lolium multiflorum-Setaria italica) and oat-buckwheat (Avena sativa-Fagopyrum esculentum); and two types of crop residues management, with and without its transfer of the grapevine row to the inter row. The grapevine leaves were sampled at flowering and at berries softening stages for analysis of N, P, K, Ca and Mg contents. It was determined the branches and internodes lengths, branches pruned mass, grape bunches length, width and mass, yield per plant and the weight of 100 berries and it was also calculated the Ravaz index of the grapevines. Grapevines intercropped with succession of annual cover crops showed higher total N content in leaves at flowering, vigour and grape yield. The transfer of the crop residue from the row to the inter row, did not affect the grapevine vigour and yield, but decreased the total content of N in the leaves at flowering. The tall fescue as soil cover crop in vineyard can be an effective alternative to reduce the vigor of the grapevine."

For environmental reasons, farming systems used in higher rainfall regions should ideally target use of more perennials in the landscape without impacting farm productivity or profitability. Intercropping may provide the opportunity to achieve this, where the pasture component is a perennial species. The perennial pasture species lucerne (Aurora Medicago sativa L.) and chicory (Puna Cichorium intybus L.) were established and maintained for three seasons with annually sown crop species (Whistler wheat [Triticum aestivum L], Wonga lupin [Lupinus angustifolius L] and Sapphire canola [Brassica napus L.]) in a double skip row arrangement. These intercrops were compared for production and productivity with individual crops and pastures grown as monoculture stands. Grain crop yields were reduced when grown in intercrop with lucerne and chicory. Yield reductions ranged from 0 to 46% for wheat, 45 to 74% for lupin, and 8 to 83% for canola. Pasture dry matter was also reduced when intercropped, with reductions ranging from 0 to 78% for lucerne and 19 to 78% for chicory. Despite reductions in crop and pasture production, the land equivalent ratio (LER) ranged from 0.42 to 1.78, with most intercrop combinations overyielding. Chicory was well adapted as an intercrop species, with chicory intercrops overyielding more frequently than lucerne intercrops. In addition, the overyielding of lupin and canola intercrops demonstrates the potential to expand intercropping to include break crops, creating a more flexible system suited to southeastern Australia.

A three-year (2009-2011) field experiment was conducted by using a randomized block design with two N application levels (N1, 300 kg hm(-2) and N2, 525 kg hm(-2)) and four crop arrangement patterns (soybean monoculture, sugarcane monoculture, 1:1 row sugarcane-soybean intercropping, 1:2 row sugarcane-soybean intercropping). The crop yield and nitrogen acquisition of sugarcane and soybean, and quality of sugarcane juice were determined at the maturity stages of soybean or sugarcane. Land equivalent ratio (LER) was used to evaluate the potential advantages of the intercrops, aggressivity (AG), and competitive ratio (CR) which based on crop yield and nitrogen acquisition were used to evaluate interspecific competition between sugarcane and soybean. The results indicated that sugarcane-soybean intercropping system had intercropping advantages based on total LER in the three-year. Sugarcane had lower AG and CR values than soybean. The quality of sugarcane juice was not significantly different between intercropping and monoculture, except the excessive nitrogen application (N2) in 2011, which reduced the apparent purity and gravity of sugarcane juice significantly compared with normal nitrogen application (N1). This paper suggests that the intercropping advantage of sugarcane-soybean system is mainly contributed by soybean. The introduction of soybean in a sugarcane field does not significantly affect the quality of sugarcane juice. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The experiment was conducted using a crop rotation system of: potato-winter wheat+intercrop -spring barley+undersown and red clover+grasses. The soil was treated with organic fertilisation in the form of manure under potato at doses of 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80t center dot ha -1, and with nitrogen at doses of 0, 40, 80 and 120kgN center dot ha -1. A supplement of manure at 80t center dot ha -1 resulted in the greatest significant increase in soil total selenium content of 100% compared with soil from control plots. We observed that interaction of the highest manure and nitrogen doses resulted in a significant decrease in the total selenium content of the soil. Selenium content in soil was statistically highly correlated with organic carbon content.

J	"Hansen, LM; Lorentsen, L; Boelt, B"				"Hansen, Lars Monrad; Lorentsen, Louise; Boelt, Birte"			How to reduce the incidence of black bean aphids (Aphis fabae Scop.) attacking organic growing field beans (Vicia faba L.) by growing partially resistant bean varieties and by intercropping field beans with cereals	ACTA AGRICULTURAE SCANDINAVICA SECTION B-SOIL AND PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						"Aphis fabae; economic yield; pulses"	"INFESTATION; HOMOPTERA; YIELDS; PESTS"	There is an increasing demand for organically grown pulses and cereal grains in Denmark, which is expected to cause a change in the typical organic farm structure away from dairy farming and towards arable farming. Spring field beans (Vicia faba) could be a popular break crop in organic agriculture. The black bean aphid (Aphis fabae) is generally considered to be a serious pest of spring-sown field beans in northern Europe, and field studies have shown that yield losses can exceed more than 50% due to attacks from the black bean aphid. The use of insecticides in organically grown field bean crops is not permitted, but it has been known for a long time that the black bean aphid infests different varieties of beans to a very different extent. Therefore, partial resistance to the black bean aphid is one method of stabilizing yields. Another method of cultural pest control is intercropping and a third method could be a combination of both. Six field experiments involving the three methods were carried out. There was a significant difference between the number of aphids per plant on the three investigated bean varieties, where 'Colombo' was the most susceptible, 'Quattro' was intermediate, and 'Caspar' the most resistant variety. 'Colombo' intercropping with spring wheat and spring barley reduced the numbers of aphids per plant significantly, and also the number of plants infested. The harvesting of all crops took place during the last fourteen days of August. It can be concluded that the growing of partial host plant resistant varieties of field beans or the intercropping of field beans with spring cereals separately will reduce the infestation with black bean aphids. If both methods are used, the reduction of infestation will be even higher and consequently also the yield.

The objective of this work was to investigate the relative competitive ability of wheat crop with the weeds Italian ryegrass or wild radish. Three experiments were conducted under greenhouse at UFPel, in 2006. The treatments were conducted in a completely randomized design, with four replications, with the treatments arranged in replacement series. The proportions of wheat plants and competitors Italian ryegrass or wild radish were: 100/0. 75/ 25. 50/50, 25/75 and 0/100, always with a total population of 900 plants m(-2). Competitiveness statistical analysis consisted in applying diagrams to the replacement series and interpreting the competitiveness indices. The competitive relationships between wheat and ryegrass or between wheat and wild radish plants are altered by the proportion of plants that compose the association. Wheat shows superior competitive ability to ryegrass but inferior to wild radish when the species have similar proportions of plants in the associations and when these species occur in the same ecological niche.

Effects of border crops and intercrops on control of cucurbit virus diseases	PLANT DISEASE			English	Article							"APHID-BORNE VIRUSES; RESISTANCE; WATERMELON; POTYVIRUS; SPREAD; SQUASH"	In five field trials over 3 years, control of aphid-transmitted, nonpersistent virus diseases on pumpkin, caused mostly by the potyviruses Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV) and Papaya ringspot virus type-W (PRSV-W), was achieved by intercropping with grain sorghum, as opposed to clean tillage. Reductions in disease incidence ranged from 43 to 96% (P < 0.05). Surrounding, pumpkin plots with borders of peanut, soybean, or corn was not effective. Borders of grain sorghum were effective, but disease control was generally less than for the intercrop treatment. Intercropping soybean and peanut with pumpkin reduced disease incidence by 27 to 60% (P <= 0.05), but disease control generally was less than for grain sorghum. Peak periods of alate aphid immigration generally preceded virus disease outbreaks by 7 to 14 days. However, alate landing rates, as measured in green tile traps, did not differ among treatments. Marketable yield was not increased by the intercrop treatments, and yield was reduced by up to 50% for the intercrop treatment with grain sorghum in two trials. The use of grass-selective herbicide applied along pumpkin rows, reduced seeding rates of the intercrops, or mowing did not alleviate the adverse effects of competition between pumpkin and the grain sorghum intercrop on yield.

During the rainy season, sole sorghum was found to have significantly higher DMA and productivity in terms of soybean equivalent yield (SEY) than sole soybean or soybean + sorghum intercropping. Increasing the N dose from 0 to 100 % RDN significantly improved the DMA and SEY. At a low fertility level (N-0), soybean + sorghum intercropping was found to be more productive, while at a high fertility level (100 % RDN), sole sorghum was more productive than the other two cropping systems. However, during the post-rainy season, sole soybean as the preceding crop gave the highest DMA and seed yield of wheat, which were similar to those found with soybean + sorghum intercropping. Sorghum followed by wheat gave the lowest DMA and seed yield of wheat. Application of 100 % RDN irrespective of cropping system during the preceding crop improved the DMA of wheat but not its seed yield. However, N applied to the wheat crop significantly increased its DMA and seed yield.

Random amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR) dominant markers were used to assess genetic variability in the aphid Sitobion avenae (Fabricius) in relation to hydroxamic acid levels in their host-plants. Colonies of aphids belonging to a single RAPD-PCR profile were grown on different host-plants differing in their Hx content under greenhouse conditions. The RAPD-PCR phenotypic pattern showed the appearance of two new RAPD-PCR variants after four to five generations of exposure to wheat cv. Chagual (high Hx levels), one after exposure to wheat cv. Huayun (low Hx levels), and none after exposure to oat (lacking Hx). Differential appearance of new RAPD-PCR aphid phenotypes also occurred on field-grown wheat. While the overall phenotypic 'richness' diminished during the season, the number of RAPD-PCR phenotypes decreased on cv. Huayun and increased on cv. Chagual. The preferential appearance in the field and in the greenhouse of new RAPD-PCR phenotypes of S. avenae on cv. Chagual is discussed on the basis of mutagenesis induced by hydroxamic acids and by the products of their transformation within the aphid. Aphid abundance is interpreted in terms of antixenosis and antibiosis by hydroxamic acids. The appearance on cv. Chagual of phenotypes first detected on cv. Huayun was accounted for by intercrop migrations.

J	Craufurd, PQ				Craufurd, PQ			Effect of plant density on the yield of sorghum-cowpea and pearl millet-cowpea intercrops in northern Nigeria	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article							"PRODUCTIVITY; CULTIVARS; TROPICS; SYSTEMS"	Three alternate-row intercrop experiments of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor)-cowpea ( Vigna unguiculata) and/or millet (Pennisetum glaucum)-cowpea were grown at plant densities of 20 000 to 80 000 plants ha(-1) at two locations in northern Nigeria between 1990 and 1992 to examine relations between yield and plant density. These relations were examined using the reciprocals of yield per plant to determine effects of environment, species and genotype on the theoretical maximum yield and optimum plant density. The intercrops were dominated by cereals, and cowpea biomass (BY) and seed yield (SY) were < 10% of cereal BY and SY. Cowpea yields decreased as cereal plant density (D) increased, whereas cereal and total intercrop yields increased asymptotically with increasing D. Biomass yield of all intercrops responded to increasing D in a similar manner and the theoretical maximum intercrop BY was 12 290 kg ha(-1) in all experiments. The response of SY to D varied among intercrops and was greatest and least with early and late maturing cereals respectively. The optimum D required to produce 90% maximum intercrop BY and SY varied between 15 600 and 30 000 plants ha(-1) and 0 (no response to D) and 120 000 plants ha(-1) respectively, and was higher for sorghum than for miller intercrops. The implications of these responses for agronomic management and germplasm improvement of cereal-cowpea intercrops are discussed.

Subplot treatments consisted of point injection of N-15-enriched NH4NO3 (67 kg N ha(-1)) in-row at three row positions within the corn strips. Grain and stover yield, Kjeldahl N, and isotope composition of plant materials were determined. Corn yield and labeled-N recovery differed with tillage to the extent that tillage affected early and total season moisture availability. Labeled-N recovery in labeled rows did not differ with row position. Labeled-N recovery in unlabeled rows or crop borders was typically less than 5% of that recovered by labeled rows.

Merr.], and oat (Avena sativa L.) interseeded with nondormant alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), was established in south-central Iowa on a poorly drained Haig soil (fine, smectitic, mesic Vertic Argiaquoll). In 1989 (a dry year) and 1990 (a wet year), we studied the effect of tillage treatment (conventional, CT; reduced, RT; and no-till, NT) and row position on soil water content, canopy and air temperatures, corn grain yield, and yield components. No-till resulted in the most favorable soil water status, plant water status, and grain yield in 1989, No-till had the poorest performance in 1990, mainly because of excessive soil water, The opposite was true for conventional till in both years, Reduced till yield equaled that for the most productive tillage treatment in both years, Conventional and reduced tillage resulted in lower corn grain yield at the border with oat-alfalfa than with soybean because oat depleted soil water more than soybean in both years, In contrast, for no-till the corn grain yield at the border with oat-alfalfa was 6% greater than corn yield bordering soybean in 1989 and 13% greater in 1990, When water was not limiting, in 1990, both corn borders outyielded the center rows by an average of 14% in NT, 27% in RT, and 28% in CT. Soil water content rankings throughout the 1989 season were NT > RT > CT and row position rankings were soybean border > center > oats-alfalfa border, In 1990, there were no soil water content differences between tillage treatments and row positions, Reduced tillage Is the most suitable soil management system for corn production with three-crop strip intercropping on this soil, considering consistently high relative yields for both wet and dry years."

J	"WALL, DA; CAMPBELL, CG"				"WALL, DA; CAMPBELL, CG"			COMPETITIVENESS OF LATHYRUS GROWN IN MONOCULTURE AND INTERCROPPING SYSTEMS WITH CEREALS	JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE			English	Article								Lathyrus (Lathyrus sativus L.) is a grain legume being developed for possible use in western Canada. Two studies were conducted under dryland conditions in southern Manitoba from 1989 to 1991, to investigate the yield response of lathyrus to increasing density of volunteer cereals and to evaluate the potential to intercrop lathyrus and semi-dwarf wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Lathyrus yields decreased with increasing density of volunteer wheat and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). In 1989 and 1991, volunteer cereals at five plants/sq yd reduced lathyrus yields by 37 and 6% in each year, respectively. Yield losses were greater in 1989 than 1991 due to below normal precipitation. When intercropped, wheat was more competitive than lathyrus and competition increased between species when row spacing was reduced from 12 to 6 in. Land equivalent ratios (LER) for intercropped treatments were 0.89 to 1.08 and 1.09 to 1.43 in 1990 and 1991, respectively. In 1990, at 12-in. row spacings, and in 1991, at both row spacings, LER was greater than 1 and suggested that intercropped lathyrus and wheat was more productive than monocultures. From these studies, we conclude that lathyrus is noncompetitive with volunteer cereals, and that successful cultivation of lathyrus will require that it be grown on weed-free land with herbicides to control weeds. Intercropping lathyrus and wheat, although feasible, may not increase productivity in every year.

Results revealed that intercropping system of sorghum + pigeonpea recorded the highest monetary returns of Rs. 12565/ha and it was significantly superior over all other intercropping systems. Pigeonpea + pearlmillet acquired the second highest position in monetary returns followed by pearlmillet + pigeonpea. The lowest monetary returns were recorded with cotton + soybean intercropping system. Pearlmillet + pigeonpea made the highest moisture use of 492.2 mm as compared to all other intercropping systems, followed by pigeonpea + pearlmillet and cotton + blackgram. However, the highest moisture use efficiency of 22.1 Rs/mm/ha was observed in sorghum + pigeonpea. It was followed by pigeonpea + pearlmillet and pearlmillet + pigeonpea on monetary return basis. Similarly, the highest moisture use efficiency of 5.2 kg/mm/ha was recorded by pearlmillet + pigeonpea followed by pigeonpea + pearlmillet and sorghum + pigeonpea intercropping system on grain yield basis.

Co-learning cycles to support the design of innovative farm systems in southern Mali	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"Food self-sufficiency; Income; Ex ante trade-off analysis; Participatory research"	"CROP-LIVESTOCK SYSTEMS; SOIL FERTILITY MANAGEMENT; WEST-AFRICA; AGRICULTURAL-RESEARCH; CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACT; COTTON; INTENSIFICATION; ADAPTATION; KNOWLEDGE"	"Farm systems were re-designed together with farmers during three years (2013-2015) in Southern Mali with the aim to improve income without compromising food self-sufficiency. A cyclical learning model with three steps was used: Step 1 was the co-design of a set of crop/livestock technical options, Step 2 the on-farm testing and appraisal of these options and Step 3 a participatory ex-ante analysis of re-designed farm systems incorporating the tested options. Two iterations of the cycle were performed, in order to incorporate farmers' point of view and researchers' learning. We worked together with 132 farmers representing four farm types: High Resource Endowed with Large Herd (HRE-LH); High Resource Endowed (HRE); Medium Resource Endowed (MRE) and Low Resource Endowed (LRE) farms. In the first cycle of 2012-2014 farmers re-designed their farms and the reconfigurations were assessed ex mite using the average yields and gross margins obtained in the 2013 on-farm trials. HRE-LH farmers experienced a disappointing decrease in food self-sufficiency and MRE farmers were disappointed by the marginal improvement in gross margin. In a second cycle in 2014-2015, farmer insights gathered during field days and statistical analysis of trial results allowed a better understanding of the variability of option performance and the link with farm context: niches were identified within the farms (soil type/previous crop combinations) where options performed better. The farm systems were re-designed using this niche specific information on yield and gross margin, which solved the concerns voiced by farmers during the first cycle. Without compromising food self-sufficiency, maize/cowpea intercropping in the right niche combined with stall feeding increased HRE-LH and HRE farm gross margin by 20-26% respectively (i.e. 690 and 545 US$ year(-1)) with respect to the current farm system. Replacement of sorghum by soyabean (or cowpea) increased MRE and LRE farm gross margin by 29 and 9% respectively (i.e. 545 and 32 US$ year(-1)). Farmers highlighted the saliency of the niches and the re-designed farm system, and indicated that the extra income could be reinvested in the farm. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and the usefulness of a cyclical and adaptive combination of participatory approaches, on-farm trials and ex-ante analysis to foster learning by farmers and researchers, allowing an agile reorientation of project actions and the generation of innovative farm systems that improve farm income without compromising food self-sufficiency. The re-designed farm systems based on simple, reproducible guidelines such as farm type, previous crop and soil type can be scaled-out by extension workers and guide priority setting in (agricultural) policies and institutional development."

Intercropping Time of Corn and Palisadegrass or Guineagrass Affecting Grain Yield and Forage Production	CROP SCIENCE			English	Article							"CROP-LIVESTOCK SYSTEMS; BRACHIARIA-BRIZANTHA; COVER CROPS; MANAGEMENT; MAIZE; PERFORMANCE; FERTILIZER; HERBICIDE; CULTIVARS; BEHAVIOR"	Intercropping corn (Zea mays L.) with forages, such as palisadegrass {Urochloa brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich.) R. D. Webster [syn. Brachiaria brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich.) Stapf]} or guineagrass [Megathyrsus maximus (Jacq.) B. K. Simon & S. W. L. Jacobs (syn. Panicum maximum Jacq.)], provides large amounts of biomass for use as straw in no-tillage systems or as pasture. However, it is important to evaluate what time these forages have to be sown into corn systems to avoid reductions in both corn and forage production. This study, conducted for three growing seasons at Botucatu, Brazil, evaluated nutrient concentration and yield of corn as affected by time of forage intercropped as well as forage's dry matter production. Our data showed that intercropping systems did not reduce leaf nutrient concentrations and grain yield of corn in relation to sole corn. The simultaneous intercropping of corn and guineagrass resulted in the lowest plant population (51,200 plant ha(-1)), number of ears per plant (1.0), and, consequently, the lowest corn grain yield (9801 kg ha(-1)). Guineagrass seeded at the time of corn fertilizer topdressing resulted in the highest plant population (59,400 plants ha(-1)), number of ears per plant (1.2), and corn grain yield (12,077 kg ha(-1)). Forage production was highest when intercrop was done simultaneously. Palisadegrass could be intercropped with corn both simultaneously or at topdressing fertilization stage. In contrast, it is recommended that guineagrass should only be intercropped with corn at topdressing fertilization.

The aim of this study was to evaluate growth and dry matter production in two cultivars of sorghum, inoculated or not with diazotrophic bacteria, and as a monocrop or intercropped with palisade grass under a system of crop-livestock integration. The experiments were carried out in the field in the Cerrado region during the autumn-winter period of 2015 and 2016, on the experimental farm of the Faculty of Engineering at Ilha Solteira, UNESP, in Selviria, in the State of Mato Groso do Sul, Brazil (MS). A randomised complete block experimental design was used in a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial scheme with four replications. The treatments corresponded to two agricultural years (2015 and 2016); the cultivation of dual-purpose grain sorghum, alone or intercropped with palisade grass; with or without inoculation of the sorghum seeds with the bacterium Azospirillum brasilense. The dry matter production of the plant components and plant growth were evaluated for the preparation of silage. Inoculation of sorghum seeds with the bacterium Azospirillum brasilense increases the production of plant dry matter for silage, irrespective of the cultivar or intercrop. Dual-purpose grain sorghum intercropped with palisade grass is a viable agronomic system for producing plant matter for silage during the autumn season."

Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the canopy, radiation use efficiency (RUE), leaf photosynthetic characteristics, dry matter accumulation and allocation, and yield of proso millet were investigated. The results showed that the intercropping systems had higher PAR than the monoculture. Mean PAR intensities were increased by respectively 2.2%-23.4%, 19.8%-59.7%, and 61.2%-133.3% in the proso millet upper, middle and lower canopies compared with SP. The increase in PAR directly increased RUE, a result attributed mainly to the increase in photosynthetic capacity, including net photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content. These responses resulted in increased dry matter allocation to plant organs. Yield of intercropped proso millet was 6.8%-37.3% higher than that under monoculture and the land equivalent ratios for the different intercropping patterns were all greater than unity (> 1). In general, yield followed a positive linear function of PAR in the intercropping system. The results indicated that intercropping can boost proso millet yield, evidently by altering light distribution within its canopy and consequently increasing RUE, thereby increasing leaf photosynthetic capacity, dry matter accumulation, and allocation to the grain. The optimum combination for improving the growth and yield of proso millet on the Loess Plateau of China was 2P4M. (c) 2019 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS.

Results showed that intercropping increased leaf photosynthesis, as measured by the increased net photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content, maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII, and decreased nonphotochemical quenching coefficient. These responses resulted in the increased leaf number and area and reduced yellowing leaf rate; leaf photosynthetic capacity was maintained for longer periods. Such improvements occurred due to enhanced activities of protective enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase) and lowered malondialdehyde and superoxide radical contents. This conclusion was supported by the increased N metabolism in leaves. The grain yield was stimulated by 6.8-37.3% compared to the sole system.

In this experiment, the intercropping of forage sorghum with lathyrus and hairy vetch at six levels with single cropping of forage sorghum, lathyrus, and hairy vetch, and three weed management strategies (no weed control, full weed control, and single weed control) was evaluated. The results showed that most forage sorghum traits were significantly (p <= 0.05) affected by different sowing ratios. The highest fresh forage yield of sorghum (77.9 ton/ha) and lowest (49.0 ton/ha) were obtained with sorghum + 33% hairy vetch and sorghum + 100% lathyrus, respectively. Forage qualitative traits were also affected by intercropping and weed management. The highest average acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and total ash percentage (ASH) were obtained with 100% sorghum + 66% lathyrus and 33% hairy vetch. The results showed that sorghum intercropping with 33% lathyrus led to a significant reduction in dry matter intake and relative feed value with no weed control and single weed control. This study demonstrated that, by selecting the appropriate intercropping ratios and forage legumes, we could largely control sorghum weeds in addition to improving the quantitative and qualitative yield of sorghum forage.

Effect of population density and sowing date of pumpkin on soil hydrothermal regime, weed control and crop growth in a yam-pumpkin intercrop	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article							"OKRA ABELMOSCHUS-ESCULENTUS; CASSAVA MANIHOT-ESCULENTA; RAINY-SEASON; MAIZE; YIELD; MELON; MOISTURE; TEMPERATURE; MIXTURE; SYSTEMS"	Pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima) is used for live mulch and edible apical shoots, seeds and fruits, and requires that a strategy for using it as ground cover in intercropping with food crops lie developed while sustaining reasonable apical and fruit yields. Field experiments were conducted in 1999-2001 to investigate the effects of population density (5000, 10 000 and 15 000 plants ha(-1)) and sowing date (March, April and May) of pumpkin oil the soil hydrothermal regime, earthworm casts, weed control, and crop growth and yields in a yam-pumpkin intercrop. Growing pumpkin between yam mounds reduced maximum diurnal soil temperature by 4.3-8.1 degrees C, weeding frequency by 52% and weed city biomass by 50-67%, while soil moisture was conserved by 48-62 g kg(-1), earthworm casts were increased by 58-68% and yam tuber yield by 30-52%, irrespective of Population density or sowing date, compared with yam monoculture. Intercropping had no effect oil the growth and fruit yields of pumpkin, but leaf area index and apical shoot and fruit yields increased by 30-49% as the plant population increased to 10 000 plants ha(-1), beyond which there was no further significant increase. Furthermore, apical shoot and fruit yields were remarkably reduced when pumpkin was sown beyond April. Increasing pumpkin population tip to 10 000-15 000 plants ha(-1) reduced soil temperatures by 0.7-1.2 degrees C, weeding frequency by 15-35% and weed dry biomass by 36-57%, conserved soil moisture by 46-63 g kg(-1), and increased earthworm casts by 20% compared to 5000 plants ha(-1) in both cropping systems. Although the sowing date did not affect earthworm casts and weeding frequency, pumpkin sown in March or April reduced soil temperatures by 2.6-4.0 degrees C and weeds by 27%, and conserved soil moisture by 15-37 g kg(-1), compared with May-sown plants. Intercropping pumpkin tip to 10 000 plants ha(-1) with yam at all optimal sowing date target in March-April is recommended for maximum development and productivity, and when pumpkin is used for live mulch in yam plots to reduce supra-optimal soil temperature, excessive evaporation and weed growth.

Effect of Intercropping on Yields of Corn with Different Relative Maturities and Palisadegrass	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							"CROP-LIVESTOCK INTEGRATION; BRACHIARIA-BRIZANTHA; COVER CROPS; GRAIN-YIELD; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; MAIZE; IMPROVEMENT; FERTILIZER; CULTIVARS"	Intercropping corn (Zea mays L.) with palisadegrass [Brachiaria brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich) Stapf] can result in high amounts of residue and improve nutrient cycling. Long-season corn hybrids will live longer, competing with palisadegrass, which may reduce both corn and forage biomass yields. This study, conducted in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, had the objective of evaluating nutrient concentration and yield of corn hybrids with different maturity ratings as affected by intercropped palisadegrass as well as forage dry matter production. The experimental design was randomized blocks with a factorial arrangement of eight treatments consisting of two cropping systems (corn alone and intercropped with palisadegrass) and four corn hybrids (105-, 121-, 132, and 144-d relative maturity). Compared with corn grown alone, intercropping treatments resulted in corn grain yields of 107% (105-d hybrid) to 71.7% (144-d hybrid). In the corn-alone system, the 132-and 144-d corn hybrids provided the highest corn yields (9581 and 9606 kg ha(-1), respectively). Corn yield was similar between the single-crop and intercrop systems when using 105-, 121-, and 132-d hybrids. Intercropping with the 144-d hybrid reduced forage production (6619 kg ha(-1)) and quality of palisadegrass (86 g kg(-1) of crude protein) compared with the other hybrids. The intercropping system with the 132-d hybrid allowed both the highest corn grain (8860 kg ha(-1)) and palisadegrass (8256 kg ha(-1)) yields. Therefore, intercropping palisadegrass with the earlier (105-, 121-, and 132-d) corn hybrids is a viable option for crop-livestock integration because it did not affect either corn or palisadegrass yield.

Strategies to limit (minimize) nitrogen leaching on dairy farms driven by seasonal climate forecasts	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						"ENSO forecast; N leaching; dairy; forage; environment; water pollution"	"NORTH FLORIDA; NUTRITIVE-VALUE; CERES-MAIZE; SOIL-WATER; EL-NINO; MODEL; SYSTEMS; EFFLUENT; YIELD; TECHNOLOGIES"	"Dairy farmers in Florida are required to limit nitrogen leaching into the ground water below 10 mg L-1. Literature shows that nitrogen leaching on a dairy farm varies greatly with forage systems, amount of manure N applied, seasonal rainfall amounts, and soil characteristics. The purpose of this study was to devise dairy-specific strategies for forage crops and manure effluent application rates conditioned to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon that determines El Nino, La Nina, or neutral years, each of which is associated with temperature and rainfall patterns, to reduce N leaching on a typical North Florida dairy farm. The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) was used to simulate N leaching and biomass accumulation using 43 years of daily weather data and eleven forage systems supplied with four levels of manure N (20-160 kg N ha(-1) mo(-1)), and ten soil types where dairies are found. Higher N leaching and lower biomass accumulation occurred in El Nino years than in neutral and La Nina years. N leaching in all ENSO phases was high in winter, particularly in January and February compared to other times in a year. Overall, forage systems with the best potential to limit N leaching were: in the spring (March-May) those that combine bahiagrass or bermudagrass in El Nino years and corn in neutral and La Nina years; in the summer (June-August) those with bahiagrass or bermudagrass in El Nino, bahiagrass, bermudagrass, or corn in neutral, and corn in La Nina years; and in the winter (December-March) those with intercropping of ryegrass, rye, oats, and wheat. This study demonstrates that recommendations for least N leaching can be developed using ENSO phase forecasts. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V."

During the dry season, the share of vetch in the grain yield was 46% lower than in the season of regular rainfall. The share of vetch seeds in the mixture's yield was ca. 21% higher when the mixtures were grown on the S.L. than the H.C. soil. The selection of oats' cultivar for the mixture with vetch affected significantly the thousand seed mass and protein content in the vetch seeds, 46.2-50.4 g and 270-280 g kg(-1), respectively.

Several studies have indicated that intercropping increases phosphorus use efficiency but no overarching analysis exists on the role of species traits and input levels. Here we synthesize the available information on P use efficiency in cereal/legume intercropping. Methods Global data on yields, P uptake and nutrient input in cereal/legume mixtures were extracted from the literature and statistically analyzed. Co-variables explaining P uptake efficiency and yield were considered. Results P uptake was substantially increased with an average value of LERP, the land equivalent ratio for P uptake, of 1.24, and an average NEP (observed P uptake minus expected P uptake) of 3.67 kg P ha(-1). The conversion efficiency of P uptake to biomass decreased with P uptake and was lower in intercrops than in sole crops but the conversion efficiency to yield was not affected by intercropping. The P fertilizer requirement was 21% lower in intercrops than in sole crops for the same yields. Conclusions Substantial improvements in land use efficiency and P uptake are obtained by cereal/legume intercropping. Cereal/legume intercropping has therefore potential to increase P fertilizer use efficiency in agriculture.

Rather, soil nutrient applications for intercropped crops are mainly based on recommended rates for the respective individual crops. A field experiment was conducted at two sites in northwestern Ethiopia to assess the nutrient competition and requirement for finger millet-haricot bean intercropping. Factorial combinations of three cropping systems (sole finger millet, sole haricot bean, and their intercropping) and five fertilizer levels (0, 50%, 100%, 150%, and 200% of the recommended NP fertilizer rate of each sole crop) were laid out in randomized complete block design with three replications. Results revealed that maximum nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) uptake by finger millet and haricot bean were recorded in finger millet-haricot bean intercropping (FM + HB) at 150% and 200% NP, respectively. Greater relative N yield (RNY) than relative dry matter yield (RDMY) was obtained at 150% NP to both component crops indicating that N at this treatment was not limited to both crops in FM + HB. The relative P yield (RPY) was greater than RDMY of finger millet at all but 200% NP, while RPY of haricot bean was less than RDMY at all fertilizer levels. Thus, it can be concluded that FM + HB at 2:1 row ratio and 150% NP increased the nutrient and land use efficiency more than sole cropping.

Pusa hydrogel under assured irrigation (PHLI), organic mulch under assured irrigation (OMAI), aqua-sowing under assured irrigation (ASAI), control under assured irrigation (CAI), Pusa hydrogel under limited irrigation (PHLI), organic mulch under limited irrigation (OMLI), aqua-sowing under limited irrigation (ASLI), and control under limited irrigation (CLI). The maximum plant height (87.2 cm), tillers/m 2 (560) and LAI (5.19) were recorded with OMAI followed by PHAI and ASAI. Wheat grain yield increased by 5.9, 6.7 and 11.4% due to aquasowing, Pusa hydrogel and organic mulch, respectively under assured irrigation. Per cent grain yield improvement under limited irrigation was 13.2, 14.8 and 22.1% owing to aqua-sowing, Pusa hydrogel and organic mulch, respectively. The grain protein content was more under limited irrigation with maximum protein (10.33%) under CLI. Highest consumptive use (430 mm) was recorded under OMAI; however, the maximum water-use efficiency was found with OMLI (11.7 kg/ha-mm) followed by ASLI (11.4 kg/ha-mm). Under limited irrigation, the lowest proline accumulation was recorded under OMLI (9.3 mu g/g fresh weight) while under PHLI and ASLI it was 10.2 and 13.1 mu g/g fresh weight, respectively. Overall, it is highlighted that under limited irrigation, the organic mulching followed by Pusa hydrogel and aqua-sowing can be good options to achieve higher crop and water productivity and nutrient acquisition in wheat under water starved agro-ecosystems."

"This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of spraying of nano-iron chelate on millet-cowpea intercropping with regard to the importance of nano-chelates in improving crop yield and environmental preservation and to achieve sustainable agriculture goals. The experimental design was split based on randomized complete block design with three replications during 2015, at research field of Agriculture and Natural Resources of Bampour, Iran. Spraying of nano-chelated iron at 0, 1, 2 and 3% in two stages of branching and flowering comprising main-plots and 5 cropping systems including; millet sole culture, cowpea sole culture, 100% millet+20% cowpea, 100% millet+40% cowpea and 100% millet+ 60% cowpea. Results indicated that interaction of nano-iron chelate and cropping systems was significant on all studied traits (except leaf number of both crops and LER). Mean comparison revealed that the greatest millet grain yield was obtained from plant sprayed with nano-iron at concentration of 3% and millet sole culture equals to 1021.33 kg ha(-1) and the lowest millet grain yield was obtained from non-sprayed plant and 100% millet+ 20% cowpea equals to 442.83 kg ha(-1). The results of the experiment confirmed that nano-iron chelated was effective on intercropping of millet and cowpea, so that plant sprayed at concentration of 3% had greatest morphological characteristics and yield of the both crops."

Fusarium species are well recognized as the important causal agent of Fusarium root rot, which are often distinct with respect to various factors in different soybean-producing regions around the world. Recently, Fusarium root rot has been frequently reported in Sichuan Province of China, where is unique in its climate and diverse cropping patterns, but it is still unclear about the predominant Fusarium species and their pathogenicity on soybean. In this study, diseased soybean roots were collected from three regions of Sichuan Province during 2014-2015. Based on morphological characteristics and phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region and the translation elongation factor 1-alpha gene, 78 isolates of Fusarium were identified as nine distinct species. Pathogenicity tests showed that seven species of Fusarium were able to infect soybean, but differed in pathogenicity. F. oxysporum, F. equiseti and F. graminearum were the most aggressive species to soybean, whereas F. fujikuroi and F. verticillioides were not pathogenic to soybean. There was a strong positive correlation of the pathogenicity of Fusarium species with seedling emergence and fresh root weight. In addition, the diversity of Fusarium species varied among soybean-growing regions. To our knowledge, this report on population and pathogenicity of Fusarium species, in particular, F. graminearum, associated with soybean root rot in Sichuan Province of southwest China, will be helpful to provide effective control strategies for the disease.

Low temperature and humidity (LTH) stress during soybean maturation in the field promotes pre-harvest mildew, resulting in damage to different organs of soybean fruits to different extents, but relatively little information on the resistance mechanisms in these fruits is available. Therefore, to understand the metabolic responses of soybean fruits to field mold (FM), the metabonomic variations induced by LTH were characterized using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-NMR), and the primary metabolites from the pod, seed coat and cotyledon of pre-harvest soybean were quantified. Analysis of FM-damaged soybean germplasms with different degrees of resistance to FM showed that extracts were dominated by 66 primary metabolites, including amino acids, organic acids and sugars. Each tissue had a characteristic metabolic profile, indicating that the metabolism of proline in the cotyledon, lysine in the seed coat, and sulfur in the pod play important roles in FM resistance. The primary-secondary metabolism interface and its potential contribution to FM resistance was investigated by targeted analyses of secondary metabolites. Both the seed coat and the pod have distinct but nonexclusive metabolic responses to FM, and these are functionally integrated into FM resistance mechanisms.

Panar intercropped with Lablab bean (Lablab purpureus L. Sweet) in an adverse conditions of soil and irrigation water. The chemical fertilizers applied were 50 kg/ha of urea (46% N), 50kg/ha of triple superphosphate (46% P), 50 kg/ha of KNO3, 50kg/ha of NPK (20:20:40) in additition to the control. Panar and Lablab bean were sown as a pure stand and as a mixture. Treatments were laid out in a split plot design with the fertilizer treatments in the main plots and the intercropping treatments in the subplots. Parameters measured were plant height and nutritive value for the Panar, fresh and dry yields and the Land Equivalent Ratio (LER). The chemical fertilizers had no significant effects (P <= 0.05) on productivity but significantly improved forage quality in terms of CP and nutrients contents.. Intercropping of Panar and Lablab significantly (P <= 0.05) increased forage productivity and improved forage quality. Lablab bean was not a good competitor as it disappeared following the first cut.

We hypothesize that intercropping can be used as an alternative pest management strategy to reduce aphid yield loss in fennel. Thus, we investigated the severity of fennel plant damage in relation to infestation by the fennel aphid and predation by Cycloneda sanguinea (L.) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae)(spotless lady beetle), green lacewing, Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae), and Scymnus spp. (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in sole fennel plots and plots of fennel intercropped with cotton with colored fibers. The fennel aphid populations in nontreated plots were significantly larger in sole fennel plots than in intercropped plots. The highest densities of C. sanguinea, green lacewings and Scymnus spp., associated with the suppression of fennel aphid populations was found in fennel in the intercropping systems. Fennel aphids reduced the fennel seed yield by 80% in the sole fennel plots compared with approximate to 30% for all intercropping systems. The results obtained in this research are of practical significance for designing appropriate strategies for fennel aphid control in fennel-cotton intercropping systems. In summary, intercropping fennel with cotton with colored fibers apparently promoted biocontrol of fennel aphid in fennel.	"[Ramalho, F. S.; Fernandes, F. S.; Nascimento, A. R.

The current study investigates the severity of plant damage related to infestation by the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover (Hemiptera: Heteroptera: Aphididae) and its predation by spotless ladybird beetle, Cycloneda sanguinea (L.) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and green lacewing, Chnisoperla carnea (Stephens) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) and parasitism by Lysiphlebus testaceipes (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Aphidiidae) in sole cotton plots and in plots of cotton intercropped with fennel. Cotton aphid populations were significantly higher in sole cotton plots than in intercropping plots for plots that were not treated with insecticide. The percentages of losses in cotton seed yield were higher in the sole cotton plots than in the four intercropping systems (one row of cotton for two rows of fennel, one row of cotton for three rows of fennel, two rows of cotton for one row of fennel, and three rows of cotton for two rows of fennel). The losses in cotton seed yield were significantly lower in the intercropping system with three rows of cotton interspersed with two rows of fennel than in the other intercropping systems. Spotless ladybird beetle and green lacewing densities were significantly higher in the intercropping system with three rows of cotton interspersed with two rows of fennel than in the other intercropping systems. These results are of practical significance in designing appropriate strategies for cotton aphid control in cotton-fennel intercropping systems.	"[Ramalho, F. S.; Fernandes, F. S.; Nascimento, A. R.

The main objective of this study was to determine the aboveground biomass yield and interspecific competitiveness in an intercropping system of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L) with corn (lea mays L). A 3-year (2007-2009) field experiment was conducted, including four intercropping patterns by alternating alfalfa and corn row ratios of 2:2, 3:1 4:2 and 5:2. Mono-cultured corn and alfalfa were used as the control. The biomass yield of alfalfa was measured at early blooming, whereas that of corn was at physiological maturity. Competitiveness indices examined were land equivalent ratio (LER), aggressivity (A), relative crowding coefficient (K values) and competitive ratio (CR). The biomass yields of mono-cultured alfalfa and all intercropping patterns increased each year. In all years, the 5:2 intercropping pattern always displayed a biomass yield advantage based on greater LER values. Alfalfa had higher relative crowding coefficients (K values), CR, and A values than corn. The intercropping of alfalfa with corn had yield advantages compared to alfalfa or corn monoculture. The intercropping pattern of 5:2 (alfalfa:corn row ratio) was an optimal pattern in our study. Alfalfa was the superior competitor when grown with corn, and its productivity dominated the total biomass yields. Thus, intercropping of alfalfa with corn has the potential to improve performance with high land-use efficiency. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to investigate the changes of ash percentage, important elements and solar radiation absorption of three cultivars of berseem clover as cover crops intercropped with forage corn in different levels of nitrogen starter fertilizer, an experiment was conducted in 2010, at Research Farm, Faculty of Agriculture, Islamic Azad University, Khorasgan Branch (Isfahan). A factorial layout within randomized complete block design with 3 replications was used. Cultivars were Karaj, Sacromont and Multicut, and nitrogen levels included 0, 40 and 60 kg/ha. The nitrogen fertilizer was provided from urea source (46% pure N). Cultivar had significant effect on ash percentage and solar radiation absorption. The effect of nitrogen also was significant on ash percentage, Fe content, Mn content and solar radiation absorption. Ash percentage, Fe content, solar radiation absorption and light transmission were significantly influenced by interaction between cultivar and nitrogen. The highest ash percentage, Fe and Zn content were related to Sacromont. The maximum Mn content, Cu content and light transmission were obtained by Multicut. The maximum solar radiation absorption was related to Karaj. The nutritive value of berseem clover was influenced by changes in different levels of nitrogen starter fertilizer. The highest ash percentage, Mn content, Cu content and light transmission was obtained by application of 40 kg N/ha. The maximum Zn content was related to application of 60 kg N/ha. Control treatment had the maximum Fe content and solar radiation absorption.

Using Different Planting Patterns	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES-TARIM BILIMLERI DERGISI			English	Article						"competition indices; cotton; cowpea; sorghum; intercropping; planting pattern"	"COMMON VETCH; BARLEY; RATIO; OAT"	The study reports comparative bioeconomic efficiency of different cotton based intercropping systems using high yielding cotton cv. NIAB 78 of Pakistan in 80 cm spaced rows and 120/40 cm spaced rows with cowpea and sorghum as intercrops. Land equivalent ratio showed 32-46 % advantage over sole cropping in both planting patterns. Values of Area time equivalent ratio showed 5-13 % advantage in cotton+cowpea and 9-23 % disadvantage in cotton+sorghum intercropping. Agressivity and competitive ratio showed dominancy of cotton over intercrops while intercrops were more dominant than cotton in actual yield loss values. Values of AYL showed an advantage of 32.1 % to 116.3 % from intercropping due to recovery made by intercrops. Intercropping advantage values showed intercropping disadvantage (-3.865 to -151.035) from intercropping due to price diffference of the component crop which meant that intercrops failed to compensate. Monetary advantage index values were also positive showing a definite yield advantage. Intercropping with cowpea reduced the yield of cotton, however, it seemed more appropriate for intercropping with cotton in both 80 cm and 120/40 cm spaced rows.. 120/40 cm spaced rows spacing seemed better compared to single row spacing for easy handling of intercrops and sole cotton, therefore, it is recommended for mechanical farming in Pakistan.

The model has the capacity to simulate the growth of individual root sections in response to the supply and demand for water and nitrate. N mineralisation was not modelled explicitly, but was accounted for through the use of a seasonally variable mineralisation input derived from the field data. Simulated nitrogen and water contents and root length densities in the soil profile agreed well with observed profiles, although all were slightly under-predicted. A sensitivity analysis revealed that model predictions were most sensitive to the drained upper limit values (v/v) and the mineralisation rates (mugN m(-3) s(-1)) incorporated as external inputs to the model, along with the unit rate of N-2 fixation (mol nodule(-1) s(-1)) and unit root growth rates (mum mol(-1) s(-1)) which are physiological parameters previously calibrated for lupins, The amount of nitrate leached was predicted well. Spatial plots of nitrate leaching were a close inverse of the root length density plots, with the highest nitrate leaching below the inter-plant zones, and the least nitrate leaching directly below each plant. These results suggest that the root distribution of a legume species such as lupin can have an effect on the leaching of nitrate to depth. It may thus be possible to reduce the total amount of nitrate leached under lupin crops by investigating factors such as the spatial deployment of roots, planting densities and intercropping.

Bieb.) intercropping system provides ecological services, but competition for water between the grain crop and the living mulch crop often reduces corn yields. Our objectives were to determine (i) if corn that performs well under managed drought (i.e., drought-tolerant corn) can minimize the grain yield losses incurred when corn is intercropped with kura clover, and (ii) if strong suppression of the kura clover living mulch minimizes the loss in yield of drought-tolerant and drought-susceptible corn. From drought trials in Minnesota in 2009 and 2010, we identified five drought-tolerant and five drought-susceptible hybrids from the intermated B73 X Mo17 population. Under drought conditions, mean grain yields were 9.66 Mg ha(-1) for the drought-tolerant hybrids and 5.46 Mg ha(-1) for the drought-susceptible hybrids. The 10 hybrids were evaluated in Minnesota and Wisconsin in 2011 in a kura clover intercropping system. Drought-tolerant hybrids had statistically equal mean yields of 12.90 Mg ha(-1) in the killed mulch treatment and 13.69 Mg ha(-1) in the living mulch treatment. In contrast, mean yields of drought-susceptible hybrids were significantly reduced from 4.53 Mg ha(-1) in the killed mulch treatment to 3.48 Mg ha(-1) in the living mulch treatment. For the drought-tolerant hybrids, mulch recovery at corn harvest was significantly lower with killed kura clover (41%) than with living kura clover (50%). Our results indicate that the yield of drought-tolerant corn was not reduced by growing in a living mulch of kura clover.

The results indicated that intercrops reduced the densities of T. urticae eggs and mobile forms on the vegetative growth, the flowering, and the bean expansion stages of green bean plants compared with sole crop. In this study, seven predators of T. urticae including Stethorus gilvifrons (Mulsant), Orius niger (Wolff), Neoseiulus zwoelferi (Dosse), Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens), Geocoris punctipes (Say), Scolothrips sexmaculatus Pergande, and Nabis pseudoferus (Remane) were collected on TSSM-infested green bean plants during the two growing seasons. Among them, S. gilvifrons and O. niger were the main predators of TSSM on green bean plants in the two growing seasons. Furthermore, the densities of O. niger were significantly higher in intercrops on the vegetative growth and the flowering stages of green bean compared with sole crop, whereas no significant difference was observed in the densities of S. gilvifrons between intercrops and sole crop in 2017 and 2018. Moreover, the values of the Shannon diversity index (H ') and Pielou's evenness index (J ') for the composition of TSSM predators were greater in the three intercrops compared with sole crop for the entire growing seasons 2017/2018. On the other hand, the land equivalent ratio (LER), which is used to assess the yield benefit in intercrops, was greater than one in intercrops, especially in the 3GB:5G ratio (1.29 in 2017 and 1.40 in 2018). These results indicated that strip intercropping green bean with garlic could be effective in the control of T. urticae in green bean fields.

The evaporation and radiation interception using the neighboring species model (ERIN) can effectively estimate evapotranspiration (ET) in a different intercropping ecosystem. However, the effects of soil surface resistance in the mulching area on ET are not considered in the ERIN model. Thus, the existing ET models do not accurately estimate ET in the intercropping ecosystem with PFM. In this study, we proposed a modified ERIN model (MERIN). In the MERIN model, soil surface resistance in the mulching area was taken into account, and its performance was compared to ERIN and Penman-Monteith (PM) models. These models were validated against observed ET and E using the water balance method and micro-lysimeters in a corn intercropped tomato experiment under high (HI: 30 mm for corn and 22.5 mm for tomato, a locally recommended irrigation depth), medium (MI: 22.5 mm for corn and 16.9 mm for tomato, 25% of HI), and low irrigation depth (LI: 15 mm for corn and 11.25 mm for tomato, 50% of HI) during 2018-2019, respectively. The outcomes of this study showed that the MERIN model could accurately estimate ET and E variation for a corn-tomato intercropping ecosystem under PFM during the entire crop growth season compared to the other examined models. The most intense water competition between corn and tomato was observed in stage II (the elongation and tasseling stages for corn; the flowering and fruiting stages for tomato). T of corn generally was higher than tomato, but an opposite result was also observed in stage II. Additionally, the variation of water competition under different irrigation levels was similar in the intercropping ecosystem. When irrigation depth decreased to 22.5 and 15 mm from 30 mm, average T for corn decreased by 10.7% and 16.3%, respectively, and by 12.9% and 22.4% for tomato, respectively, in both years."

Understanding and optimizing species mixtures using functional-structural plant modelling	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY			English	Review						"Complementarity; diversity; phenotypic plasticity; resource foraging; simulation model; virtual plant"	"FAR-RED RATIO; LIGHT INTERCEPTION; CULTIVAR MIXTURES; WHEAT; ARCHITECTURE; PRODUCTIVITY; INTERCROPS; PLASTICITY; DIVERSITY; SYSTEMS"	Plant species mixtures improve productivity over monocultures by exploiting species complementarities for resource capture in time and space. Complementarity results in part from competition avoidance responses that maximize resource capture and growth of individual plants. Individual organs accommodate to local resource levels, e.g. with regard to nitrogen content and photosynthetic capacity or by size (e.g. shade avoidance). As a result, the resource acquisition in time and space is improved and performance of the community as a whole is increased. Modelling is needed to unravel the primary drivers and subsequent dynamics of complementary growth responses in mixtures. Here, we advocate using functional-structural plant (FSP) modelling to analyse the functioning of plant mixtures. In FSP modelling, crop performance is a result of the behaviour of the individual plants interacting through competitive and complementary resource acquisition. FSP models can integrate the interactions between structural and physiological plant responses to the local resource availability and strength of competition, which drive resource capture and growth of individuals in species mixtures. FSP models have the potential to accelerate mixed-species plant research, and thus support the development of knowledge that is needed to promote the use of mixtures towards sustainably increasing crop yields at acceptable input levels.

Thus, the objective was to evaluate the effect of inoculating or not inoculating Azospirillum brasilense on corn and palisade grass seeds (Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu) on growth, yield components, and dry matter yield of the aerial part and grains in an Oxisol cropped in ICLS and under a no-tillage system for 12 years in an irrigated area. The experimental design was a randomized block design with four replications. The treatments were composed of corn (monoculture) with inoculated seed, corn (monoculture) without inoculated seed, corn + palisade grass (intercropping) without inoculation, corn + palisade grass (intercropping) with inoculation in both seeds, corn + palisade grass (intercropping) with inoculation of corn seeds, and corn + palisade grass (intercropping) with inoculation of grass seeds. At the end of each production cycle, the yield and components of corn, corn straw biomass, and dry matter of palisade grass were evaluated. Considering the optimal conditions of soil provided by liming and fertilization at sowing and nitrogen applied in topdressing, the application of A. brasilense in corn seeds did not show its potential. Intercropped systems inoculated or not with A. brasilense on corn seeds increase grain yield, dry matter production of grass, and nutrient accumulation in the straw, providing greater sustainability to the Cerrado no-tillage system.

The objective of this study was to determine how microenvironment, morphology, productivity and quality of jalapeno peppers were affected by corn intercropping and the use of plastic mulching. Two experiments were conducted during 2015 and 2016 in the Valley of Mexicali, Mexico, a region characterized by its extreme aridity, soil salinity, hot temperatures and high radiation during the summer. Four treatments were tested: jalapeno peppers grown on bare soil (BS); on bare soil intercropped with corn (BS+IC); on plastic mulch (PMu); and on plastic mulch intercropped with corn (PMu+IC). The response variables measured were yield, fruit quality attributes, microclimatic variables, and morphology of the pepper crop. PMu treatment produced the tallest pepper plants and yields, while the BS+IC treatment produced the smallest plants and the lowest yields. A possible explanation for the higher biomass and crop yield of the PMu treatment is the lack of competition from corn and the effect of plastic mulching in reducing soil salinity. It is concluded that competition from corn on jalapeno pepper dramatically affected the pepper's productivity, particularly under high soil salinity and extremely high temperature conditions."

The yield of cassava cultivated in the alleys of these legumes was also evaluated. Gtiricidia was planted by cuttings in 1994, and leucaena was planted by seedlings in 1995, in rows of 3 m apart. At periods of three to five months, cuts were carried on and the shoot biomass was incorporated to the soil. Stems with diameter higher than I cm were not considered in the biomass weight. The dry matter obtained in these cuts was expressed in ton ha(-1) year(-1). In 1998, soil samples were taken to quantify some soil chemical and physical properties, Soil samples from a neighbor area were used as control. Leucaena and gliricidia. yield were, respectively, 4.87 and 5.80 ton ha(-1) year(-1) of shoot dry matter. Gliricidia showed a lesser competition to cassava in the interrows. The incorporation of shoot biomass of both legumes to the soil caused an increment in the values of pH and Ca+Mg, but has not affected organic matter content and CEC. Decreases of the soil density and increases of the porosity were also observed in response to legume incorporation. These effects were most noticeable in the superficial layers.

The presence of associated plants in the intercrop can lead to attack escape in three ways, all involving lower population growth rate of the attacking organism. In one, the associates cause plants of the attacked component to be less good hosts; in the second, they interfere directly with activities of the attacker; and in the third, they change the environment in the intercrop so that natural enemies of the attacker are favoured. Several mechanisms combine to allow multilines and variety mixtures to provide durable protection of cereal crops against specialised, fungal pathogens. Similar approaches may control insects, insect-borne viral pathogens and nematodes. Greater activity of natural enemies of pests in intercrops can control some insect pests and possibly at least one soil pathogen. Although few studies have linked observed changes in populations of the attacking organisms with yield loss, three principles are proposed to explain yield responses of intercrops to attack. The productivity of an attacked component may be increased several-fold through intercropping. The effect of attack on the land equivalent ratio (LER) is positive where escape occurs, especially if two or more components each escape from their own specific attacker. Use of symptomless carriers of disease can lead to low LERs. Under some conditions, intercropping can usefully contribute to the control of pest or disease populations and the reduction of yield loss. Models of the interaction between cropping systems and their attacking organisms may sometimes clarify issues in a way that many incomplete and short-term experiments fail to do. To overcome the difficulties of experimentation in this complex field, institutional cooperation seems essential."

Two soybean varieties, Nandou 12 (shade resistant), and Nan 032-4 (shade susceptible), were tested. Our results revealed that under shading, the net assimilation rate and the plant growth were significantly reduced. However, foliar application of Si under normal light and shading significantly improved the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs), transpiration rate (Tr), and decreased intercellular carbon dioxide concentration (Ci). The net photosynthetic rate of Nandou 12 under normal light and shading increased by 46.4% and 33.3% respectively with Si treatment (200 mg/kg) compared to controls. Si application also enhanced chlorophyll content, soluble sugars, fresh weight, root length, root surface area, root volume, root-shoot ratio, and root dry weight under both conditions. Si application significantly increased the accumulation of some carbohydrates such as soluble sugar and sucrose in stems and leaves ensuring better stem strength under both conditions. Si application significantly increased the yield by increasing the number of effective pods per plant, the number of beans per plant and the weight of beans per plant. After Si treatment, the yield increased 24.5% under mono-cropping, and 17.41% under intercropping. Thus, Si is very effective in alleviating the stress effects of shading in intercropped soybeans by increasing the photosynthetic efficiency and lodging resistance.

The Si accumulation in different parts of the plants, the photosynthetic parameters of leaves and chlorophyll content, the stem bending resistance, the expression of genes of lignin biosynthesis and associated enzyme activity and sap flow rates were measured at early and late growth stages. The potential mechanisms for how Si improve growth and shade tolerance, enhances lodging resistance and improves photosynthesis were analyzed to provide a theoretical basis for the use of Si amendments in agriculture. After application of Si at 200 mg kg(-1), the net photosynthetic rate of soybeans increased by 46.4 0/0 in the light and 33.3 % under shade. The application of Si increased chlorophyll content, and fresh weight of leaves, reduced leaf area and enhanced photosynthesis by increasing stomatal conductance. The activity of peroxidase (POD), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL), cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) increased during pre-and post-growth periods, whereas Si also increased ligninaccumulation and inhibited lodging. We concluded that Si affects the composition of plant cell walls components, mostly by altering linkages of non-cellulosic polymers and lignin. The modifications of the cell wall network through Si application could be a useful strategy to reduce shading stress in intercropping.

Soybean seedlings were grown in pots and exposed to no shade (S0), slight shade (S1), moderate shade (S2), and heavy shade (S3). Our findings showed that under the S3 in both cultivars, leaf fresh weight (LFW), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf thickness decreased significantly, accompanied by a reduction in photochemical parameters including the maximum quantum yield (F root F-m) and electron transport rate (ETR). Furthermore, compared to S0, S1 significantly increased the ETR, sucrose content and the activity of catalase (CAT) in both D16 and E93 cultivars while S2 and S3 decreased the activity. However, under all treatments of shading stress, the antioxidant activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) were lowered in both cultivars. Such morphological and physiological plasticity to adapt S1 compensates for the decrease in biomass and leads to seed weight compared to that obtained with an amount of normal light. Through configuring the space in the intercropping systems, S1 could be helpful for optimum growth and yield. Redesigning photosynthesis through S1 for the intercropping systems could be a smart approach.

We explored the effects of shade intensity on lignin biosynthesis and lodging resistance at the physiological and molecular levels in two soybean cultivars (Nandou12 and E93) with different shade tolerance under four progressively severe shade treatments, S0-S3 (S0: no shade, S1: slight shade, S2: moderate shade, S3: heavy shade). Our results showed no significant difference in breaking strength of the two cultivars under S1 and S0 treatments, with no prominent decrease in the lodging resistance index. The activity of lignin biosynthesis rate-limiting enzymes phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), peroxidase and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), which were considerably related to the two lodging resistance indexes above, was not significantly decreased by slight shade, while 4-coumaric acid ligase (4CL) activity was increased. Most genes involved in lignin biosynthesis were not significantly down-regulated by slight shade (S1) compared to S0, while p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase (C3H), 4-coumaric acid ligase (4CL) and laccase (LAC) genes were upregulated. Under heavy shade (S3), enzyme activity and gene expression associated with lignin synthesis in both soybean cultivars were strongly inhibited; moreover, stem mechanical strength and lodging resistance were remarkably decreased compared with those under S0. These physiological and molecular changes suggested that applicable shade levels do not significantly affect the mechanical strength and lodging resistance of soybean stem. Exploiting the lodging resistance potential of existing soybean cultivars was an effective and efficient way to address yield reduction caused by lodging in intercropped soybeans."

AMF inoculation significantly increased (+13.6%) forage dry biomass and durum wheat nitrogen (+22.8%) and phosphorus (+32.5%) uptake. AMF inoculation, significantly promoted broad bean phosphorus uptake (+11.5%) and root nodule number (+13.9%) in the absence of OMW. OMW spreading reduced weeds in the forage (-31.3%), root nodule number (-29.7%) and dry weight (-22.7%) in broad bean. OMW also significantly increased snail medick dry biomass (+19.3%) as compared to control treatments (0, 40 and 80 m(3) H2O ha(-1), average production 361 g m(-2)), and broad bean grain yield with a production of 2.46 +/- 0.12 and 1.94 +/- 0.09 Mg ha(-1) with and without OMW, respectively. During the experiment AMF colonization was not affected by OMW volumes. The results obtained showed that in a marginal Mediterranean agro-ecosystem: 1) OMW, notwithstanding spreading volumes, is a valuable amendment to maximize legume yield while 2) AMF inoculation is a valuable practice to improve biomass production and N and P uptake in wheat.

Lignin accumulation, transcripts of genes involved in lignin biosynthesis, and intermediates content of lignin biosynthesis were analyzed. Both soybean varieties suffered shade stress had increased plant heights and internode lengths, and reduced stem diameters and lignin accumulation in stems. The expression levels of lignin-related genes were significantly influenced by shade stress, with interactions between the light environment and variety. The gene of 3-hydroxylase (C3H), cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (OCR), caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT), and peroxidase (POD) attributed to lignin biosynthesis under shade stress, and the down-regulation of these genes resulted in lower caffeic, sinapic, and ferulic acid levels, which caused a further decrease in lignin biosynthesis. Under shade stress, the shade tolerant soybean variety (Nandou 12) showed stiffer stems, higher lignin content, and greater gene expression level and higher metabolite contents than shade susceptible one. So these characteristics could be used for screening the shade-tolerant soybean for intercropping.

We conducted an experiment from 2002 through 2006 comparing yield, quality, and water and N use of durum and three annual forages, barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), barley interseeded with pea [Piston sativum L. ssp. arvense (L.) Poir.], and foxtail millet [Setaria italica (L.) Beau.] in 2-yr rotations. Durum in rotation with summer fallow and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) were included. Averaged over 5 yr, alfalfa had higher forage yield and quality, water use, and N accumulation compared to annual forages. Annual forages had similar preplant and postharvest soil water contents, but barley and barley-pea had higher yields and water use compared to millet. Barley-pea intercrop had superior forage crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and N accumulation compared to barley and millet, but acid detergent fiber (ADP) and nitrogen recovery index (NRI) were similar among annual forages. Averaged over 4 yr, preplant soil water and residual N content were greater for durum following fallow than for durum following annual forages, resulting in reduced fertilizer N requirement and greater yield, water use, grain N accumulation and NRI following fallow. Replacing summer fallow with annual forages reduced durum grain yield by 727 kg ha(-1) but provided forage yield of 4.9 Mg ha(-1). Annualized net returns in annual forage-durum systems were $127 ha(-1), $77 and $34 ha(-1) greater than for fallow-durum and alfalfa, respectively. Replacing summer fallow with annual forages reduced durum yield but improved profitability,.	"[Lenssen, A. W.; Sainju, U. M.] ARS, USDA, No Plains Agr Res Lab, Sidney, MT 59270 USA; [Cash, S.

We investigated ways of reducing this risk by removing portions of a lucerne pasture, using either herbicides or cultivation, at monthly intervals between November and April, before sowing a wheat crop in May, followed by a canola crop in the following year. The experimental site was on a red-brown earth in southern New South Wales. Lucerne removal was incomplete when the wheat was sown, so all lucerne plants were removed from half of each plot with a post-emergence herbicide, to allow comparisons of intercropped wheat-lucerne and wheat monoculture. Measurements were made on crop growth, yield, grain quality, soil water, and soil mineral nitrogen (N) before and after both crops. On average, each additional month between lucerne removal and wheat sowing led to a yield increase of 8% and a grain protein increase of 0.3 percentage units. The main reason for the increases was additional soil mineral N, associated with a longer period of mineralisation. The soil water content at the time of wheat sowing was greater with early lucerne removal but the growing season rainfall did not limit yields, and there was more residual soil water at the time of wheat maturity where lucerne had been removed late and yields were lower. Method of lucerne removal did not significantly affect wheat yield, grain protein, soil water, or soil mineral N. The portions of the plots containing lucerne plants that survived the initial removal attempt produced similar wheat yields to the portions where lucerne had been totally removed, but grain protein was lower. The following growing season was drier, but despite less residual soil water where lucerne had been removed earlier in the previous year, the average canola yield was 2.5% greater for each additional month of fallow. The increase again appeared to be due to more residual mineral N. The seed oil concentration also decreased in response to later lucerne removal but seed protein increased. Where lucerne plants had been retained in the previous wheat crop, canola yield was lower than where they had been totally removed, apparently because of less soil water at sowing. Over the 2 years of the experiment, the net supply of mineral N was 374 kg N/ha, equivalent to an annual net mineralisation of 2% of the total soil N. The initial mineralisation rate was slow, suggesting that the soil may be deficient in mineral N soon after lucerne removal.

Disease dynamics and dispersal are represented by a spatial, single pathotype version of Gumpert's (1992) model that simulated the temporal evolution of a number of pathotypes on a cultivar mixture. Spore dispersal occurs by discrete rules between a cell and its four orthogonal neighbours in a rectangular grid. Parameters termed transmission efficiency rates control the extent of successful inoculum exchange between two neighbouring cells depending on the cultivars present. Spatially averaged disease progress curves are computed for regular block and strip patterns in addition to the mean curve for twenty 1:1 random mixture patterns. These sets of curves are exhibited relative to the appropriate pure stand comparison for a range of auto- and cross-deposition parameters. We conducted simulations for uniform initial infection and also averaged over 20 random initial infection patterns at a comparable mean level. In the former case, provided the ratio of cross-deposition to auto-deposition is high enough and the disease progress curves take sufficiently long to reach their saturation value, the ranking of the geometrical patterns can eventually be interpreted once initial oscillations have subsided. The geometry with the largest proportion of links between neighbouring cells of different cultivar type generally corresponds to the lowest average disease level, but not for averaged simulations based on random initial infection patterns.

Previous studies suggested that three ER homologs, ER, ERECTA-LIKE 1 (ERL1) and ERECTA-LIKE 2 (ERL2) are in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana. But little is known about the copy numbers and the biological functions of ER homologs in other plant species, especially in crops. Here we identified four ER homologs in soybean (Glycine max) by the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) with Arabidopsis ER sequences. Four ER paralogs, GmERa (Glyma04g05912), GmERb (Glyma06g05900), GmERc (Glyma14g11220) and GmERd (Glyma17g34380) were predicted to be located on different chromosomes of soybean. Organ-specific expression analyses indicated high transcript levels of soybean ER homologs in hypocotyls, petioles, stems and leaves, while the levels in roots and cotyledons were relatively low. Real-time quantitative PCR and ER promoter::GUS analyses showed that the four GmER genes were differentially induced by the dehydration stress. These results suggest that four soybean ER paralogs might play distinct roles in different plant tissues and function differentially after the water stress. Among them, GmERb is expressed in almost all tissues and could be induced to the highest level by the dehydration stress.

One key pathway for such agroecological intensification is the diversification of cropping systems using intercropping and notably cereal-grain legume mixtures. Such mixtures or intercrops have the potential to increase and stabilize yields and improve cereal grain protein concentration in comparison to sole crops. Species mixtures are complex and the 4C approach is both a pedagogical and scientific way to represent the combination of four joint effects of Competition, Complementarity, Cooperation, and Compensation as processes or effects occurring simultaneously and dynamically between species over the whole cropping cycle. Competition is when plants have fairly similar requirements for abiotic resources in space and time, the result of all processes that occur when one species has a greater ability to use limiting resources (e.g., nutrients, water, space, light) than others. Complementarity is when plants grown together have different requirements for abiotic resources in space, time or form. Cooperation is when the modification of the environment by one species is beneficial to the other(s). Compensation is when the failure of one species is compensated by the other(s) because they differ in their sensitivity to abiotic stress. The 4C approach allows to assess the performance of arable intercropping versus classical sole cropping through understanding the use of abiotic resources. (C) The Author(s) 2021.

In addition, difficulties in marketing the produce are emphasised. The question thus arises if and how such strategies can be designed to find a place in modern agriculture. Considering the general ecological benefits of diversification and the possible economical benefits for growers and society, several possible approaches to the solution of actual and perceived problems in modern agriculture are discussed. An important route towards achieving diversity would be to integrate it into the breeding process. Selection criteria would include inducibility of resistance and competitive ability, in order to produce diversified varieties able to adapt both to unpredictable environmental conditions (especially climatic) and to changing pest and pathogen populations through co-evolution. Evolutionary breeding methods such as composite crosses and modern landraces and some of the legal problems associated with these approaches are discussed. Technical solutions are integral to the future use of diversification strategies and range from more or less simple adjustments to machinery for planting and harvesting to devices designed for separation of the harvested products.

Co-design workshops allow multiple scenarios to be explored without risks. They favor identification of consistent answers to complex problems, considering local conditions and constraints. OBJECTIVE: We present Interplay, the serious game we created to support players' exploration of intercrops by designing a wide-range of cereal-legume intercropping scenarios in given cropping system contexts and assessing eight ecosystem services provided by intercrops, i.e., intercropped cereal and legume yields, cereal protein content, nitrogen supply to the following crop, impact on soil structure and weed, insect and disease control.METHODS: Interplay aims at being used with groups of farmers and their advisor or students and their agronomy teacher. The game includes a game board and cards to design intercropping scenarios defined by: (i) the cropping system and field context; (ii) the farmers' objectives when introducing an intercrop; (iii) the species to associate and (iv) the crop management. A computer model assesses the ecosystem services provided by the intercropping scenario designed on the game board. The players compare these results to their objectives and to sole crop performances and, if necessary, adjust the scenarios. The players are guided through the design process by a facilitator.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, we used the game with 70 French agriculture students divided into six groups to design intercropping scenarios improving nitrogen supply to the following crop in a rotation. Students designed scenarios that improved nitrogen supply compared to the initial sole crop, yet cereal yield decreased more than the farmer desired. Guided by the facilitator, students reconsidered the cropping system to improve nitrogen supply at the crop rotation level. Interplay is an interactive tool used to stimulate players' creativity by exploring intercropping scenarios and providing salient, credible and legitimate assessment of the ecosystem services provided. It also promotes knowledge sharing on intercropping and allows redesigning the cropping system completely. Students and teachers who used it declared that it helped enhance their knowledge on intercrops.SIGNIFICANCE: Interplay is the first serious game suited to develop the practice of intercropping. It is currently available for cereal-grain legume intercrops sown simultaneously in a random pattern under French soil-climate conditions, but could be adapted to other countries and intercrops."

Generally, intercropping of gramineous grass and leguminous grass can achieve high productivity. However, how different water availability levels affect the productivity of intercropping system remains unclear. Here, we conducted a 3-year (2015-2017) study by manipulating the water conditions (CK equivalent to the annual precipitation, +50% treatment equivalent to 50% increase over the average precipitation, and -50% treatment equivalent to 50% decrease over the average precipitation) to explore the responses of plant traits, nitrogen use efficiency, and biomass of the monoculture of Medicago sativa (a leguminous grass, M.s), monoculture of Elymus nutans (a gramineous grass, E.n), and intercropping of M.s and E.n in a semi-arid region in Inner Mongolia, China. The results showed that the biomass obtained by intercropping of M.s and E.n decreased by 24.4% in -50% treatment compared to the CK treatment, while that of the monoculture of M.s decreased by 34.4% under the -50% treatment compared to the CK treatment. However, there was no significant difference in the biomass between intercropping artificial grassland and monoculture M. sativa under +50% treatment. Compared to monoculture, M.s can obtain more nitrogen by biological nitrogen fixation and decrease the proportion of nitrogen absorbed from soils under intercropping in the same water conditions. Under the intercropping system, the proportions of nitrogen absorbed from soils by M.s were 87.4%, 85.1, and 76.9% in -50%, CK, and +50% treatments, respectively. Under monoculture, these proportions were 91.9, 89.3, and 82.3% in -50%, CK, and +50% treatments, respectively. Plant trait, but not soil nitrogen content, was the main regulator for the productivity responses to water level changes. Our results highlight that intercropping can achieve higher productivity in both dry and wet conditions. Therefore, considering the fluctuating rainfall events in the future, it might be useful to alter the proportions of intercropped forage species in an artificial grassland to obtain optimal productivity by reducing the limitations of nitrogen availability. However, the economic viability of intercropping M. sativa and E. nutans should be evaluated in the future.

A field experiment was conducted in two growing seasons (2017 and 2018) to determine optimal intercropping patterns of ajowan (Trachyspermum ammi L.) and fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) to increase yield and quality of the ajowan and to improve soil properties. The treatments evaluated in this study were sole cropping of ajowan (A) and fenugreek (F), replacement intercropping series of A:F (1:1, 4:4, 3:1, and 1:3 ratios) and additive intercropping series of A:F (100:12.5, 100:25, 100:37.5, 100:50, 100:62.5, 100:75, and 100:87.5 ratios). The results showed that the highest biological yield (4172.7 kg ha(-1)), seed yield (1009.7 kg ha(-1)), and essential oil yield (42.0 kg ha(-1)) of ajowan were obtained in the additive pattern A:F 100:25. The highest concentrations of thymol and gamma-terpinene, the major chemical components of ajowan essential oil, were recorded for the A:F 100:25 intercropping pattern. Total LER and ATER indices were above one in all of the intercropping patterns. The concentrations of soil total organic carbon (TOC) and nitrogen (TON), available forms of NO3- and NH4+, Mg2+, K+, as well as basal respiration (BR) and substrate-induced respiration (SIR) in the A:F 100:25 intercropping pattern were greater than for the fenugreek and ajowan sole crops. Overall, the analysis showed that the A:F 100:25 additive intercropping pattern had positive and strong effects in terms of increased yield and quality of ajowan and improvement of soil fertility.

Service crops can be intercropped with cash crops to facilitate interactions between crops and to optimize the use of the cropping season. Many terms exist to describe these practices, which highlights their diversity. However, this diversity of terms may be a source of confusion. Here, we present an overview of the current uses of intercropped service plants in temperate cropping systems, with the main services they provide and their management. (1) First, we show that a limited range of service crop species, mostly from the Fabaceae family, have been studied to date. This finding suggests that the diversity of species and cultivar resources that can be used as service crops has been poorly explored in the literature. In contrast, the combinations of service and cash crops tested appear wider. We address this diversity by defining synchronous intercropping, living mulch and relay intercropping. (2) Then, we show that intercropped service crops can efficiently reduce weed biomass and pest attacks and improve nitrogen cycling, thereby increasing soil fertility and improving crop nutrition. The intensity of these services is positively associated with service crop biomass, but excessive service crop biomass increases the risk of competition with cash crops. (3) The balance between the services and disservices provided can primarily be interpreted in terms of biomass production of coexisting crops. The resulting effect of service crops on cash crop yield is variable and reflects the integration of the effects of the various individual services, together with possible disservices. (4) The diversity in management methods makes it possible to manage this trade-off and to adapt the system to different conditions with a few tested species.

Soybean crop is not exception to climate change. Crop growth simulation modelling approach has been established as a valuable tool to determine climate uncertainty on soybean yield. However, the crop growth model must be calibrated and evaluated for new regions before application for climate change assessment. Limited studies are available about evaluation of CSM-CROPGRO-Soybean model and its application for climate change impact on soybean in spring and autumn seasons under arid conditions. Field experiments were conducted in spring and autumn season in 2019 and 2020 at farmer field in Multan, Pakistan. During spring season experiments, cultivars Williams-82, NARC-1 and Ajmeri were placed in main plots in both seasons, while dates were 10th Jan, 20th Jan, 01st Feb, 10th Feb and 20th Feb during spring season while sowing dates were 01st Jul, 15th Jul, 01st Aug, 15th Aug and 30th Aug in autumn were allocated in sub plots. Results indicated that after calibration, performance of model was well due to acceptable ranged values of error and root mean square error (RMSE). In sensitivity analysis, model was responsive to CO2, temperature and rainfall. Climate change reduced more seed yield in autumn season as compared to spring season. Without adaptation strategies, seed yield will be reduced by 22.73% in spring and 35.91% in autumn season during mid-century at all GCMs at RCP 8.5. With adopting adaptation strategies of seven days earlier sowing of spring soybean and ten days delay sowing of autumn crop, along with growing climate resilient cultivars can minimize the negative impact of climate change.

Current cotton pests and diseases management is dependent on chemical pesticides. Although chemical pesticides are usually effective, long-term application of these pesticides often leads to increased insecticide resistance in the pests, fewer natural enemies, reduced natural control, and a degraded environment. Because of increased environmental awareness and the need for sustainable cotton production, the control of cotton pests and diseases using biological means like intercropping is increasingly receiving attention. Intercropping of cotton with other crops can often boost the total yield and output of the intercropping system and provide significant economic benefits without sacrificing cotton quality. Intercropping also increases the number of natural enemies, and reduces the occurrence of cotton pests and diseases by altering the ecological structure and environmental conditions in the fields. Cotton-based intercropping is an effective strategy to reduce the competition between cotton and grain or other economic crops for arable land. It is also an important way to increase the populations of natural enemies in cotton fields for the management of pests and diseases. However, inappropriate intercropping can also increase labor requirements and even result in inadequate control of pests and diseases. This review focuses on the performance and the mechanisms of intercropping for reducing cotton pests and disease as well as on the effective management of intercropping systems. The risks and limitations, as well as the study approaches needed and the prospects of intercropping for the control of cotton pests and diseases, are also discussed. This information is intended to aid researchers and growers in designing economically viable and ecologically friendly pest and disease management strategies that will reduce the use of chemicals and the cost of cotton production.

Industrialized farming in more developed countries has increased global food supply to meet the demand, but the excessive use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides has negative environmental impacts. Finding sustainable ways to grow more food with a smaller environmental footprint is critical. We developed an integrated cropping system that incorporates four key components: 1) intensified cropping through relay planting or intercropping, 2) within-field strip rotation, 3) soil mulching with available means, such as crop straw, and 4) no-till or reduced tillage. Sixteen field experiments, conducted with a wide range of crop inputs over 12 consecutive years (2006 to 2017), showed that the integrated system with intercropping generates significant synergies-increasing annual crop yields by 15.6 to 49.9% and farm net returns by 39.2% and decreasing the environmental footprint by 17.3%-when compared with traditional monoculture cropping. We conclude that smallholder farmers can achieve the dual goals of growing more food and lowering the environmental footprint by adopting integrated farming systems.

Aims We aimed to explore the effects of Fallopia multiflora-Andrographis paniculata intercropping model on yield, quality, soil nutrition and rhizosphere microorganisms of F. multiflora, an important raw material of a traditional Chinese medicine. The data will provide empirical evidence for the application and promotion of the system in agricultural production. Methods F. multiflora's yield, potential medicinal quality, and rhizosphere soil nutrient contents, pH, enzyme activities, and microbial characteristics (such as diversity and structure of the bacterial community) were compared between the intercropped system and a monoculture of F. multiflora. Results Compared with the monoculture of F. multiflora, F. multiflora-A. paniculata intercropping significantly increased the stem diameter, root fresh weight, yield and stilbene glycoside content of F. multiflora. The activities of urease and sucrase and the amounts of bacteria and actinomycetes in rhizosphere soil of intercropped F. multiflora were significantly higher than those in rhizosphere soil of the monoculture. Intercropping increased the diversity of rhizosphere bacteria and the relative abundances of potentially beneficial microorganisms. Correlation analysis shows that the yield and quality of F. multiflora were closely related to urease and invertase activities, alkaline hydrolysis nitrogen content, soil organic matter content, bacterial biomass, and pH. The results of principal component analysis show that the score of intercropping soil was higher than that of monoculture soil.

Intercropping is new good agricultural practice for phytoremediation in Cd contaminated soil. Field and pot experiments were conducted to examine the effects of intercropping low Cd-accumulating rice with Sesbania cannabina on plant growth, uptake of Cd by the intercropping system, and rhizosphere microecology, and to evaluate the potential remediation of Cd contaminated soil and safety production of rice. The results of in the field experiment show that, in intercropping system, the concentration of Cd in the grain of rice (0.18 mg kg(-1)) was below the threshold level permitted by the National Food Safety Standard of China (GB 2762-2017, 0.20 mg kg(-1)). Furthermore, the yield per plant of rice in intercropping system significantly (P < 0.05) increased by 19.71%. At the same time, the bio-concentration amount (BCA) of Cd per plant of Sesbania cannabina in intercropping system significantly (P < 0.05) increased by 46.15%. The metal removal equivalent ratio (MRER) of Cd was 1.11, indicating that the intercropping system had advantage in Cd removal. In the pot experiment, the rice intercropped with Sesbania cannabina under no barrier (IN) treatment significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the content of rhizosphere organic acids (oxalic and malic acids), and significantly (P < 0.05) increased the rhizosphere pH value and total iron plaque concentration on the root surface compared to the intercropping with plastic barrier (IN+P) treatment, which could significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the available Cd content in rhizosphere soil and the accumulation of Cd in rice organs. With this study we demonstrated that lower rhizosphere organic acids and higher iron plaque can obstruct and decreased the Cd absorbed by rice in a rice-Sesbania cannabina intercropping system. We conclude that intercropping rice with Sesbania cannabina is a promising and cost-effective agricultural practice for safe crop production and for phytoremediation in Cd-contaminated paddy soil.

However, there is little understanding of how diazotrophs respond to intercropping and soil physicochemical properties in cucumber continuous cropping systems. In this study, using the nifH gene as a marker, we have examined the impacts of seven intercropping plants on diazotrophic community diversity and composition compared to a cucumber continuous cropping system during two cropping seasons. The results showed that intercropping increased the abundance of the nifH gene, which was negatively correlated with available phosphorous in the fall. Diazotrophic diversity and richness were higher in the rape-cucumber system than in the monoculture. Multivariate regression tree analysis revealed that the diversity of the diazotrophic communties was shaped mainly by soil moisture and available phosphorous. Skermanella were the dominant genera in all of the samples, which increased significantly in the mustard-cucumber system in the fall. There was no effect of intercropping on the structure of the diazotrophic community in this case. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis showed that cropping season had a greater effect than intercropping on the community structure of the diazotrophs. Overall, our results suggest that intercropping altered the abundance and diversity rather than the structure of the diazotrophic community, which may potentially affect the N fixation ability of continuous cropping systems.

The different patterns of post-heat stress responses in wheat genotypes: the role of the transthylakoid proton gradient in efficient recovery of leaf photosynthetic capacity	PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH			English	Article						"Wheat; Heat stress; Recovery; Electrochromic bandshift; Proton transport; Ploidy"	"ELECTRON-TRANSPORT; THYLAKOID MEMBRANE; PHOTOSYSTEM-I; MOTIVE FORCE; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; THERMAL-STABILITY; GENETIC DIVERSITY; CO2 ASSIMILATION; HIGH-TEMPERATURE"	The frequency and severity of heat waves are expected to increase in the near future, with a significant impact on physiological functions and yield of crop plants. In this study, we assessed the residual post-heat stress effects on photosynthetic responses of six diverse winter wheat (Triticum sp.) genotypes, differing in country of origin, taxonomy and ploidy (tetraploids vs. hexaploids). After 5 days of elevated temperatures (up to 38 degrees C), the photosynthetic parameters recorded on the first day of recovery (R1) as well as after the next 4-5 days of the recovery (R2) were compared to those of the control plants (C) grown under moderate temperatures. Based on the values of CO2 assimilation rate (A) and the maximum rates of carboxylation (V-Cmax) in R1, we identified that the hexaploid (HEX) and tetraploid (TET) species clearly differed in the strength of their response to heat stress. Next, the analyses of gas exchange, simultaneous measurements of PSI and PSII photochemistry and the measurements of electrochromic bandshift (ECS) have consistently shown that photosynthetic and photoprotective functions in leaves of TET genotypes were almost fully recovered in R2, whereas the recovery of photosynthetic and photoprotective functions in the HEX group in R2 was still rather low. A poor recovery was associated with an overly reduced acceptor side of photosystem I as well as high values of the electric membrane potential (Delta psi component of the proton motive force, pmf) in the chloroplast. On the other hand, a good recovery of photosynthetic capacity and photoprotective functions was clearly associated with an enhanced Delta pH component of the pmf, thus demonstrating a key role of efficient regulation of proton transport to ensure buildup of the transthylakoid proton gradient needed for photosynthesis restoration after high-temperature episodes.

Intercropping can increase water use efficiency (WUE) of crops and optimize the soi l moisture environment for crop development. Competition and complementarity ar e two aspects of the same interspecific relationship between crops, and a quantitative understanding of the competition and complementary effects of intercrops on soi l resources is important for advancement of intercropping systems. The characteristics and mechanisms of water utilization and interspecies relationships in intercropping are reviewed in this paper. The main regulation approaches for efficient water utilization in intercropping are based on interspecific competition and complementarity include crop species, irrigation and fertilization regimes, plant density, spatial arrangement, tillage and mulching practices, and environmental factors. Interspecific competition and complementarity are leading factors influencing water utilization of intercrops and studies on synergistic effects of competition and complementarity in intercropping systems are of importance for water utilization. Future research should investigate the relationship between water competition and complementation between different intercrops and inter-zone water migration. Integrating results from different studies could provide a basis for enhancing WUE of intercropping through advanced understanding of approaches for regulating interspecific interactions. This would provide support for the development and adoption of intercropping systems in water-deficient areas.

Still, information is lacking regarding integrated benefits of the whole system, including valuing of the biomass for facing the constraints of animal feedings. We used farmers' learning networks to evaluate performance of intercropping systems of millet-cowpea and sorghum-cowpea in southern Mali. Our results showed that under intercropping, the grain yield obtained with the wilibali (short maturing duration) variety was significantly higher than the yield obtained with the sangaranka (long maturing duration) variety whether with millet (36%) or sorghum (48%), corresponding, respectively, to an economic gain of XOF (West African CFA franc) 125 282/ha and XOF 142 640/ha. While for biomass, the yield obtained with the sangaranka variety was significantly higher by 50% and 60% to that of wilibali with an economic gain of XOF 286 526/ha (with millet) and XOF 278 516/ha (with sorghum). Total gain obtained with the millet-cowpea system was significantly greater than that obtained with the sorghum-cowpea system by 14%, and this stands irrespective of the type of cowpea variety. Farmers prefer the grain for satisfying immediate food needs instead of economic gains. These results represent an indication for farmer's decision-making regarding cowpea varieties selection especially for addressing household food security issues or feeding animals.

Therefore, an experiment involving high (300 kg ha(-1) for corn and 250 kg ha(-1) for tomato), medium (210 kg ha(-1) for corn and 175 kg ha(-1) for tomato), and low (150 kg ha 1 for corn and 125 kg ha - for tomato) N-fertilizer applications (HF, ME, I.E. respectively) was conducted in the corn and tomato intercropping ecosystem during 2014 (a calibration period for modeling) and 2015 (a validation period for modeling). The modified HYDRUS-2D code was used to analyze soil NO3-N concentrations (SNC) in the middle between corn rows (P-c), between corn and tomato rows (P-b), and between tomato rows (P-t), NO3-N exchange in the horizontal direction between different regions, NO3-N leaching from the corn, the bare, and the tomato region, and N uptake by crops. Simulated SNCs were in good agreement with measurements, with RMSE, NSE, and MRE of 0.01-0.06 mg cm(-3), 0.75-0.98, and 8.7-19.1%, respectively, during the validation period (2015). Average SNCs in the 0-40cm soil layer were different between P-c, P-t, and P-b. Intensive NO3-N exchange in the horizontal direction occurred during the second stage (Day After Sowing [DAS] 37-113 in 2014: DAS 29-120 in 2015). NO3-N exchange between the corn and bare regions was lower than between the tomato and bare regions due to smaller concentration gradients. However, in the vertical direction, NO3-N leaching from the corn region in both years was 4.1 and 8.8 times larger, respectively, than from the tomato region under HF since NO3-N mainly moved from the tomato region to the corn region. Our results reveal the competition between corn and tomato for N and provide a rationale for formulating and optimizing different fertilizer regimes for different crops in the intercropping ecosystem.

Materials and Methods: Nine types of soybean materials were selected to make WSCs and CSCs. Protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS) and principal component analysis were selected to perform the comparative analysis of amino acid profiles of the products. Results: Total contents of amino acids in WSCs and CSCs were 41.24-54.87 mg/g and 27.77-36.82 mg/g. Content ranges of essential amino acids were 13.59-19.38 mg/g and 8.46-11.76 mg/g for WSCs and CSCs. The essential amino acid pattern of WSCs was basically close to amino acid pattern spectrum requirements except valine and sulfur amino acids. As a limiting amino acid, methionine represented less than 0.4 for PDCAAS in all soybean curds except WSCs made from relay-cropping Nandou12 and Nandou25. Conclusions: The overall quality of amino acids in WSCs was higher than that in CSCs, indicating that WSCs indeed exhibited higher nutritional value than CSCs from the viewpoint of amino acid profile. WSCs with the high nutritional value could be made using Nandou25 and relay-cropping Nandou12 as materials.

By measuring the medium diameter and analyzing the protein subunit composition of rWSF and heated whole soybean flour (hWSF), we found that HSS effectively micronized the insoluble fraction in suspension (especially the component cell layers of seed coat) but destroyed the structure of the native protein and caused the disappearance of specific protein band 7 in sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Further, we made WSC using HSS-treated hWSF suspension and analyzed its characteristics. The relative contents of alpha-helix, beta-sheet, and beta-turns all decreased after HSS, but the surface hydrophobicity showed an opposite trend. Additionally, the maximum emission wavelength blue- shifted after HSS. These results indicated that the secondary and tertiary structures of WSC were changed by HSS. Moreover, microstructural analysis based on a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and texture analyzer suggested that HSS led to the formation of a loose and less connected gel network and weakened the gel strength consequently. In summary, to separate and micronize okara individually and add them back to soymilk for WSC making was a considerable method.

J	"Wang, XY; Gao, YZ"				"Wang, Xinyu; Gao, Yingzhi"			Advances in the mechanism of cereal/legume intercropping promotion of symbiotic nitrogen fixation	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE			Chinese	Article						"symbiotic nitrogen fixation; root exudates; arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; intercropping; rhizosphere process"	"N-2 FIXATION; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; N TRANSFER; SOIL N; LEGUME; PEA; PRODUCTIVITY; NODULATION; CARBON; CROP"	Biological nitrogen fixation by rhizobia in symbiotic association with legumes is a valuable N source for agroecosystems, and thus it is crucial for increased sustainability of agricultural production. Previous studies found that legume and cereal intercropping can promote symbiotic nitrogen fixation mainly due to rhizosphere nitrogen depletion by the cereal and that soil mineral nitrogen is absorbed more by cereals than legumes, which forces the legume to increase its reliance on symbiotic nitrogen fixation. However, in addition to the nitrogen depletion theory in the rhizosphere, stoichiometry (such as nitrogen and phosphorus coupling) and molecular regulation mechanisms are also important in understanding legume nitrogen fixation. The legume usually maintains a stable stoichiometric relationship between nitrogen and phosphorus. Symbiotic nitrogen fixation of legumes tends to have a high demand for phosphorus, mainly because nitrogen fixation by legumes is a high energy-consuming process, and the required energy is directly provided by ATP. Therefore, when the phosphorus obtained by the intercropped legume is insufficient to meet the increase in symbiotic nitrogen fixation, legume growth is limited by phosphorus. Under phosphorus limitation, the phosphorus uptake strategy of the legume can be stimulated, i.e. by increasing the infection of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and secretion of root exudates. The AMF mycelia of legumes can extend beyond the rhizosphere, linking the roots to the surrounding soil microhabitats and expanding the area of phosphorus absorbed by the roots. On the other hand, mobilizing rhizosphere insoluble phosphorus through root exudates is also an important pathway for improving phosphorus utilization. Increased soil phosphorus availability promotes plant growth and increased allocation of carbon (C) sources to roots and nodules, resulting in a larger root system or greater nodule formation, finally higher symbiotic nitrogen fixation. In addition, the formation of root nodules is influenced by rhizosphere talk between the cereal and legume, which are directly related to the level of nitrogen. A recent study found that under low N concentration conditions, cereal root exudates stimulated flavonoid biosynthesis and secretion partly through upregulating expression of the Chalcone-flavanone isomerase gene (CFI) in legumes. Meanwhile, an auxin-responsive GH3 family gene (GH3.1) and the nodulation gene ENODL2 displayed significant increases, suggesting that nodulation continues under the regulation of auxin signaling and the nodulin-like protein. At nodule maturity, cereal root exudates continue to up-regulate key nodulation genes, such as NODL4, ENOD93 and the N fixation gene FixI3, finally promoting symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Moreover, a high concentration of soil mineral N significantly suppressed expression of the early nodulin gene NIN in Lotus corniculatus, which inhibited nodulation and symbiotic nitrogen fixation. In the cereal/legume intercropping system, rhizosphere nitrogen depletion can relieve the inhibition of nitrate on the expression of key nodulation and N fixation genes, thus promoting nodulation and symbiotic nitrogen fixation. In conclusion, intercropping can promote nitrogen uptake and optimize nitrogen use efficiency through the coupling effects of rhizosphere nitrogen depletion, phosphorus mobilization and the regulation of nitrogen fixation genes. This review will help improve our understanding of the mechanism of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in the cereal/legume intercropping system.

However, there has been few studies of intercropping in minor grain crops, and we therefore designed an experiment to monitor rhizosphere soil properties, enzyme activities, and the microbial community diversity of proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) under proso millet /mung bean intercropping systems on the Loess Plateau of China, and a sole planting was used as a control. Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and ITS gene was used to analyze soil microbial (bacterial and fungal) diversity and composition. The results showed that the rhizosphere soil nutrient contents and enzyme activities were higher under intercropping patterns with significant correlations being observed. The physical properties were also changed, including the soil water content, bulk density, and soil temperature. The effect of intercropping patterns on bacterial diversity was larger than that on fungal diversity, especially alpha diversity, although both groups were markedly affected by intercropping patterns. Actinobacteria was the most abundant bacterial phylum, which was decreased by 32.37% under intercropping. Other phylum species, including Proteobacteria, Chloroffexi, Gemmatimonadetes, Acidobacteria, Nitrospirae, and Firmicutes were also markedly affected by intercropping patterns. For the dominant fungal phyla, Ascomycota, Mortierellomycota, and Basidiomycota did not respond substantially to intercropping patterns. Binding spatial ordination analysis demonstrated that soil temperature and bulk density for bacteria and total nitrogen and nitrate contents for fungi contribute more to the microbial community than the other investigated soil parameters, whereas the soil enzyme activities played the same roles in bacteria and fungi. Overall, these results suggest that intercropping alters soil microbial community composition, and the soil bacteria reflect changes in soil properties and enzyme activities better than fungi. Meanwhile, these findings also provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of biodiversity in the agro-ecosystems functioning.

CRANTZ; NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION; TILLAGE SYSTEMS; OILSEED CROPS; SPRING WHEAT; WATER-USE; OIL; YIELD; SUPPRESSION"	Camelina (Camelina saliva L. Crantz) is a minor oilseed crop identified as a candidate crop for biorefinery in Europe. This crop should therefore meet specific quantitative, qualitative and environmental requirements. Weeds have been identified as a major problem for growing camelina. Weed competition may result in low camelina yields and poor seed oil quality. Herbicide application during the crop cycle is more over often not effective enough and does not match with a sustainable production. This study aimed at assessing the effect of four crop management routes (CMRs) on weed biomass and camelina yields across various environments in northern France. Three spring camelina CMRs without herbicide were specifically designed: one consisted in doubling camelina sowing rate (DD), and two others consisted in intercropping camelina with either barley (CB) or pea (CP). These CMRs were compared with a current chemical weeding-based crop management route (SD). These four CMRs were tested in nine on-farm trials covering two growing seasons and three soil types. Crop and weed biomass were measured at camelina flowering and maturity stages, and crop yields were estimated at harvest. Across the nine environments, crop biomass was significantly higher in both intercrops than in pure stand (SD and DD). Weed biomass varied across CMRs and environments, and was negatively correlated with total crop biomass, thus explaining the better weed control observed in the intercrops. Considering the nine environments, DD and CP did not significantly impact camelina yields in comparison to SD. However, camelina yields were reduced by 90% in CB due to strong competition from barley. In conclusion, both DD and CP seemed to be promising alternatives to reduce weed competition without using herbicides. In the future, multi-criteria assessment covering quality, environment, and economic performances would be useful to conclude on the implementation of these CMRs in on-farm conditions.

The first factor was given by 10 different cropping patterns including common bean monoculture, fennel monoculture, dragonhead monoculture and different intercropping ratios, 1:1:1, 1:2:1, 1:3:1, 2:1:2, 2:2:2, 2:3:2, 2:4:2 (fennel: common bean: dragonhead), whereas the second factor was represented by usage or not of humic acid (organic manure). The results demonstrated that the highest seed yield of fennel and common bean and biological yield of dragonhead were recorded in the monoculture of each plant. Application of humic acid increased the seed yield productivity of common bean and fennel and biological yield of dragonhead compared with control (i.e. no application of humic acid) by 10, 16 and 7%, respectively. Also, concentrations of N, P, K, Ca and Mg in most of intercropping patterns increased over the monocultures. Additionally, the different intercropping patterns and application of humic acid improved the content of (E)-anethole, fenchone and limonene in fennel EO and those of geranial, neral and neryl acetate in dragonhead EO, over the control. Overall, intercropping of fennel and dragonhead with common bean under humic acid application could improve the EO quality and quantity of the mentioned medicinal and aromatic herbs and can be recommended to farmers as an alternative, sustainable and cleaner cultural system.

Short-term dynamics of soil organic matter fractions and microbial activity in smallholder potato-legume intercropping systems	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY			English	Article						"Intercropping; Microbial activity; Microbial biomass; Soil organic matter dynamics; Soil organic matter fractions"	"SOLANUM-TUBEROSUM-L.; COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; ENZYME-ACTIVITY; CARBON; TILLAGE; BIOMASS; NITROGEN; WHEAT; DECOMPOSITION; TEMPERATURE"	Continuous cultivation of potato (Solarium tuberosum L.) in monoculture systems represents the greatest factor deteriorating soil organic matter (SOM) in smallholder farms. With an aim to breaking this norm, a 2-year field trial intercropping potato with two legumes: lima bean (Phaseolus Iunatus) and dolichos (Lablab purpureus), was conducted in the upper-midland (1552 meters above sea level (masl.)), lower-highland (1854 masl.) and upper-highland (2552 masl.) agro-ecologies of Kenya. Residues from each cropping system were quantified at the end of each season and incorporated back into the soil at start of the subsequent season. A combined physical and density fractionation was used to separate the soil in macro-aggregates ( > 250 mu m), micro-aggregates (250-50 mu m) and silt plus clay fractions ( < 50 mu m), while SOM was partitioned into labile (density of 1.65 to 1.85 g cm(-3)) and stable (2.60 g cm(-3)) fractions. Microbial biomass contents were determined by chloroform fumigation while enzymatic activities were assessed by hydrolyses of fluorescein diacetate and dehydrogenase. Compared to sole potato, intercropping increased the contents of light fraction organic matter by 12-28%, dissolved organic matter by 7-21% and microbial biomass by 15-38%, thus stimulating enzyme activities. Trends in soil microbial respiration followed those of enzyme activity and were 20-34% higher in intercropping than in sole potato. Intercropping ensured high residue returns which got short-term residence within the macro-aggregates, thus ensuring steady supply of substrates to the soil microbes.

Light-induced systemic signalling down-regulates photosynthetic performance of soybean leaves with different directional effects	PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						"Directional effects; light heterogeneity; light signalling; photosynthates; photosynthesis; soybean (Glycine max L; Merr; ); systemic regulation"	"TRIFOLIATE LEAVES; INDUCTION; MATURE; PLANT; SINK; LEAF"	When plants are exposed to a heterogeneous environment, photosynthesis of leaves is not only determined by their local condition, but also by certain signals from other parts of the same plant, termed systemic regulation. Our present study was conducted to investigate the effects of light-dependent systemic regulation on the photosynthetic performance of soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) under heterogeneous light conditions. Soybean plants were treated with heterogeneous light. Then gas exchange characteristics were measured to evaluate the photosynthetic performance of leaves. Parameters related to photosynthetic pigments, chlorophyll fluorescence, Rubisco and photosynthates were examined to study the mechanisms of light-dependent systemic regulation on photosynthesis. Light-induced systemic signalling by illuminated leaves reduced the P-n of both upper and lower non-illuminated leaves on the same soybean plant. The decrease in g(s) and increase in C-i in these non-illuminated leaves indicated restriction of carbon assimilation, which was further verified by the decline in content and activity of Rubisco. However, the activation state of Rubisco decreased only in upper non-illuminated leaves. Quantum efficiency of PSII (phi PSII) and ETR also decreased only in upper non-illuminated leaves. Moreover, the effects of light-induced systemic signalling on carbohydrate content were also detectable only in upper non-illuminated leaves. Light-induced systemic signalling by illuminated leaves restricts carbon assimilation and down-regulates photosynthetic performance of non-illuminated leaves within a soybean plant. However, effects of such systemic regulation differed when regulated in upward or downward direction.	"[Sun, X.; Lu, J.; Yang, M. Y.; Huang, S. R.; Du, J. B.; Wang, X.

Two main spoilage strains were isolated from spoiled WSC and identified as B. subtilis and B. cereus. The origin analysis confirmed that B. subtilis and B. cereus originated from soybean materials and survived in soybean curd. For microbial contamination analysis, thermotolerant coliforms, E. coli and S. aureus were not detected in soybean curd. The predicted shelf life of WSC and okara-filtered curd that was stored at 10 degrees C were 141.95 h (5.91 d) and 206.25 h (8.59 d), respectively. Moreover, the models applied in this study exhibited great fitting goodness and the predicted growth parameters were fail-safe. To conclude, introduction of okara into soybean curd reinforced the initial contamination level but didn't significantly increase the risk profile of WSC.

In fact, the potential of legume-brassica intercrops was enormous to improve crop yields, biomass, nitrogen uptake, the economic reliability via land equivalent ratio, and so on. Therefore, in the present study, the Chinese milk vetch (Astragalus sinicus L.)-rape (Brassica napus L.) intercropping system was investigated. The specific objective of this study was to investigate how Chinese milk vetch affects the soil microbial community in rhizosphere of rape. Methods A series of bucket experiments based on Chinese milk vetch-rape intercrops, included root separation and straw mulching, were employed to explore the soil properties and soil microbes in rhizosphere of rape. Results Intercropping substantially decreased the organic carbon content and the total nitrogen content and changed the C/N ratios. Intercropping also decreased the soil microbial biomass in rape rhizosphere (including the total PLFAs, bacteria, actinomycete, AM-fungi, and so on). In addition, intercropping and straw mulching also changed the structure of soil microbial community in rape rhizosphere, which was significantly correlated with 16:1w9c and 18:3w6c (6, 9, 12). At the same time, under the influence of intercropping Chinese milk vetch, soil microbial functional activity in rape rhizosphere was significantly reduced. Soil microbial community functional composition in rape rhizosphere was also changed greatly by intercropping, which was significantly correlated with D-glucosaminic acid and g-1-phosphate under no straw mulching, and glycogen, D-xylose and 2-hydroxy benzoic acid under straw mulching. Conclusions Intercropping Chinese milk vetch decreased soil microbial biomass and functional activity and changed greatly the soil microbial community structural and functional composition in rape rhizosphere. Our findings revealed that root interaction between Chinese milk vetch and rape was a crucial factor to manage the crop intercropping, which might, in turn, determine the soil microbe on rhizosphere.

By using single factor experiment, surface response optimization, and principal component analysis, operation parameters for processing WSC were optimized: frequency 25 Hz, time 9 min, and water-to-powder ratio 6:1 for superfine grinding, power 150 W, time 9 min, and water-to-powder ratio 5.5:1 for ultrasonic disruption, cellulase concentration 9 U/g powder, temperature 45 degrees C, and time 35 min for enzymolysis. Significant differences in textural properties and sensory quality of WSCs made under optimized parameters were observed, which were closely related to different effects generated by the three techniques on okara. Among the three types of WSC, WSC fabricated by superfine grinding exhibited enhanced textural properties, such as gel strength 1.43 N, cohesiveness 64.06, and chewiness 0.60 N mm, which were significantly higher than those of traditional soybean curd (TSC) (gel strength 1.13 N, cohesiveness 46.32, and chewiness 0.42 N mm) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, no significant difference in sensory quality was found between this type of WSC and TSC (p > 0.05). Fabrication of WSC with desirable edible quality using suitable technique and appropriate parameters was confirmed and could be further developed for commercial application.

Intercropping is regarded as an effective strategy in sustainable agriculture. Therefore, current study was carried out to evaluate the nutrient uptake of onion and fenugreek intercropping system during two growing season of (2015-2016 and 2016-2017) at a research field in Kerman, Iran. Two factorial experiments based on completely random blocks design with three replications were carried out. The treatments in this study were including: onion densities as the first factor (30, 25 and 20 plants m(-2)) and fenugreek densities as the second factor at three levels of 25, 15 and 12 plants m(-2) with sole cropping of two species at these densities. Results showed that in the both of years, mineral concentration and uptake (N, P and K) of onion leaf and bulb and fenugreek in intercropping increased in comparison with mono cropping for two species. In both years, the highest and lowest nutrient content of onion was observed in the densities of 30 and 20 plant m(-2). In general, it can be said that intercropping systems have some positive effects on nutrient content and uptake of onion.

The results showed that TGase modified the water distribution and reduced the cooking loss of WSC, accompanying with increased water holding capacity. The bloom value of WSC was upgraded as the TGase concentration increased. Although certain sensory parameters showed different scores in groups, the overall acceptability of 1500ppm group was the highest. TPA test suggested that hardness, springiness and chewiness were promoted by TGase significantly. Smooth appearance of WSC was observed, resulting from the transformation of microstructure. Protein subunits of 7S', 7S, 7S, 11SA3, 11S acidic, and 11S basic proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, band intensity of protein subunits declined at storage and cooking phase, indicating that crosslinking of proteins was still in progress. In conclusion, the addition of TGase improved the quality of CaCl2-induced WSC and could be used to facilitate the production of this new type of soybean product.

The space between rows of grass can be utilized by incorporating forage legumes. This 3-year study evaluated two genotypes of guinea grass in monocropping and intercropping with cowpea and Egyptian clover under different N management options. Guinea grass genotype BG-2 produced higher dry-matter yields than BG-1, both in monocropping and in intercropping. However, dry-matter yield of forage legumes was higher under BG-1. The yield advantage in terms of land equivalent ratio was higher in BG-1 (1.69) than BG-2 (1.60). BG-1 was more dominant than BG-2 in intercropping. Soil properties such as dehydrogenase activity, microbial biomass carbon and available N were improved under grass-legume intercropping compared with grass alone. Higher crude protein and N uptake were also observed in BG-2. Net returns of grass-legumes intercropping were 30%-40% higher compared with monocropping of guinea grass. Among N management options, higher growth, crude protein content and forage yield were achieved with application of 40 kg N/ha after each cut of guinea grass in double split. Therefore, guinea grass + cowpea-Egyptian clover intercropping with 40 kg N/ha after each grass cut in double split can be suggested for higher forage productivity, profitability and soil properties.

Optimum plot size of planting and bio-agroeconomic revenues from arugula-carrot intercropping systems in a semi-arid region	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS			English	Article						"Daucus carota; Eruca sativa; Plot size; Intercrop; Bio-agroeconomic index"	"SAMPLE-SIZE; ITALIAN PUMPKIN; YIELD; SHAPE; REPLACEMENT; COEFFICIENT; COMPETITION; WHEAT; SOIL"	The production of vegetable crops has been characterized as a highly intensive activity in the use of soil, water, inputs and labor in semi-arid regions, being practiced mostly by small family farmers as a way of subsistence, or in the small-scale commercialization of surplus production. Among the agricultural practices that have been successfully used by vegetable producers are intercrop systems that, when implemented with adequate management, present gains in productivity, nutritional, economic, and environmental value. The aim of this study was to estimate the optimal plot sizes of plantings of carrot (Daucus carota L.) intercropped with arugula (Eruca sativa L.) in bi-cultivation in three spatial arrangements, as well as to determine bio-agroeconomic revenues from associations between these vegetable crops in a semi-arid region. Estimates of optimal sizes of experimental plots in intercropping systems, provided by the methods of bootstrap resampling and of sampling intensity (10%), were four, four and three basic units, respectively, for the spatial arrangements 2R:2C, 3R:3C, and 4R:4C, between rows of arugula (R) intercropped with carrot (C), and by the Hatheway method, all spatial arrangements were of four basic units. The best bio-agroeconomic performance of carrot intercropped with arugula in bi-cultivation was obtained in the spatial arrangement 2R:2C.	"[De Carvalho, Frank W.

SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						"land equivalent ratio; legume-cereal intercrop; physical quality; physiological quality; seed production"	"COMPETITION; PEA"	Seed laws regard farmer seeds as inferior because they are produced under intercropping rather than sole cropping conditions. This, however, is not supported by rigorous research and has kept smallholders out of the seed industry. A two-year study compared the quality of seeds produced under intercropping and sole cropping systems at sites in different agro-ecologies. At each site, sole sorghum, cowpea, sugar bean and groundnut, and intercrops of each legume with sorghum were planted in five randomised complete blocks. Seed yield, land equivalent ratio (LER) and physiological quality were assessed. The lowest LER was 0.837 for sugar bean-sorghum intercrops and highest, 2.879, for groundnut-sorghum intercrops. Germination ranged from 86.4 to 96.8% for seeds from intercrops compared with 79.2 to 95.4% for seeds from sole crops and all were above the minimum required by the local seed laws. Physical quality ranged from 95.3 to 98.4% for intercrops and 88.1 to 99% for sole crops, while the standard is 99%. Low purity was caused by foreign material. Sanitary quality was better for intercrops. The study showed that the legumes could be grown for seeds under intercropping systems, and thus, there is an opportunity for smallholders to enter the seed industry.

Controlled-release urea (CRU) has been shown to increase crop yields, yet the long term effects of CRU on soil NO3--N distribution are not well known. A 4-year field experiment applied 50% (100 kg ha(-1)), 100% (200 kg ha(-1)) and 150% (300 kg ha(-1)) of the local practice N rates with CRU and urea was conducted under cotton-garlic intercropping system in Shandong Province, China. The linear increase in garlic yield and curvilinear increase in cotton yield indicates that crop yields increased as the input N rate increased with both urea and CRU while exceeded N application decreased cotton yields. The successive release of N from CRU permitted the meeting of the full N requirements of crops grown. Consequently, the lint cotton yield of CRU treatments was increased by 5.2%-17.3%, and garlic bulb yield increased by 2.0%-7.4%, compared with urea treatment. Although the CRU100% supplied one-third less N than Urea150%, the CRU100% produced -0.6%-5.6% more cotton, and -4.0%-2.6% more garlic than Urea150%. The NO3--N contents of CRU treatments were augmented in 0-40 cm soil, but the opposite trend was found in 60-100 cm soil. The organic matter and total N contents in 0-40 cm profile were increased with CRU fertilization over 4-year fertilization. However, no prominent difference of available P and K contents in 0-20 cm soil was observed between CRU and urea treatments. Thus a one-third decrease in the recommended N application rate of urea is possible with CRU while maintaining crops yield, decreasing NO3--N leaching to deep soil layer and preserving the soil fertility in North China plain.

The yield of chickpea increased progressively with the increase in number of rows of chickpea in every intercropping system. All the intercropping systems produced higher land equivalent ratio (LER) than their respective sole cropping. Chickpea and fennel (4:2 row ratio) recorded higher benefit in terms of monetary advantage index (MAI) (Rs. 6990 ha(-1)), income equivalent ratio (IER) (2.03), system productivity index (SPI) or intercropping advantages (IA) among the all the intercropping systems. All the three spices performed as a dominant component, while chickpea was suppressed, and higher competition was noticed when coriander was taken as an intercrop, while competition was less in chickpea and fennel intercropping system.

Salinity stress has adverse effects on soybean development periods, especially on seed germination and post-germinative growth. Improving seed germination and emergence will have positive effects under salt stress conditions on agricultural production. Here we report that NaCl delays soybean seed germination by negatively regulating gibberellin (GA) while positively mediating abscisic acid (ABA) biogenesis, which leads to a decrease in the GA/ABA ratio. This study suggests that fluridone (FLUN), an ABA biogenesis inhibitor, might be a potential plant growth regulator that can promote soybean seed germination under saline stress. Different soybean cultivars, which possessed distinct genetic backgrounds, showed a similar repressed phenotype during seed germination under exogenous NaCl application. Biochemical analysis revealed that NaCl treatment led to high MDA (malondialdehyde) level during germination and the post-germinative growth stages. Furthermore, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and peroxidase activities also changed after NaCl treatment. Subsequent quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction analysis showed that the transcription levels of ABA and GA biogenesis and signaling genes were altered after NaCl treatment. In line with this, phytohormone measurement also revealed that NaCl considerably down-regulated active GA1, GA3, and GA4 levels, whereas the ABA content was up-regulated; and therefore ratios, such as GA1/ABA, GA3/ABA, and GA4/ABA, are decreased. Consistent with the hormonal quantification, FLUN partially rescued the delayed-germination phenotype caused by NaCl-treatment. Altogether, these results demonstrate that NaCl stress inhibits soybean seed germination by decreasing the GA/ABA ratio, and that FLUN might be a potential plant growth regulator that could promote soybean seed germination under salinity stress."

A total of 62,382 fungal ITS1 sequences clustered into 164 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with 97% sequence similarity; 69 taxa were recovered from the samples by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequencing. The fungal community compositions differed among the tested soybeans, with 42 OTUs being amplified from all varieties. The quadratic relationships between fungal diversity and organ-specific mildew indexes were analyzed, confirming that mildew on soybean pods can mitigate FM damage to the seeds. In addition, four potentially pathogenic fungi were isolated from FM-damaged soybean fruits; morphological and molecular identification confirmed these fungi as Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, Fusarium moniliforme, and Penicillium chrysogenum. Further re-inoculation experiments demonstrated that F. moniliforme is dominant among these FM pathogenic fungi.

This two year field study was undertaken on sugarcane-sugarbeet intercropping with the main objective to cover-up the growth as well as yield losses through improved nutrient management, ultimately for the highest economic output. Randomized complete block design with two factorial arrangements and four replications was adopted for experimental layout. Factor-1 treatments in main-plots comprised of sole cultivation of sugarcane and sugarbeet as well as intercropping of both. Sugarbeet was intercropped on 90 cm spaced ridges between rows of sugarcane being the main crop. Factor-2 in sub-plots included various levels of NPK fertilizers, viz., F-0, F-100, F-150, F-200, F-250 and F-300, representing 0, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 kg ha(-1), respectively, each of N-P2O5-K2O. Data on crop growth and yield attributes reflected statistically higher values for sole planting in control and with lower NPK doses; however, there was non-significant difference between intercropping and sole cultivation system of sugarcane and sugarbeet at higher NPK doses. Number and height of shoots, dry shoots weight, cane length and diameter, crop growth rate and un-stripped cane yield increased significantly with each increment of NPK level.

J	"Xie, Y; Kristensen, HL"				"Xie, Yue; Kristensen, Hanne Lakkenborg"			Intercropping leek (Allium porrum L.) with dyer's woad (Isatis tinctoria L.) increases rooted zone and agro-ecosystem retention of nitrogen	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"Intercropping; Organic leek; Soil N-inorg; Root distribution; Competition"	"WINTER-WHEAT; CROP YIELD; CATCH CROP; SOIL LAYERS; GROWTH; COMPETITION; SYSTEM; WATER; FIELD; DENSITY"	Nitrate leaching can be high in organic vegetable production. Late-harvested crops like leek limit the use of autumn catch crops. The aim of this study was to investigate the growing of a combination of a deep-rooted catch crop and a shallow-rooted vegetable to reduce the risk of nitrate leaching. We compared a leek sole crop (S) with two intercropped systems of leek and early-sown dyer's woad (five weeks after leek planting) (IE) or late-sown dyer's woad (eight weeks after leek planting) (IL) in two seasons: 2012 and 2013. To reveal root and resource competition, leek with dyer's woad rows left empty (S-emp), and early and late-sown dyer's woad with leek rows left empty (DEemp, DLemp) were included. Yield, dry above-ground biomass, aboveground N accumulation and soil inorganic N (N-inorg) were measured as well as root growth by use of minirhizotrons to 2.3 m soil depth. Results showed that the marketable yield of leek in IE and IL systems was comparable with the yield in the S system when calculated per length of leek row. The Relative Competition Index (RCI) revealed that interspecific competition facilitated the growth of leek but hampered that of dyer's woad. The rooted zone increased from 0.5 m in the S system to more than 2 m depth in those of the intercropped systems. Dyer's woad ceased growing above ground but kept growing below ground after crop harvest and extended roots under the leek root system in 2012. Intercropping increased the root intensity of late-sown dyer's woad after leek harvest in the 0.75-1.75 m soil layer compared to dyer's woad growing alone (DLemp), while the root depth was not affected. The intercropped system with early-sown dyer's woad reduced soil Ninorg by 52 kg ha(-1) relative to the sole cropped system, and dyer's woad accumulated 48 kg N ha -1 in aboveground biomass at harvest in 2013. Late-sown dyer's woad had fewer roots, left higher soil Ninorg and had lower aboveground N accumulation than early-sown dyer's woad until the following spring. Therefore, early-sown dyer's woad is applicable in an organic intercropped system with high yields of leek to decrease the risk of nitrate leaching. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, a mildew-index-model-based cluster analysis was used to evaluate and identify groups of soybean genotypes with different organ-specific resistance against field mold. The constituents of soybean pods, including proteins, carbohydrates, fatty acids, and isoflavones, were analyzed. Linear regression and correlation analyses were also conducted between these main pod constituents and the organ-specific mildew indexes of seed (MIS) and pod (MIP). With increases in the contents of infection constituents, such as proteins, carbohydrates, and fatty acids, the MIP increased and the MIS decreased. The MIS decreased with increases in the contents of glycitein (GLE)-type isoflavonoids, which act as antibiotic constituents. Although the infection constituents in the soybean pods caused pod mildew, they also helped mitigate the corresponding seed mildew to a certain extent.

Treatment comprised two different doses of quizalofop-ethyl, imazethapyr and chlorimuron-p-ethyl along with pendimethalin and manual weeding. Cyperus rotundus, Anagallis arvensis, Chenopodium album, Polygonum plebejum and Phalaris minor were the dominant weeds. Cyperus rotundus was the most dominant weeds with highest relative density and relative dry weight. The toxic effect of imazethapyr and chlorimuron was recorded on both chickpea and mustard. Among herbicide treatments, significantly lowest weed density and weed dry weight and highest weed control efficiency, weed control index, nodule specific weight and plant dry matter were recorded in quizalofop-ethyl @60 g/ha. Similarly, higher chickpea and mustard yield, system productivity, net return and B/C ratio were recorded in quizalofop-ethyl @ 60 g/ha and manual weeding.	"[Kumar, Narendra; Hazra, K. K.; Yadav, S.

The objective of this study was to determine the weed-suppressing effect of fenugreek intercropped with coriander, with the aim to select a suitable density of fenugreek for intercropping in coriander production. Five fenugreek densities and three weed control levels were evaluated in a factorial arrangement of treatments. Results indicated that increasing density of fenugreek living mulch suppressed weed growth and increased seed yield compared to weed infested conditions. Maximum weed biomass was recorded in sole coriander with no control (329 and 274 g m(-2) in 2012 and 2013, respectively), while minimum weed biomass was recorded in plots which fenugreek intercropped at the density of 50 plants m(-2) and one hand weeding was applied. Increasing fenugreek density decreased the LAI of coriander with similar gentle slopes for both years. The seed yields obtained from weed free, one hand weeding, and no control plots were 1618, 973, and 457 kg ha(-1), respectively. With increase in weed control level fenugreek density caused a decrease with greater impact on the coriander seed yield. Essential oil content from dried fruit ranged from 0.52 to 1.14% and 0.52 to 1.10% in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Our findings confirm that fenugreek can be used as living mulch in organic coriander production to reduce the biomass of weeds. However, the use of fenugreek did not provide reliable weed control throughout the season and so must be combined with additional weed management options to achieve acceptable control.

However, a rapid decline of intercropping can be observed in the last decades. The present paper investigates the reason for this development and suggests solutions on how to adjust intercropping systems to fit modern agriculture. Firstly, the developments of socioeconomic conditions for farming were assessed, analyzing the statistical yearbooks of the seven provinces of the North China Plain. Secondly, a survey was conducted in the study region to understand the current state and future of intercropping systems. The investigations revealed that, due to limited off-farm income possibilities in the past, intercropping has been a viable solution to intensively use the limited land resources per farm household. However, a shift of rural laborers into other sectors has recently been observed. Thus, decreasing importance of income from agriculture and increasing labor costs are heralding the slow death of labor-intensive intercropping systems. Two possible solutions are discussed in the paper. Either the traditional row-intercropping systems can be transformed into strip-intercropping systems that can be mechanized using existing machinery; or, new machinery has to be developed that enables the mechanization of the traditional row-intercropping systems."

However, no research has tried turfgrass as living mulch for field vegetable crops. In this study, several field experiments were conducted with tomato crops stripe-cultivated with turfgrass and the intercropped tomato crops showed high resistance against leaf blights resulting in improved fruit yield and quality. Lower nitrate concentration in tomato leaves stripe-cultivated with turfgrass might be one of the reasons for decreased risk of fungal infection. Turfgrass root is alive with high activity throughout the year and the root is colonized and mutually benefiting from each other with mycorrhizae. The mycorrhizal colonization was high in turfgrass roots, and also much higher in roots of tomato plants with turfgrass as living mulch than in the tomato plants without living mulch. This might be another reason for decreased infection risk of fungi. In conclusion, as living mulch, an annually ever living turfgrass with its root system colonized by mycorrhizae, making a living soil and improving soil conditions, avoided the infection by soil-borne pathogens in tomato plants that are stripe-cultivated with turfgrass.

The experimental design was a split-split plot with randomized complete block design with three replications. Accordingly, three levels of N (0, 35 and 70 kg ha(-1)) in main plots, two planting dates of berseem clover (coincident with main crop harvest and 40 days after it) in sub plots and two harvesting heights (10 and 40 cm above the soil surface) in sub-sub plots were laid out. The application of 70 kg N ha(-1) and short harvest height (10 cm) yielded the highest ratoon rice grain, ratoon days to 50% heading and harvest index. The best biological yield was obtained from higher harvest height as well. Qualitative traits such as gelatinization temperature (GT) and protein content (PC) increased with large amount of N. But amylose content (AC) and gel consistency (GC) were not affected by experimental treatments. Effect of nitrogen and harvest height on fresh and dry weight of both cuts, protein content in the first cutting and total land equivalent ratio (LER) were significant at 1% level. The highest fresh and dry weight yield was obtained by application of 35 kg N ha(-1). The highest protein and total LER obtained from higher N application (70 kg N ha(-1)).

Populations of adults, the female:male sex ratios and the densities of larval mines were significantly higher in pepper monoculture than in intercropping in a 2:2 pattern (2 rows of pepper to 2 rows of sugarcane), which in turn were significantly higher than intercropping in a 1:2 pattern (1 row of pepper to 2 rows of sugarcane). The densities of the parasitoids of the leafminer were significantly higher in intercropping than in the pepper monoculture. The total parasitism rates were 71.6%, 22.5% and 5.9% in 2007, and 69.5%, 20.6% and 5.9% in 2008, in the 1:2, 2:2 and pepper monoculture, respectively. The lower densities of leafminer adults, the lower female:male sex ratio, and smaller numbers of larval mines in the intercropping systems were attributed to the intercropping pattern and the growth of pepper. These results indicate that intercropping is suitable for the control of L. huidobrensis on pepper plants. These results demonstrate the utility of intercropping of pepper with sugarcane in the management of L. huidobrensis. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A multiple criteria decision analysis is thus needed to evaluate and rate various cropping systems in different soil and climate conditions. Different intercrop management plans in vineyards were analysed in this study so as to classify them in relation to their ability to fulfil a particular set of objectives and to deal with climatic variability. The method included five steps. A set of intercrop management plans was defined by combining the type of grass, the covered soil surface ratio, and the intercropping duration. Four evaluation criteria were chosen: grapevine vegetative development, yield, product quality and runoff. Corresponding indicators were identified and the range of values that would be desirable or not were defined. A water balance model designed for row crops was run to simulate the behaviour of the grapevine-intercrop-soil system under different management plans and at various soil depths. The model was used to calculate, for each management plan and soil depth, the four indicators and evaluate the overall agreement and discordance with various weights assigned to the four criteria. A frequency analysis on 30 years of weather data was carried out to estimate the robustness of the most satisfactory intercrop management plans. The most satisfactory intercrop management plans differed according to the priority given to managing production or reducing environmental impacts and depended on the soil depth. This confirms the conclusions drawn on the basis of various experiments assessing a limited range of intercropping policies. Overall, giving priority to the environmental criterion was favourable for cropping systems with a long intercrop period regardless of the soil type. Few management plans were suitable for all years. The observed yearly rainfall varied from 330 to 1200 mm during the 1975-2003 period, which generated marked variations in the water balance of the grapevine-intercrop-soil system. The lack of robustness of the explored intercrop management plans could be a consequence of the poor description of the management plans due to the limited combinations of technical options considered. Strategic or tactical adjustments could be introduced by farmers. We assume that more robust intercrop management plans could be developed by introducing such rules in a decision model combined with the present biophysical model. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the effects of intercropping and intercropping-rhizobial inoculation on soil enzyme activities, microbial biomass and bacterial community composition in the rhizosphere were examined. In both treatments, the yield of alfalfa, microbial biomass and activities of soil urease, invertase and alkaline phosphatase in the alfalfa rhizosphere were markedly increased, whereas there was a slight increase in the yield of Siberian wild rye, few impacts on soil microbial biomass, and decreased enzyme activities (except for urease) in the Siberian wild rye rhizosphere. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of 16S rRNA genes indicated that Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the major bacterial groups in the rhizosphere of both plants. However, intercropping and rhizobial inoculation induced some shifts in the relative abundance of them. Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira groups were detected in all treatments by the T-RFLP patterns of ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA) gene, but the relative abundance of Nitrosomonas increased and that of Nitrosospira decreased in the intercropping-rhizobial inoculation treatment. Both treatments tended to increase the diversity of amoA. Conclusively, the two treatments clearly affected soil microbial composition and soil enzyme activities, which might be reflected in changes in yield.

The sole and intercropping was compared based on the aboveground biomass, water use efficiency (WUE), soil organic matter (SOM) and total nitrogen (TN), and root biomass and distribution. The aboveground biomass production was measured every year at the end of growth seasons in 2001-2005. Root biomass and vertical distribution were studied only in 2005. Topsoil SOM and TN contents were measured discontinuously during the study period. Results showed that intercropping reduced the aboveground biomass production of sainfoin significantly compared with its pure stand. The WUE of sole switchgrass was significantly the highest in each year among the three stands, while the intercropped stand was significantly higher than sole sainfoin on five-year averaged. The aggressivity of sainfoin to swichgrass decreased along with the growth years. Before 2005, the land equivalent ratio (LER) was bigger than 1.0 and actual yield loss (AYL) was positive. Under intercropping, root biomass input and root: shoot ratio in switchgrass reduced, while sainfoin inputs more photosynthate to root growth. Switchgrass had high root biomass and wide distribution vertically and horizontally indicates a higher belowground competitive ability in the mixture. It indicated a flexible distribution strategy of switchgrass tending to increase soil exploitation and space sequestration efficiency in soil layers. SOM and TN increased significantly for the three stands at the end of the fourth growth year, especially for the mixture. Switchgrass and sainfoin intercropped under 2: 1 row-replacement can be a short-term rotation tillage choice with respect to soil management in the area.

Switchgrass and milkvetch intercropping under 2 : 1 row-replacement in semiarid region, northwest China: Aboveground biomass and water use efficiency	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						"aboveground biomass; actual yield loss (AYL); aggressivity (A); intercropping; land equivalent ratio (LER); milkvetch; switchgrass"	"SOIL-WATER; PANICUM-VIRGATUM; SYSTEMS; YIELD; COMPETITION; WHEAT; GROWTH; PRODUCTIVITY; DYNAMICS; CHICKPEA"	An experiment was conducted to investigate the aboveground biomass and water use characteristics of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and milkvetch (Astragalus adsurgens Pall.) in solecropping and 2:1 row-replacement intercropping in semiarid region on the Loess Plateau of China. Field experiments were conducted during the growing seasons from 2001 to 2005. The aboveground biomass production, considering the sum of dry litter and standing parts, was measured every year at the end of growth season. The aboveground biomass, soil water content dynamics, water use efficiency (WUE), actual yield loss (AYL), land equivalent ratio (LER) and aggressivity (A) were compared under sole and intercropping. Intercropping reduced the biomass production of the two component plants, compared with their respective pure stands. Milkvetch was the dominant species in the intercropping in 2001-2004, however its aggressivity to swichgrass decreased gradually as the growth years progressed, and in 2005 it became the dominant in the mixture. The equivalent biomass production under intercropping and whole WUE of mixture were significantly lower than their respective solecropping, although LER of the mixture was equal or bigger than 0. It is concluded that there was no advantage of growing switchgrass and milkvetch under 2:1 row-replacement in semiarid hilly-gully region of Loess Plateau if total biomass production is the primary purpose.

An undersown crop can also compete with the main crop. Seventeen plant species were undersown in spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) to study their suitability regarding establishment, biomass production, competition with the main crop and effects on soil mineral N. Three different seeding rates were evaluated. Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) decreased nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) content in late autumn and timothy (Phleum pratense L.) in the succeeding spring. A mixture was optimal to reduce N leaching. Italian ryegrass is a very competitive species that should be undersown at moderate seeding rates to avoid large yield reduction in the main crop. Black medic (Medicago lupulina L.) slightly increased N leaching risk, but red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) did not increase soil NO3-N content. As clovers did not compete strongly with the main crop, fairly high seeding rates can be used to maximise N fixation to benefit the successive crop. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Early generation selection for high yielding cowpea genotypes in additive series intercropping systems with sorghum	ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY			English	Article						"additive series intercropping; cowpea; early generation selection; parent-offspring regression"	"PEARL-MILLET; SOLE-CROP; CULTIVARS; ENVIRONMENT; STABILITY; WEST"	Defining appropriate selection strategies for developing cowpea varieties adapted to additive series intercropping systems is an important requirement for cowpea breeders and producers in sub-Saharan Africa. One hundred and forty-three F-2:3 cowpea families and their subsequent 99 F-3:4 families derived from a cross between a sole bred cultivar, Apagbaala, and a traditional variety, SARC-L02, were evaluated under additive series intercropping with sorghum. Intercropping imposed a strong selection pressure for days to flowering such that 31% of F-2:3 families that flowered after 50 days produced too few grains to permit their subsequent evaluation in the F-3:4 generation. Narrow-sense heritabilities estimated by parent-offspring regression were high for 100 seed weight and days to flowering, moderate for biomass, low for grain yield and insignificant for branches/plant and pods/plant. Retrospective selection at 40% intensity based on F-3 grain yield recovered 5 of the 10 top yielding families in the F-4. No significant difference was observed between mean grain yield of selected and rejected families (at the 40% selection intensity) as estimated by a t-test. Sole and intercrop yields produced by six advanced breeding lines included as controls showed poor correlation, and suggests selecting cultivars under the target cropping system will produce better selection response.

J	"Bielders, CL; Michels, K"				"Bielders, CL; Michels, K"			On-farm evaluation of ridging and residue management options in a Sahelian millet-cowpea intercrop. 2. Crop development	SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						"Sahel; tillage; mulches; intercropping; rotations; crop yield; available water"	"WIND EROSION CONTROL; WEST-AFRICAN SAHEL; ACID SANDY SOIL; PEARL-MILLET; LONG-TERM; PHOSPHORUS FERTILIZATION; GROWTH; NIGER; TILLAGE; WATER"	In the Sahel, promising technologies for agricultural intensification include millet stover mulching and ridging. A four year on-farm experiment was set-up in order to assess the effect of various combinations of these two technologies on crop development and yield in a millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.) - cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) intercropping system. Treatments included bare surface, ridging, a surface applied banded millet stover mulch (2 t ha(-1)) and a banded millet stover mulch (2 t ha(-1)) buried in ridges. The latter three treatments were implemented exclusively in the cowpea rows, with an annual rotation between the millet and cowpea rows. On bare and ridged plots, millet yields fell below 100 kg grain ha-1 after the first year. This was ascribed mainly to soil acidification and loss of soil organic, matter rather than to soil physical constraints or water availability despite extensive surface crusting and high soil penetration resistance and bulk density. Compared to the bare plots, ridging increased cowpea hay production by 330% over the four years which was attributed to lower soil penetration resistance and bulk density but also to a reduction of 0.15 cmol(+)kg(-1) exchangeable acidity in the ridges. Except during the severe drought year of 1997, millet grain yield in the banded mulch treatment remained fairly stable over time at 526 +/- 9 kg ha(-1). However, a detailed analysis revealed yield compensation mechanisms between various yield components depending on the timing of occurrence of the abiotic stresses. Cowpea productivity was always higher in buried banded mulch plots than in surface applied banded mulch plots but the former treatment appeared unable to sustain millet yields. This decline was attributed to a greater nutrient uptake by cowpea and more rapid acidification in the buried mulch treatment compared to the banded mulch treatment.

Three genotypes, viz 'BG 256', 'KPG 59' and 'KWR 108' of gram were intercropped with 'Neelam' linseed under 2 : 1, 4 : 2 and 6 : 2 row arrangement (chickpca : linseed) in replacement systems. 'KWR 108' gram gave the highest seed yield of 2 406 kg/ha in its sole stand, registering an advantage of 403 and 484 kg/ha over XPG 59' and 'BG 256' respectively. However, in intercropping 'BG 256' proved more compatible than 'KPG 59 'and 'KWR 108'. The highest productivity of 2 601 kg/ha (chickpea equivalent) was noticed in 'BG 256' + 'Neclam'under 6 : 2 planting pattern. A planting pattern of 6 : 2 row arrangement was most promising. The monetary return and benefit: cost ratio were also highest in the same combination. The highest monetary advantage (Rs 6 253/ha) and income-equivalent ratio (1,57) were found in 'BG 256' + 'Neelam' under 6 : 2 planting pattern, indicating the superiority of the system to others. Higher land-equivalent ratio and area-time equivalent ratio in this combination revealed efficient utilization of land space and time. Linseed showed more advantage in intercropping, having higher aggressivity and relative crowding coefficient. The higher competition ratio of linseed showed its more competitiveness in the system.

Under a system of different intercropped fruit trees, the cultivation of coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) intercropped with guava (Psidium guajava L.) enhanced the soil microbial activity approximately 2-fold after 38 yrs over 10 yrs of the same intercropped system. Soil organic carbon increased from 3.4 to 7.8 and 2.4 to 6.2 g kg(-1) after 38 and 10 yrs, respectively, following the establishment of orchards. The increase was attributed to greater recycling of bio-litters. Levels of dehydrogenase, phosphatase and soil microbial biomass under field conditions generally depended more on the nature of the cropping system than on soil types. Similarly, average carbon inputs of bio-litter to the soil in monocrop (0.98 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) was less than intercropped fruit trees (2.07 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)). The average level of soil microbial biomass carbon was 1158 kg ha(-1) (0-0.15 m depth) and the organic carbon turnover rate was 8.5 yr(-1) after 38 yrs of intercropped fruit trees, which resulted in a lower ratio (1.81) of carbon inputs to soil microbial biomass carbon.

We examined the effect of time of N application on dry matter (DM) and grain yield (GY), N accumulation, the N budget in crop from soil, fertilizer and atmosphere, and the fertilizer N use efficiency (estimated by the conventional difference method, and the direct N-15 recovery by the crops), in a sorghum/pigeonpea intercropping system on an Alfisol (Ferric Luvisols (FAO); or Udic Rhodustalf (USDA) in India. Fertilizer N was applied at planting (basal) and at 40 days after sowing (delayed). Nitrogen was applied only to the sorghum rows in the intercropping treatment. Nitrogen derived from air (N-dfa) was estimated by the N-15 natural abundance method, and N derived from fertilizer (N-dff) was estimated by the N-15 isotope dilution method. Delaying N fertilization till 40 days after sowing (DAS), rather than applying at sowing increased DM and GY of the sorghum, but not of pigeonpea. Delaying N fertilization to sorghum for 40 days significantly (p<0.001) increased N-15 recovery in shoot from 15 to 32% in sole crop, and from 10 to 32% in intercrop. Similarly, there was a significant (p<0.001) increase in N recovery (by the difference method) from 43 to 59% in sole crop and from 28 to 71 % in intercrop sorghum. Fertilizer N recovery by sole crop pigeonpea (14%) was higher than intercrop pigeonpea (2-4%). Pigeonpea fixed between 120-170 kg ha(-1) of atmospheric N throughout the cropping season. Although there was a marked difference in nitrate-N (NO3-N) concentrations between basal and delayed treatments at planting, no difference was observed in NO3-N concentrations in soil solution between the treatments at 40 DAS. Our data on N accumulation by plants showed that the rate of N depletion or disappearance from the soil solution was 2-3 times faster than N accumulation by plants, suggesting that an appreciable amount of NO3-N would disappear from soil solution in the top soil without being utilized by crops during the initial growth stage."

Therefore, field experiments were conducted on a Decatur silty loam (Rhodic Paleudult) soil to evaluate the effects of N and intercropping methods on grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) with common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and soya bean (Glycine max L.). Four N rates (0, 33, 66, 99 kg ha(-1)) were utilized on sorghum interplanted, in alternate rows or alternating plants within rows, with common bean and soya bean. A sole planting (pure stand) of each species was added as a control treatment. Grain sorghum yield when intercropped with common bean and soya bean was 112% and 91% of the sole planting yield, respectively. Yields of intercropped soya bean and common bean were 90% and 68% of their respective sole plantings. The yield difference between intercrop and sole crop sorghum became less as N rates increased. Sorghum yields and common bean responded positively to an increase in N from 0 to 99 kg ha(-1). Efficiency of production from intercropped treatments, as measured by the land equivalent ratio, was significantly higher (1.83) than sole plantings.

Generally, intercropping depressed the performance of sorghum more than sunflower. Sorghum plants grown in alternate hills with sunflower had the shortest stems, the least dry matter and total seed yields per hectare, while the highest dry matter and seed yields were obtained from sorghum planted in five alternating rows with sunflower. Similarly, in sunflower, plants grown in five alternating rows with sorghum had the highest yields compared with other planting patterns, but there were no significant differences in the dry matter and total seed yields of sorghum and sunflower intercropped in three and five alternating rows. Light transmission, leaf area index and yields of both crops followed similar trends under the various planting patterns. Interplanting in five alternating rows that allowed the highest leaf area also allowed the lowest light transmission and produced the highest yields. Land use efficiency was highly improved under three and five rows interplanting by 52 and 74 % respectively.

Walp.) cultivars with management factors and environments was analyzed in terms of parameters of a simple physiological model. In one set of experiments seven cultivars were sown at three rates of phosphorus (P) fertilizer (0, 8 and 16 kg P ha-1). In another set, five cultivars were sown on two dates relative to sowing of millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R.Br.). All experiments involved factorial combinations of management and cultivar treatments, and were conducted in 1988 and 1989 at two sites in western Niger. Seed yield, shoot dry matter, vegetative (D(v)) and reproductive (D(r)) durations were determined and crop growth rate (C) and partitioning (p) to seed estimated. Application of P increased seed yield by increasing C. As sowing was delayed from 1 to 3 weeks after the millet was sown, there was a reduction in seed yield due to decreases in C. D(v) and D(r). Variation in cultivar performance across years was mainly a function of C and partitioning. In both experiments the C of the landrace Sadore Local was greater than that of other cultivars, although the partitioning to seed of this cultivar was unstable due to variable control of insect pest damage. It is concluded that the primary causes of G X E interactions were differential canopy development and insect damage effects. Therefore in the development of cowpea cultivars for intercropping with millet, emphasis should focus on light capture capabilities. Improved yields would then seem possible with most cultivars, providing insect damage is controlled.

The alfalfa treatments included complete killing (glyphosate only), glyphosate injury + cutting, and cutting only, with alfalfa shoot residue returned to the soil surface in all three treatments. Corn was planted in each pot following application of the treatments. When alfalfa was suppressed by glyphosate injury + cutting, corn had recovered 12% of the alfalfa N by 8 weeks of growth, but with cutting only, N recovery by corn was reduced to 4.0%. The complete-kill treatment resulted in 8% recovery by corn of alfalfa N. In all treatments, most of the alfalfa-N remained in the soil organic pool. A second experiment tested a cutting only treatment with N-15-labeled alfalfa residue returned to the soil surface. The N-15-labeled alfalfa residue contributed 4.1% of N to corn during the 8-week growth cycle. Twice as much N-15 was found in the active microbial biomass pool in the two treatments with live intercropped plants compared to the monoculture treatments with complete killing (non-intercropped) and the control treatment of alfalfa regrowth only. An analysis of the change in the N-15 content of the undisturbed alfalfa roots from just before the suppression until 8 weeks later suggested that approximately 80% of the root N-15 was lost from the plant suppressed by cutting. This corresponds to 28% of the total N released from the alfalfa. The results suggest that the degree of legume suppression was a key factor in the availability of legume N to the second crop. When the two species were intercropped, more of the N available from legume residues went to plant uptake and microbial biomass and was not stabilized as quickly in the soil organic pool. Appropriate management schemes must be designed to increase N availability to the second crop without yield reduction. These studies suggest severe suppression is necessary; if successful, more of the N can be maintained in active pools."

Crop rotation resulted in emerged weed densities in test crops that were lower in 21 cases, higher in 1 case, and equivalent in 5 cases in comparison to monoculture systems. In 12 cases where weed seed density was reported, seed density in crop rotation was lower in 9 cases and equivalent in 3 cases when compared to monocultures of the component crops. In intercropping systems where a main crop was intersown with a ''smother'' crop species, weed biomass in the intercrop was lower in 47 cases and higher in 4 cases than in the main crop grown alone (as a sole crop); a variable response was observed in 3 cases. When intercrops were composed of two or more main crops, weed biomass in the intercrop was lower than in all of the component sole crops in 12 cases, intermediate between component sole crops in 10 cases, and higher than all sole crops in 2 cases. It is unclear why crop rotation studies have focused on weed density, whereas intercropping studies have focused on weed biomass. The success of rotation systems for weed suppression appears to be based on the use of crop sequences that create varying patterns of resource competition, allelopathic interference, soil disturbance, and mechanical damage to provide an unstable and frequently inhospitable environment that prevents the proliferation of a particular. weed species. The relative importance and most effective combinations of these weed control tactics have not been adequately assessed. In addition, the weed-suppressive effects of other related factors, such as manipulation of soil fertility dynamics in rotation sequences, need to be examined. Intercrops may demonstrate weed control advantages over sole crops in two ways. First, greater crop yield and less weed growth may be achieved if intercrops are more effective than sole crops in usurping resources from weeds or suppressing weed growth through allelopathy. Alternatively, intercrops may provide yield advantages without suppressing weed growth below levels observed in component sole crops if intercrops use resources that are not exploitable by weeds or convert resources to harvestable material more efficiently than sole crops. Because of the difficulty of monitoring the use of multiple resources by intercrop/weed mixtures throughout the growing season, identification of specific mechanisms of weed suppression and yield enhancement in intercrop systems has so far proven elusive. Significant advances in the design and improvement of weed-suppressive crop rotation and intercropping systems are most likely to occur if three important areas of research are addressed. First, there must be continued attention to the study of weed population dynamics and crop-weed interference in crop rotation and intercropping systems. More information is needed concerning the effects of diversification of cropping systems on weed seed longevity, weed seedling emergence, weed seed production and dormancy, agents of weed mortality, differential resource consumption by crops and weeds, and allelopathic interactions. Second, there needs to be systematic manipulation of specific components of rotation and intercropping systems to isolate and improve those elements (e.g., interrow cultivation, choice of crop genotype) or combinations of elements that may be especially important for weed control. Finally, the weed-related impacts of combining crop rotation and intercropping strategies should be assessed through careful study of extant, complex farming systems and the design and testing of new integrated approaches. Many aspects of crop rotation and intercropping are compatible with current farming practices and could become more accessible to farmers if government policies are restructured to reflect the true environmental costs of agricultural production."

In this study, the influence of various CAPS in a corn-legumes systems on key physiological parameters of corn such as leaf area index (LAI), net assimilation ratio (NAR), dry matter yield (DMY), harvest index (HI) and grain yield (GY) were evaluated at various crop stages (30, 60, 85 days after planting and at harvest) , in two cropping seasons, respectively. Five corn-based cropping systems (CS), namely: CSI (corn + Arachis pintoi - Corn + A. pintoi), CS2 (corn + Stylosanthes guianensis - Corn + S. guianensis), CS3 (corn + cowpea - upland rice + cowpea), CS4 (corn + rice bean - Corn + Rice bean) and CS5 (corn - corn), were employed as treatments. LAI, DMY, HI and GY were significantly influenced by the various imposed CAPS relative to the control (CS5, sole corn). However, recorded NAR values showed to be higher in CS5 (sole corn). Highest GY was obtained in CS2 (4.26 t ha(-1)) as the mean for the 2-cropping seasons. Among the CAPS, the used of A. pintoi and rice bean proved to be a promising associated legumes species to complement the base crop. Results of the study, provides the initial merits of adoption of CAPS in Northern Mindanao within the context of productivity, profitability and resiliency amidst a changing climate.

Intercropping with T. erecta or B. pilosa promoted the growth of C. betacea seedlings compared with the monoculture, while intercropping with S. photeinocarpum or G. parvifiora inhibited that. Intercropping with S. photeinocarpum decreased the Cd contents in the roots and shoots of C. betacea seedlings compared with the monoculture, but intercropping with the other plants did not. In the straw mulch experiment, the straw of S. photeinocarpum or T. erecta promoted the growth of C. betacea seedlings compared with the control, while the straw of G. parvifiora or B. pilosa did not. The straw of S. photeinocarpum or T. erecta decreased the Cd contents in the shoots of C. betacea seedlings, and the straw of G. parvifiora or B. pilosa increased the shoot Cd contents. Thus, intercropping with S. photeinocarpum and applying S. photeinocarpum or T. erecta straw can reduce the Cd uptake of C. betacea.

More phylogenetically diverse polycultures inconsistently suppress insect herbivore populations	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						"Associational resistance; Intercropping; IPM; Natural enemies; Phylogeny"	"ACALYMMA-VITTATUM COLEOPTERA; INTEGRATED PEST-MANAGEMENT; PLANT; VOLATILE; AGRICULTURE; ATTRACTION; CROPS; MAIZE; PERFORMANCE; INTERCROPS"	Because the diet of many herbivorous insects is restricted to closely related taxa with similar chemistry, intercropping with diverse plant communities may reduce both pest populations and reliance on chemical pesticides in agroecosystems. We tested whether the effectiveness of intercropping against herbivorous insects depends on the phylogenetic relatedness of neighboring crops, using butternut squash (Cucurbita moschata) as a focal crop species in a series of different intercropping combinations. We found that increased phylogenetic divergence of neighboring plants could reduce abundance of herbivorous insects, but the effect was only detectable mid-season. In addition, we tested two hypothesized mechanisms for a negative association between phylogenetic distance of neighboring plants and reduced herbivore populations: one, we tested using Y-tube olfactometer and choice cage trials whether diverse volatile cues impede host-plant location by the dominant pest of butternut squash in our experiment, striped cucumber beetle Acalymma vittatum. Two, we recorded predator and parasitoid abundance relative to crop phylodiversity to test whether diverse crops support larger natural-enemy populations that can better control pest species. Our results, however, did not support either hypothesis. Striped cucumber beetles preferentially oriented toward non-host-plant volatiles, and predator populations more often decreased with phylodiversity than increased. Thus, the mechanisms driving associations in the field between phylogenetic divergence and herbivore populations remain unclear.

Image-based 3D canopy reconstruction to determine potential productivity in complex multi-species crop systems	ANNALS OF BOTANY			English	Article						"3D reconstruction; Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc.); canopy architecture; canopy productivity; intercropping; light interception; photosynthesis; proso millet (Panicum miliaceum); ray tracing"	"LIGHT INTERCEPTION; CARBON GAIN; RESOURCE USE; PLANT ARCHITECTURE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; MODEL; ACCLIMATION; INTERCROP; MAIZE; COMPETITION"	Background and Aims Intercropping systems contain two or more species simultaneously in close proximity. Due to contrasting features of the component crops, quantification of the light environment and photosynthetic productivity is extremely difficult. However it is an essential component of productivity. Here, a low-tech but high-resolution method is presented that can be applied to single-and multi-species cropping systems to facilitate characterization of the light environment. Different row layouts of an intercrop consisting of Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea) and proso millet (Panicum miliaceum) have been used as an example and the new opportunities presented by this approach have been analysed. Methods Three-dimensional plant reconstruction, based on stereo cameras, combined with ray tracing was implemented to explore the light environment within the Bambara groundnut-proso millet intercropping system and associated monocrops. Gas exchange data were used to predict the total carbon gain of each component crop. Key Results The shading influence of the tall proso millet on the shorter Bambara groundnut results in a reduction in total canopy light interception and carbon gain. However, the increased leaf area index (LAI) of proso millet, higher photosynthetic potential due to the C4 pathway and sub-optimal photosynthetic acclimation of Bambara groundnut to shade means that increasing the number of rows of millet will lead to greater light interception and carbon gain per unit ground area, despite Bambara groundnut intercepting more light per unit leaf area. Conclusions Three-dimensional reconstruction combined with ray tracing provides a novel, accurate method of exploring the light environment within an intercrop that does not require difficult measurements of light interception and data-intensive manual reconstruction, especially for such systems with inherently high spatial possibilities. It provides new opportunities for calculating potential productivity within multi-species cropping systems, enables the quantification of dynamic physiological differences between crops grown as monoculture and those within intercrops, and enables the prediction of new productive combinations of previously untested crops.

J	Padi, FK				Padi, Francis Kwame			Genotype x environment interaction and yield stability in a cowpea-based cropping system	EUPHYTICA			English	Article						"cowpea; genotype x environment interaction; intercropping; stability"	"GRAIN-YIELD; SOLE-CROP; ADAPTATION; TOLERANCE; CULTIVARS; SELECTION; TRAITS; MAIZE"	Twenty-four cowpea genotypes were evaluated under sole cropping or additive series intercropping with sorghum from 2004 to 2005 at four sites representative of the Guinea and Sudan savannah ecologies in Ghana. The aim was to determine whether cowpea breeding programs that emphasize selection under sole-crop conditions have the potential to produce cultivars that are effective under additive series intercropping. Genotype xcropping systems interaction was significant for days to 50% flowering but not for grain yield, biomass and other studied traits. Genotypic yield reaction to cropping systems indicated that bridging the yield gap between sole cropping and intercropping systems is best addressed by agronomic interventions that reduce stress on intercrop cowpea rather than by selecting for specifically adapted genotypes for intercropping. Significant genotype x environment interactions were observed for all traits when data was pooled over cropping systems. Partitioning of the genotype xenvironment interaction variance indicated that days to 50% flowering was dominated by heterogeneity of genotypic variance, whereas genotype xenvironment interactions for grain yield and biomass was mainly due to imperfect correlations. Large differences in genotypic yield stability were observed as estimated by the among-environment variance, regression of yield on the environmental index, Kataoka's index, and by partitioning of genotype x environment interaction sum of squares into components attributable to each genotype. The results suggest that in regions where genotype x environment interaction for yield frequently causes re-ranking across environments, genotypes with the least contribution to the interaction sum of squares are likely to be most productive. On the whole, the results support the contention that breeding under sole-crop conditions has the potential to produce cultivars effective under intercropping conditions.

Root traits with team benefits: understanding belowground interactions in intercropping systems	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Review						"Complementarity; Disease suppression; Facilitation; Niche differentiation; Nutrient uptake; Root distribution; Root-root interactions; Selection effects; Trait plasticity"	"MAIZE ZEA-MAYS; TRITICUM-AESTIVUM L.; SOIL-PHOSPHORUS AVAILABILITY; FLY DELIA-FLORALIS; VICIA-FABA L.; HYDRAULIC LIFT; INTERSPECIFIC FACILITATION; NITROGEN-FIXATION; USE EFFICIENCY; NON-LEGUME"	Background The potential benefits of intercropping are manifold and have been repeatedly demonstrated. Intercropping has the potential to create more productive and resilient agroecosystems, by improving land utilisation, yield and yield stability, soil quality, and pest, disease and weed suppression. Despite these potential benefits, significant gaps remain in the understanding of ecological mechanisms that govern the outcomes when crop species are grown together. A major part of plant-plant interactions takes place belowground and these are often overlooked. Scope This review synthesises current evidence for belowground plant-plant interactions of competition, niche differentiation and facilitation, with the aim of identifying root traits that influence the processes contributing to enhanced performance of intercrops compared with monocultures. We identify a suite of potentially complementary root traits for maximising the benefits of intercropping. These traits underpin improved soil exploration, more efficient resource use, and suppression of soil-borne pathogens and pests in intercrops. Conclusion This review brings together understanding of the mechanisms underpinning interactions between intercropped roots, and how root traits and their plasticity can promote positive outcomes. Root trait 'ideotypes' for intercropped partners are identified that could be selected for crop improvement. We highlight the importance of examining belowground interactions and consider both spatial and temporal distribution of roots and rhizosphere mechanisms that aid complementarity through niche differentiation and facilitation. Breeding of crop ideotypes with specific beneficial root traits, combined with considerations for optimal spatio-temporal arrangement and ratios of component crops, are essential next steps to promote the adoption of intercropping as a sustainable farming practice.

Chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) is a deep-rooted species, but the benefits of deep roots to water uptake has not been studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the value of deep roots (>2 m) under topsoil water limitation. Methods Chicory grown in 4 m deep soil-filled rhizotrons was exposed to either topsoil drought or resource competition from the shallow-rooted species ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and black medic (Medicago lupulina L.). The effect on deep water uptake was assessed using non-destructive measurements of roots, soil water and tracers. Results Water uptake occurred below 1.7 m depth in 2016, and below 2.3 m depth in 2017 and contributed significantly to chicory water use. However, neither surface soil drying nor intercropping increased deep water uptake to relieve water deficit in the shoots. Conclusion Chicory benefits from deep-roots during drought events, as it acceses deep soil moisture unavailable to more shallow rooted species, yet deep water uptake was unable to compensate for the reduced topsoil water uptake due to soil drying or crop competition.

Viral diseases were widespread in both seasons but were more severe in the intercropped than in the nonintercropped cowpea. In contrast, scab, rust, and powdery mildew were less common and less severe when cowpea was grown in intercrops. High plant populations favored scab and anthracnose, but viral diseases were more severe under low plant populations. Higher incidence and severity of viral diseases, anthracnose, and scab were recorded during the first (wetter) season than during the second (drier) season. Disease level varied considerably among the common cultivars, but these differences may have been influenced by environmental differences.

A field survey was conducted in the eastern and western Hararghe zones in six districts in the 2019 cropping season to investigate the prevalence and socioeconomic impact of the weed. Random sampling was employed to collect the field and socioeconomic data. Data were collected on Striga counts per meter square and per plant, awareness and impression of farmers, prevalence, management used, severity, and collective actions to manage Striga. The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20. The results showed that two Striga species, Striga hermonthica and Striga asiatica, were observed. However, S. hermonthica was more prevalent than S. asiatica in all the surveyed locations, and its occurrence differed among locations. The maximum levels of S. hermonthica occurrence were recorded at Kile-besidimo (92%), Edobaso (85%), Kufakas (82%), Kotora (80%), Homacho Riana (78%), Bal'ina arba (74%), Dire gudina (72%), Bishan babile (66%), Qufa (65%), Oda Anesso (48%), Ijakechu (45%), Umer kulle (40%), Homacho Eba (38%), and Tofik (35%). Less level of Striga occurrence was recorded at Bareda (29%), Haro Adii (27%), Jiru gemachu (25%), and Homacho dayo (23%) Striga per meter square in assessed fields. S. hermonthica resulted in an estimated yield reduction of 0 to 80% in the surveyed areas. This causes higher economic loss and incurs social instability in the region. According to the farmers, hand weeding, legume intercropping, crop rotation, and resistance varieties were the most popular control measures to reduce Striga infestations. From this survey, it can be concluded that S. hermonthica is easily disseminated by different dispersal mechanisms and the major constraint of sorghum production in both zones. Therefore, it can be recommended that integrated management options be employed to reduce Striga infestation and the socioeconomic impact of Striga in the future.

Inhibition of Aspergillus flavus growth and detoxification of aflatoxin B-1 by the medicinal plant zimmu (Allium sativum L. x Allium cepa L.)	WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						"medicinal plants; detoxification; aflatoxin; Aspergillus flavus; Arachis hypogaea"	"BACTERIAL WILT; ESSENTIAL OILS; RESISTANCE; GENOTYPES; EXTRACTS; MAIZE; CROP"	Aflatoxins are carcinogenic, teratogenic and immunosuppressive secondary metabolites produced by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. Aflatoxin contamination of peanut is one of the most important constraints to peanut production worldwide. In order to develop an eco-friendly method of prevention of A. flavus infection and aflatoxin contamination in peanut, aqueous extracts obtained from leaves of 30 medicinal plants belonging to different families were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of A. flavus in vitro. Among them the leaf extract of zimmu (Allium sativum L. x Allium cepa L.) was the only one that showed antifungal activity against A. flavus and recorded 73% inhibition of A. flavus growth. The antifungal activity of the zimmu extract was significantly decreased upon dialysis with a dialysis membrane having molecular cut off 12 kDa or autoclaving at 121 degrees C for 20 min or boiling at 100 degrees C for 10 min and recorded inhibition of 52, 16 and 21%, respectively. When A. flavus was grown in medium containing zimmu extract the production of aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) was completely inhibited even at a concentration of 0.5%. When AFB(1) was incubated with zimmu extract a complete degradation of AFB(1) was observed 5 days after incubation. When the roots of zimmu were incubated in water containing 70 ng of AFB(1)/ml, a reduction (by 58.5%) in AFB(1) concentration was observed 5 days after incubation. A significant reduction in the population of A. flavus in the soil, kernel infection by A. flavus and aflatoxin contamination in kernels was observed when peanut was intercropped with zimmu. The population of the fungal antagonist, Trichoderma viride in the zimmu-intercropped field increased approximately twofold.

Cultivar mixtures with landraces have traditionally been used by subsistence farmers to keep disease epidemics at low levels. These subsistence farmers Live mainly in developing countries and produce up to 20% of the world's food. Landraces have been a valuable source of disease resistance to them because of their already high adaptations in appropriate agronomic backgrounds. Mixtures with improved varieties are now being advocated as an alternative strategy for disease control in many crops. Wild germplasm are also being used to transfer new and valuable genes of disease resistance to cultivated crops. Continuous efforts are being directed at broadening the genetic base of crops by a search for sources of disease resistance, which remain the most practical and environmentally sound means for the control of most major diseases in agricultural crops.

However, the lack of knowledge on suitable legume species is often identified as the main bottleneck for the successful application of legume living mulches. This study aimed to evaluate the suitability of 12 different legumes for relay intercropping with wheat in two contrasting Mediterranean cereal-based cropping systems respectively characterized by low-input and integrated management. Each legume was monitored from the undersowing in wheat until the following spring and we compared direct drilling to broadcast sowing of legumes. None of the undersown legumes showed a negative effect on the wheat grain yield. Relay intercropping of legumes proved to be an effective solution to control weeds before and after the wheat harvest, provided suitable legumes species are chosen. Suitable legumes reduced the weed biomass up to the 90% during the intercropping and up to 94% in the following spring. On the contrary, legumes such as Trifoliumresupinatum, Viciavillosa, Medicagotruncatula, and Medicagoscutellata boosted weed growth in the following spring in comparison with the control. According to the performance of legumes, Medicagosativa, Trifoliumrepens and Medicagolupulina had the most suitable characteristics for relay intercropping with durum wheat at the Ravenna site, in a highly productive region whereas Medicagosativa, Hedysarumcoronarium and Trifoliumsubterraneum performed better in the low-input system near Pisa, where yields are generally lower. This is the first time that such a diversity in legumes species is tested in the same experiment for relay intercropping under diversified environmental and management conditions. The results of this study can support farmers in selecting the most appropriated legume species for their specific cropping systems and local conditions.

A common practice among organic growers is to undersow clover into a small grain, harvest the grain crop and terminate the clover stand in late fall by moldboard plowing in preparation for a cash crop the following spring. While fall plowing offers excellent clover kill, growers increasingly seek an alternative termination method that reduces tillage intensity and bare winter soil. This study, performed at two sites in Maine, evaluates three clover termination methods for kill efficacy, winter soil cover, spring soil conditions and N uptake and grain yield and protein of a subsequent test crop of hard red spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L., var. Glenn). Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) was intercropped with spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and terminated in late fall by moldboard plowing (PL), skim plowing (SK) or undercutting (UC). A control treatment received no clover and was fall plowed. An additional treatment, winterkilled field peas (WK), was evaluated at one site. SK, UC and WK increased soil cover relative to PL, though UC resulted in low clover kill efficacy in a wet spring and is in need of improved design. Grain yield was higher following red clover compared to the no-clover control at one site, but was unaffected by termination method. At one site, grain crude protein was higher following PL than the other treatments, indicating the possibility for more favorable timing of N availability associated with PL.				mpickoff@gmail.com		"Mallory, Ellen/0000-0001-8962-8854; Pickoff, Margaret/0000-0002-5469-2298"	USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Organic Agriculture Research and Extension Initiative [2015-51300-24153]	USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Organic Agriculture Research and Extension Initiative	This work is based on research supported by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Organic Agriculture Research and Extension Initiative under Agreement no. 2015-51300-24153, Innovative Sowing, Cultivation, and Rotation Strategies to Address Weed, Fertility and Disease Challenges in Organic Food and Feed Grains.

The objective of this study was to quantify the impact of intercropping of the legume sunn hemp (SH; Crotalaria juncea; cv. Ecofix) on the productivity of pearl millet (PM; Pennisetum glaucum; cv. ICMV I707) and biomass sorghum (S; Sorghum bicolor (L.); cv. Triton), with or without nitrogen fertilisation (150 kgNha(-1)). The intercrops were SxSH and PMxSH. Quantitative and qualitative biomass traits were evaluated for each cropping system. Land equivalent ratio (LER) and species evenness were used to evaluate the performance of the intercrops. Across fertilisation levels, average biomass yields in 2018 and 2019 were: 23 and 19 Mg ha(-1) (SxSH), 18 and 17 Mg ha(-1) (PMxSH), 21 and 12 Mg ha(-1) (PM), 24 and 20 Mg ha(-1) (S), and 14 and 13 Mg ha(-1) (SH). Overall, LER showed an increase of 22% in PMxSH and 6% in SxSH over the years. Within the intercrops, S showed a larger competitive effect over SH than PM did; species evenness ranged between 0.56 and 0.67 in SxSH and between 0.89 and 0.92 in PMxSH. Moreover, compared to monocropping, intercropping led to improved qualitative feedstock characteristics for bioenergy applications: intercropped PM showed a higher Si/K ratio (+32%), while intercropped SH showed increased cellulose content (+17%) and reduced N (-39%), Mg (-54%), and Na (-15%) contents.

Conservation agriculture (CA) can delay or minimize moisture stress impacts on crop plants and improve the soil fertility. Hence, a field experiment was conducted at Research Farm of ICAR-Directorate of Groundnut Research, Junagadh, during 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 to evaluate the effects of different CA practices on soil moisture, soil fertility, yield, and profitability of peanut systems. Treatments consisted of four tillage practices in main plots (conventional tillage [CT], minimum tillage [MT], zero tillage [ZT], and rotary tillage [RT]); two residue management practices in sub-plots (residue removal [NR] and residue retention [RR]), and two intercropping systems in sub-sub plots using peanut, pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.], and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) (peanut+pigeonpea [PP] and peanut+cotton [PC]) systems and replicated thrice. Both MT and ZT tillage practices as well as the residue management practice RR improved soil moisture content, soil porosity, soil organic C, nutrient status (mainly at 0-15 cm), and soil enzymatic activities and decreased soil temperature variation and soil penetration resistance. Minimum tillage and RR resulted in higher financial returns over CT and NR, respectively. Among the cropping systems, PP was found more productive and profitable as compared to PC. Thus, in the light black soils of India, MT along with RR seems to be a suitable option particularly during the initial years of shifting to CA to retain soil moisture, improve soil fertility, and provide higher financial returns."

JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						"husked ear yield; income; nitrogen fixation; production efficiency"	"NITROGEN-FIXATION; N-TRANSFER; GROUNDNUT; PEANUT; RICE"	Purpose : Intercropping of baby corn (Zea mays L.) with pulse legumes might improve production efficiency and increase profitability. The objectives of this study were to compare growth, yield and nitrogen uptake of baby corn and pulse legumes in intercropping systems and to determine income from the systems. Research Method : Four treatments consisting of baby corn alone, baby corn with mungbean (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek), baby corn with soybean (Glycine max) and baby corn with crawling cowpea (Vigna unquiculata L. Walp) were assigned in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Findings : All intercropping systems reduced growth and yield of baby corn and the income from the legumes could not reimburse for crop loss. Crawling cowpea was the best legume for intercropping system in term of providing better crop residue for succeeding crops. Among three pulse legumes investigated, cowpea had the highest nitrogen uptake, and its residue may be beneficial to succeeding crops. The reasons for reduction in baby corn yield and the alternative means for intercropping to increase income are discussed. Originality : Intercropping system is generally practiced to increase crop production efficiency. In this study, intercropping baby corn with pulse legumes did not increase income for baby corn growers because baby corn had the highest market price and pulse legumes reduced yield of baby corn.

For this reason, a three-year stationary field experiment was performed at Vytautas Magnus University, Agriculture Academy, Lithuania. Sugar beet was grown continuously with intercropped Persian clover (Trifolium resupinatumL., MC), white mustard (Sinapis albaL., MM) and spring barley (Hordeum vulgareL., MB) as a living mulch. Inter-row loosening (CT) and mulching with ambient weeds (MW) were used as comparative treatments. The results showed that, under minimal fertilization, CT and intercropping increased the average content of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the soil. However, the average content of magnesium was reduced in single cases (MW, MB), and the average content of sulphur was reduced in all cases. Intercropping significantly decreased the yields of sugar beet root-crop, but was mainly neutral in quality terms. The meteorological conditions during experimentation had a weak impact on root-crop quantity and quality. Generally, the practice of sugar beet intercropping requires more detailed research on how to minimize the competition between the sugar beet, living mulch and weeds, and how to balance the nutrition conditions.

Grain legumes fix dinitrogen (N-2) in symbiosis with soil bacteria and use soil N sources, but often less efficient than cereals. Intercropping grain legumes with cereals may be a means of increasing use efficiency of soil N. Here, we estimate the global sole cropped grain legume acquisition of N from soil to approximately 14.2 Tg N year(-1), which corresponds to one-third of the global synthetic fertilizer N use (109 Tg N year(-1)) for all crops, assuming that grain legumes recover on average 40% of the fertilizer N. Published data from grain legume-cereal intercrop experiments, employing stable N-15 isotope methods, have shown that due to competitive interactions and complementary N acquisition in intercrops, the cereals recover a more than proportional share of the soil N sources. As a consequence, the intercropped legume derives more of its N from the atmosphere, compared with when it is grown as legume sole crop. We estimated that the increased N use efficiency in intercropping can reduce the requirements for fossil-based fertilizer N by about 26% on a global scale. In addition, our estimates indicate that if all current grain legume sole crops would instead be intercropped with cereals, a potential net land saving would be achieved, when also replacing part of the current cereal sole crop area with intercropping. Intercropping has additional potential advantages such as increased yield stability and yield per unit area, reduced pest problems and reduced requirements for agrochemicals, while stimulating biodiversity. It is concluded that crop diversification by intercropping has the potential to reduce global requirements for synthetic fertilizer N and consequently support the development of more sustainable cropping systems.

Recently, intercropping of grapevine and oat was shown to reduce Cu toxicity effects, modulating the root ionome. On these bases, the focus of the work was to investigate the impact of Cu toxicity of either monocropped or oat-intercropped grapevine rootstocks plants (196.17 and Fercal), at both phenotypic (i.e., root architecture), and molecular (i.e., expression of transporters) levels. The results showed a different response in terms of root morphology that are both rootstock-and cropping system dependent. Moreover, the expression pattern of transporter genes (i.e., VvCTr, VvNRAMP, and VvIRT1) in monocropped grapevine might resemble a Mn deficiency response induced by the excess of Cu, especially in Fercal plants. The gene expression in intercropped grapevines suggested rootstock-specific response mechanisms, depending on Cu levels. In fact, at low Cu concentrations, Fercal enhanced both root system growth and transporter genes expression; contrarily, 196.17 increased apoplast divalent cations accumulation and transporters expression. At high Cu concentrations, Fercal increased the expression of all bivalent cation transporters and, as previously observed, enhanced the release of root exudates, whereas the 196.17 only modulated transporters. In conclusion, our results might suggest that the different adaptation strategies of the two rootstocks to Cu toxicity could be mainly ascribable to a fine-tuning of bivalent cations transporters expression at root level."

These studies have required the use of more precise analytical tools in order to better understand patterns in quantitative data. Mathematical models are among the most important tools to explain the dynamics of insect populations. This study investigated the population dynamics of aphids Aphis gossypii and Aphis craccivora over time, using mathematical models composed of a set of differential equations as a helpful analytical tool to understand the population dynamics of aphids in arrangements of cotton and cowpea. The treatments were sole cotton, sole cowpea, and three arrangements of cotton intercropped with cowpea (t(1), t(2) and t(3)). The plants were infested with two aphid species and were evaluated at 7, 14, 28, 35, 42, and 49 days after the infestations. Mathematical models were used to fit the population dynamics of two aphid species. There were good fits for aphid dynamics by mathematical model over time. The highest population peak of both species A. gossypii and A. craccivora was found in the sole crops, and the lowest population peak was found in crop system t(2). These results are important for integrated management programs of aphids in cotton and cowpea.	"[Fernandes, Francisco S.; Ramalho, Francisco S.; Santos, Barbara D.

Soybean seeds were sown in plastic pots and were allowed to germinate and grow for 30 days under shade or full sunlight conditions. Shade treated plants showed significantly increase on stem length and petiole length, and decrease on stem diameters, shoot biomass and its partition to leaf also were significantly lower than that in full sunlight. Smaller and thinner on shade treated leaves than corresponding leaves on full sunlight plants. The decreased leaf size caused by shade was largely attributable to cell proliferation in young leaves and both cell proliferation and enlargement in old leaves. Shade induced the expression of a set of genes related to cell proliferation and/or enlargement, but depended on the developmental stage of leaf. Shade significantly increased the auxin and gibberellin content, and significantly decreased the cytokinin content in young, middle and old leaves. Taken together, these results indicated that shade inhibited leaf size by controlling cell proliferation and enlargement, auxin, gibberellin and cytokinin may play important roles in this process.

Control of potato virus Y (PVY) in seed potatoes by oil spraying, straw mulching and intercropping	PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						"aphids; IPM; Potyvirus; vector"	"ALATE APHIDS HOMOPTERA; GREEN PEACH APHID; MINERAL-OIL; MYZUS-PERSICAE; MOSAIC-VIRUS; TRANSMISSION; SPREAD; INSECTICIDES; BEHAVIOR; PLANTS"	Potato virus Y (PVY) is the potato virus with the highest economic impact on seed potato production. Insecticides are efficient in controlling aphids, which are the vectors of this virus, but rarely limit virus spread in the field. Straw mulching and mineral oil spraying are known as alternatives to insecticides to reduce PVY incidence, but important year-to-year variation in efficacy has been observed with both of these techniques. Preliminary studies revealed the efficacy of intercropping in controlling PVY spread, but more data are needed to validate this observation. A four-year field trial was conducted in Switzerland to assess the potential synergistic effect of combining mineral oil spraying with straw mulching to increase the protection of seed potato crops against PVY spread. Furthermore, the efficacy of intercropping with oat and hairy vetch was examined as a novel way to control in-field PVY spread. The present work demonstrates that the modes of action of mineral oil and straw mulching are complementary and reduce the year-to-year variation observed with oil and straw when used alone as PVY control agents. The results also demonstrate the efficacy of intercropping for the control of PVY, and the mode of action of this novel control method is discussed. Overall, this work shows that it is possible to increase the protection of potato fields against PVY spread by combining control strategies with different modes of action that complement each other, such as mulching, oil spraying and intercropping.

A field experiment and a static incubation study in a lab were conducted to stimulate wheat growth and investigate its potential to reduce CO2 emissions from soil through intercropping with a traditional Chinese medicinal herb called Isatis indigotica. This work was conducted by adding L indigotica root exudates based on the quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis of the DNA copy number of the rhizosphere or bulk soil microbial populations. This addition was performed in relation to the CO2 formation by cellulolytic microorganisms (Penicillium oxalicum, fungi and Ruminococcus albus) to elucidate the microbial ecological basis for the molecular mechanism that decreases CO2 emissions from wheat fields using I. indigotica. The results showed that the panicle weight and full grains per panicle measured through intercropping with I. indigotica (NPKWR) increased by 39% and 28.6%, respectively, compared to that of the CK (NPMW). Intercropping with I. indigotica significantly decreased the CO2 emissions from soil under wheat cultivation. Compared with CK, the total CO2 emission flux during the wheat growth period in the L indigotica (NPKWR) intercropping treatment decreased by 29.26%. The intensity of CO2 emissions per kg of harvested wheat grain declined from 7.53 kg CO2/kg grain in the NPKW (CM) treatment to 5.55 kg CO2/kg grain in the NPKWR treatment. The qPCR analysis showed that the DNA copy number of the microbial populations of cellulolytic microorganisms (P. oxalicum, fungi and R. albus) in the field rhizosphere around I. indigotica or in the bulk soil under laboratory incubation was significantly lower than that of CM. This finding indicated that root exudates from I. indigotica inhibited the activity and number of cellulolytic microbial populations, which led to decreased CO2 emissions, suggesting this plant's potential role in mitigating agricultural GHGs and in supporting agroecology.

Lamb production responses to grass grazing in a companion crop system with corn silage and oversowing of yellow oat in a tropical region	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						"Animal carcass; Avena byzantina; Integrated crop-livestock system; Live weight gain; Urochloa brizantha; Total operating cost"	"LIVESTOCK INTEGRATION; GRAIN-YIELD; NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; SHEEP PRODUCTION; FORAGE; PASTURE; SOIL; PERFORMANCE; INTERCROP"	Integrated crop-livestock systems in regions with dry winters could be a viable option to increase food production during periods of irregular rain and reduced pasture availability. A corn (Zea mays L.) silage production system with cover crops of (a) the weedy growth of signal grass [Urochloa decumbens (Stapf) R. Webster Basilisk] and (b) palisade grass [Urochloa brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich.) R. Webster 'Marandu' and 'Natal both with a 020- and 0.45-m silage cutting height, was employed in the summer and autumn. Yellow oat (Avena byzantina cv. Sao Carlos) was oversown in these systems in the winter and spring. The pasture production, the daily ration intake, the performance and carcass characteristics of lambs (Ovis aries) grazing these pastures in a semi-feedlot system (supplemented with silage and concentrate), and the revenue were investigated. The experiment was repeated in the same location for two growing seasons (2010-2011 and 2011-2012) on a Typic Haplorthox in Botucatu, Sao Paulo, Brazil. Analyzing the system as a whole, intercropping corn silage with palisade grass cv. Marandu (followed by palisade grass cv. Plata) with a cutting height of 0.45 m combined with yellow oat oversowing was the most robust option for enhancing productivity. The pasture formation for lamb finishing in a semi-feedlot system, the reduction of silage and concentrate intake, and greater live weight and carcass gains per hectare were key attributes for improving the economic viability of this integrated crop -livestock system. Thus, these crop systems were a viable option for the diversification of agricultural activities in tropical regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Growing spring cereals with undersown legumes has a positive effect on soil fertility, enriching it with nitrogen, through symbiosis of legumes with nodule bacteria. Two hypotheses were tested: 1) undersowing of red clover increases the protein content of barley grains and 2) mineral N has negative aftereffect on growth of legume plants. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of organic (cattle manure, off-season cover crop) and mineral N in organic and conventional farming systems on (i) barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) grain yield and quality, (ii) biomass yield formation of undersown red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and (iii) the aftereffect of mineral and organic N fertilisers on the red clover crop biomass yield in the following year. The experiment was established in 2008 at the Estonian University of Life Sciences (58 degrees 22'N, 26 degrees 40'E) on the soil described as Stagnic Albic Luvisol (LV ab-st) (WRB, 2014) with sandy loam surface texture, 1.38% C, 0.13% N, 133 mg kg(-1) P, 210 mg kg(-1) K and pH(KCl) 6.0. The crops were treated using different farming systems: three organic (Org0, OrgI and OrgII) and four conventional (N0, N40, N80 and N120); nitrogen sources during crop cycle period: N0 and Org0 = symbiotically fixed atmospheric N-2, N40 = N-2 + mineral N 40 kg ha(-1) N, N80 = N-2 + mineral N 80 kg ha(-1) N, N120 = N-2 + mineral N 120 kg ha(-1) N, OrgI = N-2 + N taken up by cover crops (N-CC) and OrgII = N-2 + N-CC + N applied with manure (N-m). Our study revealed that grain yield of barley was strongly affected by undersown red clover; because of competition for nutrients in cereal-legume mixture the grain yield of barley in organic system was 11. 61% lower than that in conventional system. The seed rate of undersown red clover (2.84 million viable seed per ha) was too high. The content of protein depended on the availability of mineralised nitrogen. The mean protein content of barley grains over the trial years and treatments was 99 +/- 1.6 g kg(-1) in the conventional system, which was 17% higher than that in the organic system. Undersowing of red clover had no significantly positive effect on the grain yield and protein content of barley. Mineral N fertiliser had no negative aftereffect on growth of the red clover crop the following year. Mean above ground biomass yield over the trial years for the red clover crop 2nd cut was 17% higher in the conventional system than in the organic system."

Limited rainfall, poor soil fertility, and insufficient agronomic inputs all contribute to low pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.] yields. This study was initiated to assess the potential for increasing millet yields through intercropping (living cover) and mulching (desiccated cover) practices. During the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons, pearl millet was intercropped with cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.], mungbean [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek], or grown under mulch (neem [Azadirachta indica] leaves applied at 2 t ha(-1)). Field trials were conducted at two sites within Senegal's central millet-peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) basin, in Bambey (14 degrees 41'38 '' N, 16 degrees 28'12 '' W) and Thies (14 degrees 45'45 '' N, 16 degrees 53'14 '' W). Soil moisture and plant N (based on the normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI]) were measured in addition to yield. When intercropped with a legume, millet grain yields increased up to 55% compared to millet alone. The combined grain yields under intercropping (millet + legume) were always higher than yields of millet alone, up to 67% in Bambey. Mulching increased soil moisture up to 14%, with yield increases of up to 70% over millet with no mulch. Plant N increased in both intercropped and mulched millet, with NDVI increases up to 21% with mulch and 16% when grown with a legume (prior to flowering). These yield increases were achieved using resources that are available and affordable to small-scale producers in the region (seeds and mulch), and did not require the addition of fertilizer inputs.

Results revealed that dry matter yields increased with delayed cutting from stem elongation to early heading stage. Higher oat proportions in sowing mixture resulted in higher first cut dry matter yields but negatively affected the Egyptian clover first cut and re-growth DM yield. Lower first cut DM yield at lower oat proportions were compensated by vigorous Egyptian clover re-growth. It may be suggested that for obtaining higher DM yield from oat: Egyptian clover mixture under two-cut system best combination of seeding rate and harvesting stage is 25:100% and early heading stage.

The forrage mass avarage production was 2,378.96, 3,289.49, and 2,749.86 kg/ha for the control pastures, with clover and nitrogen, respectively, from July 12(th) to October 8(th) 2006, totalizing 89 days of grazing with an average forrage supply of 14.90 kg DM/100 kg body weight and daily weight gain of 1.280 kg /animal/day. At the end of the experiment, pasture beared a transportation capacity of 1,528.25; 1,244.32 and 1,156.17 kg of body weight for nitrogen fertilization, with clover and control, respectively. The highest animal/ha production was obtained with nitrogen fertilization (541.49 kg/ha). The inclusion of white clover intercropped with oats in system of crop-livestock integration is not enough to maintain the sustainability of intensive systems high productivity."

A bioactive organic fertilizer using rice bran, oil mill sludge and fish meal as materials and a microbial inoculant (EM as its commercial name) as fermentation starter, was applied into the 3-cm surface soil layer, where the bio-fertilizer was aerobically re-fermented and seeds of weeds were damaged during germination by the fermenting process. Weed population decreased more than 50% by applying the bioactive organic fertilizer on soil surface. In the second experiment, residues of winter wheat were brailed on soil surface in pigtail style as mulch after the ears were harvested. This kind of residue mulching depressed weeds significantly, increased soil microbial quantity and activity, avoided powdery mildew and increased pumpkin fruit yield. In the third experiment, as a cover crop, peanut intercropped into tomato crop smothered weeds, decreased tomato leaf blight infection and increased tomato fruit yield more than 10% in addition to the peanut harvest. It is concluded that above mentioned three methods can be adopted in integrated weed management in organic or nature farming systems.

The objective of this research was to evaluate field pea breeding lines for agronomic performance and seed quality focussed to their use in a sustainable production. Thirty-five field pea breeding lines and six elite cultivars were evaluated for their agronomic value in field in Spain upon 20 traits related to flower, cycle, plant architecture, productivity and seed quality. The lines showed significant differences in all the quantitative traits evaluated and three of them, namely MB-0307, MB-0308, and MB-0319 were chosen to be evaluated, together with the advanced cultivar ZP-1233, in field and in growing chamber for agronomic performance, seed quality and ability for sustainable production. The four accessions displayed high seed protein content that had significant effect of cropping density with averages of 253.6 g kg(-1) under low cropping density of 60 plants m(-2) and 259.1 g kg(-1) under high cropping density of 90 plants m(-2), therefore, the low cropping density should be regarded as the most convenient. Average yield of the lines MB-0307, MB-0308 and MB-0319 and the cultivar ZP-1233 was fair (197.5 g m(-2)), probably due to the absence of fertilizers and irrigation, aiming for the sustainability of the crop. Intercropping with rye and herbicide application resulted in no differences on the seed yield; therefore, the ability of the breeding lines to grow without herbicide seems to be demonstrated, while the germination of the seeds at low temperature was very good. These results indicate that field pea could be a new protein crop in the North of Spain to satisfy the demand of plant protein for animal feed, based upon adapted breeding lines that combine the ability for growing under sustainable conditions with other desirable agronomic traits maintaining an adequate productivity."

Short-range spatial variability of soil delta N-15 natural abundance - effects on symbiotic N-2-fixation estimates in pea	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						"short-range; natural abundance; N(2)fixation; delta N-15 variability; Pisum sativum"	"SOUTH-WEST AUSTRALIA; DINITROGEN FIXATION; NITROGEN-FIXATION; PASTURE LEGUMES; LANDSCAPE-SCALE; N-2 FIXATION; N-15; CROP; INTERCROPS; SELECTION"	The delta N-15 natural abundance (%) of the total soil N pool varies at the landscape level, but knowledge on short-range variability and consequences for the reliability of isotopic methods are poorly understood. The short-range spatial variability of soil delta N-15 natural abundance as revealed by the N-15 abundance in spring barley and N-2-fixing pea was measured within the 0.15-4 m scale at flowering and at maturity. The short-range spatial variability of soil delta N-15 natural abundance and symbiotic nitrogen fixation were high at both growth stages. Along a 4-m row, the delta N-15 natural abundance in barley reference plants varied up to 3.9 degrees C, and sometimes this variability was observed even between plants grown only 30 cm apart. The delta N-15 natural abundance in pea varied up to 1.4 parts per thousand within the 4-m row. The estimated percentage of nitrogen derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa) varied from 73-89% at flowering and from 57-95% at maturity. When increasing the sampling area from 0.01 m(2) (single plants) and up to 0.6 m(2) (14 plants) the %Ndfa coefficient of variation (CV) declined from 5 to 2% at flowering and from 12 to 2% at maturity. The implications of the short-range variability in delta N-15 natural-abundance are that estimates of symbiotic N-2-fixation can be obtained from the natural abundance method if at least half a square meter of crop and reference plants is sampled for the isotopic analysis. In fields with small amounts of representative reference crops (weeds) it might be necessary to sow in reference crop species to secure satisfying N-2-fixation estimates.

A 6-yr (1993 to 1998) field study was conducted at the Iowa State University's Northeastern Research Center near Nashua, Iowa, to evaluate the effects of non-traditional cropping systems (strip inter cropping (STR)-corn (Zea mays L.)/soybean (Glycine max L.)/oats (Avina saliva L.)); alfalfa rotation (ROT)-3-yr (1993 to 1995) alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) followed by corn in 1996, soybean in 1997, and oats in 1998), and traditional cropping system (corn after soybean (CS) and soybean after corn (SC) on the flow weighted average nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations and NO3-N leaching losses with subsurface drainage water. The soils at the research site are loamy with 3% to 4% organic matter and are underlain by subsurface drainage system. The data collected from four experimental treatments were analyzed as an unbalanced incomplete block design using F-test and T-test among treatments and within treatments, respectively. When averaged across 6-yr, non-traditional cropping systems reduced flow weighted average NO3-N concentrations in subsurface drain water with highly significantly effect (P < 0.01) in comparison with traditional cropping system (6.5 vs. 11.2 mg L-(1)). Similarly, the strip inter cropping system increased corn grain yields by 5% (9.03 vs. 8.6 Mg ha-(1)) and reduced NO3-N leaching losses by 6% (12.6 vs. 13.5 kg-N ha-(1)) and showed no difference in soybean yields when compared with traditional cropping system.

Merr.] has been found to yield a greater harvest of total grain protein than a sole crop of corn in northern temperate regions. Similarly, it may be possible to increase the total grain protein yield in regions of lower precipitation with an intercrop of grain sorghum [bicolor (L.) Moench] and a pulse crop. Our objective was to determine if sorghum could successfully be intercropped with dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) to produce a grain for feed. A field experiment was conducted during 1989 and 1990 near Carrington, ND (45-degrees 30'N, 99-degrees 7'W. Sorghum was established at 16 plants m-2 as a sole crop and intercropped in the same row with pinto bean at three different sorghum to bean plant ratios: 8:1, 4:1, and 2:1. Grain yield of sorghum was not reduced by intercropping at the low (8:1) and moderate (4.1) bean plant densities, but yield was reduced (P < 0.05) at a sorghum:pinto bean plant ratio of 2:1. Yield of pinto bean ranged from 0.22 to 0.70 Mg ha-1, depending on population and annual growing conditions. Grain protein yield tended to increase as bean comprised more of the total plant population, although a significant difference between treatments was not detected. While this investigation demonstrates that sorghum can successfully be intercropped with dry bean, other sorghum-pulse intercrops might be more advantageous in increasing the total yield of grain protein.

Nonetheless, a number of fundamental questions remain. A series of experiments was initiated in the field to examine N transfer between N-2-fixing soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) varieties and a non-nodulating soybean, and between N-2-fixing peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) or soybean and neighboring weed species. The experiments were conducted in soils with low N fertilities and used differences in N accumulation and/or N-15 natural abundance to estimate N transfer. Mixtures of N-2-fixing and non-nod soybean indicated that substantial inter-plant N transfer occurred. Amounts were variable, ranging from negligible levels to 48% of the N found in the non-nod at maturity. Transfer did not appear to strongly penalize the N-2-fixing donor plants. But, in cases where high amounts of N were transferred, N content of donors was noticeably lowered. Differences were evident in the amount of N transferred from different N-2-fixing donor genotypes. Results of experiments with N-2-fixing crops and the weed species prickly sida (Sida spinosa L.) and sicklepod (Senna obtusifolia [L.] Irwin & Barneby) also indicated substantial N transfer occurred over a 60-day period, with amounts accounting for 30-80% of the N present in the weeds. Transfer of N, however, was generally very low in weed species that are known to be non-hosts for arbuscular mycorrhizae (yellow nutsedge, Cyperus esculentus L. and Palmer amaranth, Amaranthus palmeri [S.] Watson). The results are consistent with the view that N transfer occurs primarily through mycorrhizal hyphal networks, and they reveal that N transfer may be a contributing factor to weed problems in N-2-fixing crops in low N fertility conditions.

J	Tokatlidis, IS				Tokatlidis, Ioannis S.			Crop adaptation to density to optimise grain yield: breeding implications	EUPHYTICA			English	Article						"Climate change; Competition; Intercropping; Plant yield efficiency; Plasticity; Resource use efficiency; Yield gap"	"TO-PLANT VARIABILITY; MAIZE HYBRIDS; GENOTYPE PERFORMANCE; POPULATION DENSITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SIZE STRUCTURE; DRYLAND CORN; SELECTION; COMPETITION; WHEAT"	Competition between crop plants, due to resource limitation, is at the root of a considerable yield limitation, a major problem that future agriculture is faced with. Due to inter-plant variation, intra-crop competition causes plant-to-plant interference and unbalanced use of input which decreases possible profit. Acquired intra-crop competition is a priori present in farming due to spatial heterogeneity. Genetically imposed intra-crop competition is due to the plant-to-plant genetic differences, i.e. the intra-species genetic competition in multi-genotypic varieties grown alone, and both the intra-and inter-species genetic competition in intercropping multi-genotypic varieties. In general, high densities accelerate the acquired plant-to-plant variation and intensify the intra-crop competition. Considering environmental diversity, an additional yield gap element is density-reliance. Density-reliant varieties are inefficient in resource use at the single-plant level and present poor results at low densities, accompanied by variation in optimum density particularly in rain-fed agroecosystems. The remedy relies on breeding of varieties that comprise the 'weak competitor' ideotype(s) of improved plant yield efficiency in order to mitigate the intra-crop variation and optimise the resource use across variable conditions. To focus on both, selection at nil-competition (widely spaced plants to preclude interference for inputs) is necessary. Selection among spaced plants is further supported by the negative relationship between genotype competitive and yielding ability. The derived density-independent varieties would be capable of taking advantage of the abundance of resources in favourable seasons at low densities that are suitable for dry seasons, approaching the attainable yield across locations and seasons.

To clarify whether competition or facilitation occurs between grasses and legumes, biomass production and nitrogen (N) acquisition of legumes and grasses were investigated in different cropping regimes. Two grasses (Zea mays and Sorghum bicolor) and three legumes (Glycine max, Medicago sativa and Vigna radiata) were monocropped or intercropped under field conditions. A short-term 15N labelling experiment was carried out to quantify the biomass production and N uptake by grasses and legumes growing in different cropping regimes for 104 days. Productions of three legumes significantly decreased as intercropped with both grasses (at least a 20 % decrease for all legumes), while that of both grasses kept relatively stable. All the plants consistently showed a preference for NO3xe213; relative to NH4+ and were not influenced by the cropping regimes. NO3xe213; uptake rate by G. max when intercropped with Z. mays or S. bicolor at 0-5 cm soil depth was only 58.8 % of monocropped ones. NO3xe213; uptake rate by M. sativa and V. radiata when intercropped with S. bicolor were significantly higher (at least 3.5 times) than that in monocropped ones at 0-5 cm soil depth. Furthermore, NO3xe213; uptake rate by M. sativa when intercropped with S. bicolor was 3.5 times higher than that in monocropped at 5-15 cm soil depth. In addition, intercropping did not change the NH4+ uptake rate by any plants in any cropping regimes. Intercropping decreased the production of all three legumes, but did not change the production of the two grasses. Intercropping strongly affected NO3xe213; uptake by legumes and not by grasses. Moreover, positive linear regressions between NUE or production and total N uptake for monocropped rather than intercropped plants indicate that higher N uptake rates facilitate the production and NUE for plants. Intercropping M. sativa with S. bicolor could be worth trying in agricultural practice for the high N uptake rate by M. sativa in the intercropping system."

Pathotypes of Colletotrichum sublineolum in Response to Sorghum Populations with Different Levels of Genetic Diversity in Sete Lagoas-MG	JOURNAL OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY			English	Article						"anthracnose; dynamic multilines; genetic variability; host differential; Sorghum bicolor"	"F SP TRITICI; ERYSIPHE-GRAMINIS; ANTHRACNOSE RESISTANCE; PUCCINIA-GRAMINIS; MIXED STANDS; SP HORDEI; MIXTURES; SELECTION; BARLEY; RACES"	Sorghum anthracnose is one of the most important and destructive diseases of sorghum. Genetic resistance has been the most efficient strategy to control the disease, but the high variability of the pathogen population in Brazil has resulted in only modest efficacy. Accordingly, we investigated the variability of Colletotrichum sublineolum in response to sorghum populations with three levels of genetic diversity: pure stand, three-way hybrids and physical mixtures of three-way hybrids. Six plots of each treatment were planted in different areas and at different dates. A total of 480 isolates, that is 40 single-conidium isolates per plot, were collected from the field experiment to characterize the variability of the pathogen in each host population. Isolates were inoculated in a greenhouse on a differential line set composed of eight sorghum inbred lines. Our results reveal that the pathogen populations derived from three-way combinations had higher pathotype diversity than did those derived from pure stand host populations. More complexly, virulent phenotypes were also developed in genetically diverse stands compared to pure stand host populations. The diversification of the host population limits pathogen adaptation, thus resulting in a significantly higher number of pathotypes. The results of this study will improve the management of sorghum anthracnose in the field by helping sorghum breeders maintain disease resistance.

Intercropping could improve soil quality, the stability of yields and climate resilience. Whether direct emissions of greenhouse gases from soil are reduced as well, depends on the specific measures of diversification. Here, we determined the greenhouse gas emissions from soils of two diversification experiments in the Pannonian climate of Hungary. Firstly, in an asparagus field, oat and field pea was introduced as intercrop between the asparagus berms. Secondly, grass and aromatic herbs were intercropped in a vineyard between the grape rows. The results show that especially for nitrous oxide, average treatment emissions can increase with additional legumes (+252% with intercropped field peas) but decrease with aromatic herbs (-66%). No significant changes were found for methane exchange. This shows that, while other ecosystem services can be increased by intercropping, changes in soil greenhouse gas emissions by intercropping are highly context dependent.

An assessment of the suitability of catch crops in relation to their yield and soil coverage was made. The field experiment was set up in a corn-growing area (south Moravia, Czech Republic). The results show a statistically significant difference in yield of dry matter and soil coverage among catch crops as well as among years. The most appropriate was the cultivation of Phacelia tanacetifolia Bentham and Sinapis alba L., which regularly provided the highest yields and soil coverage. In some years, similar results were also achieved for Fagopyrum esculentum Moench and Carthamus tinctorius L. Less suitable catch crops are Secale cereale var. multicaule L., which ensured lower yield and good soil coverage, but reduced the yield of spring barley, and Panicum miliaceum L. Yield of spring barley was affected by year and species of catch crops. The lowest yield of barely was in the year with unfavourable rainfall. The yield decreased with increasing quantities of catch crop matter. In the case of favourable rainfall year, there was no risk of lower yield of spring barley after monitored catch crops in one of the driest and warmest places in the Czech Republic.

A 10-year field trial on sloping citrus lands was conducted to evaluate five protection methods for reducing N and P losses: 1) intercropping with perennial white clover (CW); 2) straw mulching of the soil surface (CS); 3) intercropping with yellow daylily contour hedgerows (CH); 4) an impermeable membrane buried in the soil along the contour lines (CM); and 5) intercropping with a rotation of wheat and peanut (CWP). An area of conventional citrus management was also maintained as the control (CK). The results showed that CM and CH were the most effective methods for reducing surface runoff. The sediment yield were reduced at the highest rate by CW and CH and was also significantly reduced by CS. Reduced runoff volume and sediment yield were the crucial mechanism for the reductions in N and P losses. Compared with the control, CW, CS, CH, and CM reduced annual runoff by 9%, 13%, 25%, and 30%, sediment yield by 77%, 55%, 71%, and 28%, N loss by 10%, 23% 36%, and 37%, and P loss by 39%, 31%, 27%, and 25%, respectively. CW, CS, CH, and CM were effective in reducing N and P losses from the sloping citrus land. However, over the long-term, surface soil nutrient accumulation in CW, CS, and CH diminished the benefit of those methods in reducing N and P losses. In addition, CWP increased soil erosion and nutrient loss, which showed that citrus intercropping with other crops was an unsuitable method for citrus sloping land in the Three Gorges area."

POPULATION DENSITY AND WEED INFESTATION IN ORGANIC NO-TILLAGE CORN CROPPING SYSTEM UNDER DIFFERENT SOIL COVERS	PLANTA DANINHA			English	Article						"Avena strigosa; Lupinus albus; straw; organic farming"	"RESIDUES; DYNAMICS"	Currently, one of the biggest challenges faced by organic no-tillage farming is weed control. Thus, the use of cropping practices that help in the control of weeds is extremely important. The objective of this study was to evaluate population density and level of weed infestation in an organic no-tillage corn cropping system under different soil covers. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with six repetitions and five treatments, consisting of three soil covers in an organic no-tillage system, and an organic and a conventional system, both without soil cover. The treatments with soil cover used a grass species represented by the black oat, a leguminous species represented by the white lupine, and intercropping between both species. Corn was sown with spacing of 1.0 m between rows and 0.20 m between plants, using the commercial hybrid AG 1051. Infestation in corn was evaluated at stages V5 and V10, and weed density was evaluated at stage V5. The use of black oat straw alone or intercropped with white lupine, in the organic no-tillage corn cropping system, reduced the percentage of weed infestation and absolute weed density.

The experiment was carried out from 2009 to 2010, with three species of the family Leguminosae and three of the family Poaceae, in the experimental area of the campus of the Universidade Federal de Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The evaluated species were: caracas rattlebox (Crotalaria anagyroides), jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), black oat (Avena strigosa), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), sown with and without intercropping. Jack bean and sorghum showed the highest rate of soil covering in single cropping, whereas pearl millet the lowest. Sorghum in single cropping and intercropped with jack bean and pigeon pea shows the largest production of green matter and dry matter, whereas pigeon pea presents the lowest production of green matter, and caracas rattlebox the lowest production of dry matter. At the implantation of the commercial culture, the largest amount of straw above the soil was provided by the intercropping between jack bean and sorghum.

Integrated pearl millet management in the sahel: Effects of legume rotation and fallow management on productivity and Striga hermonthica infestation	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						"cowpea; intercropping; rotation; Sahel; Sub-Saharan Africa"	"SEMIARID TROPICS; CONTINUOUS CULTIVATION; CROPPING SYSTEMS; NUTRIENT FLOWS; SOIL FERTILITY; COWPEA; NITROGEN; YIELDS; TILLAGE; SORGHUM"	Increasing population density and food needs in the Sahel are major drivers behind the conversion of land under natural vegetation to arable land. Intensification of agriculture is a necessity for farmers to produce enough food. As manure is scarce and fertilizers expensive, this study looks into the potential role of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) and short duration fallow in maintaining soil fertility and productivity and in reducing the major weed problem Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth. The research was carried out 'on-farm' in a traditional millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R.Br.) growing area in the Malian Sahel, near Bankass. The four year experiment combined 0, 2, 5, and 7 years of preceding fallow with (i) 4 years of millet, (ii) 1 year of cowpea + 3 years of millet, and (iii) 1 year of cowpea + 3 years of millet/cowpea inter-cropping. Total millet production (4 years) was 1440 kg ha(-1) for all systems with 2, 5 or 7 years of preceding fallow against 1180 kg ha(-1) for systems without fallow. Cowpea grain production showed no significant differences between fallow treatments. Over 4 years, all cropping systems produced similar total amounts of millet grain, implying that the millet 'lost' during the year with a pure cowpea crop in treatments (ii) and (iii) was compensated within three years, while the cowpea grain production was an additional benefit. Such compensation was however not observed for increasing number of preceding fallow years, showing that there is no additional production benefit in 5-7 years of fallow as compared to 2 years. The soil organic carbon content decreased more slowly in treatments with a cowpea pure crop in 1998 than in the millet pure crop, while overall higher contents were observed after preceding fallow also after four years of cropping. Striga hermonthica infestation decreased linearly with duration of preceding fallow, but also after seven years of fallow and one year of cowpea the hemi-parasitic weed still re-appeared. Overall the intensification through a cowpea pure crop and cowpea intercrop in these millet-based systems improved production and a number of other characteristics of the system, making it more viable.

Binary mixtures of a spring cereal, barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) or oat (Avena sativa L.), and a fall crop, fall rye (Secale cereale L.) or Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.), were seeded at three total stand seed densities (150, 275 and 400 seeds m(-2)), which consequently resulted in the following spring:fall seeding crop component ratios: 1:0, 2:1, 1:2 and 0:1. Both spring and fall crops were harvested when the spring cereals were at the soft-dough stage (silage cut) and late in the autumn (fall regrowth cut). Average spring crop component yield was greater for the silage cut (4806 kg ha(-1)) than for the fall regrowth cut (329 kg ha(-1)), and total sward yield was greater for the silage cut (5995 kg ha(-1)) than for the fall regrowth cut (1261 kg ha(-1)). Productivity of the fall component was 1173 and 929 kg ha(-1) for the silage and fall regrowth cuts, respectively. Total crop yield was often maximized with seeding ratios of 60% spring:fall crop component or greater for the different combinations. Fall regrowth cut yields were always maximized by seeding 100% fall crop component. The spring crop component yield; especially for the oat mixtures, contributed very little to fall regrowth yields. Stand seeding rate frequently affected spring component and total crop yield, but not fall crop yield. Silage and annual yield for the spring crop and total sward increased with increase in stand seeding rate. Fall crop yield was not affected by stand seeding rate or its effect was of questionable practical importance. Italian ryegrass produced the most fall regrowth yield. Weed management was identified as a possible area for future research with regard to seeding ratios and rates for annual forage stands."

In the greenhouse, emergence and early growth of two medic (Medicago) species was greatest when planted 1.5 cm deep. In the field, Berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.), four medic species, and yellow mustard (Brassica hirta Moench) were planted immediately after corn or soybean planting in a 25-cm-wide band centered over the crop row. All species achieved 45% or more ground cover by 72 days after planting and yellow mustard often generated ground cover more quickly than other species. Weed suppression varied, with yellow mustard and Sava medic (Medicago scutellata L.) often providing greater weed suppression than other species. However, weed suppression was highly variable and crop yields were usually reduced compared with weed-free plots. Killing Sava medic 30 days after planting reduced weed suppression and did not increase corn yield compared with allowing the medic to survive until maturity. Delaying seeding of Sava medic until rotary hoeing increased weed suppression compared with rotary hoeing alone.

Native pastures and crop residues are the major feed sources, but their quality is often poor. Integration of forage legumes in the cropping system is one alternative to improve the fodder quality. Results of field work conducted over two seasons in order to assess and evaluate the potential yields of crops, crop/forage combinations and rotation systems on a Vertisol under two seed bed preparation systems showed that intercropping wheat with clover or sequential cropping of an oat/vetch mixture followed by chickpea provided high-quality fodder; the effect was greater under fertilized conditions. In addition, where monocropping treatment was tested, legume-cereal rotation resulted in higher grain and fodder yield when compared to cereal-cereal rotation. The study also showed that two short-duration crops could be produced in sequence per year. It is therefore suggested that the Vertisols in the Ethiopian highlands could provide a good opportunity for longer period cropping using improved food and forage crops, thereby improving the availability and quality of animal feed and protecting the land against erosion."

We find that auctions reveal farmer preferences more accurately than stated nonbinding rankings in this context and that participatory on-farm crop research is essential to understanding how farmers evaluate tradeoffs between multiple crop attributes.

Bean proportions in intercropping ranged from 13 to 55%. In intercropping, the mean rust incidence and severity was reduced by 25 and 16%, respectively, compared with sole cropping. Similarly CBB incidence was reduced by 29% while severity was reduced by 20%. Single and multiple variable logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association of rust and CBB diseases with cropping systems and practices, geographical areas, cropping years and altitude. The analyses indicated that cropping system, geographical area and cropping year were important variables and affected both rust incidence and severity. In Habro during 1998 there was a high probability of rust incidence and severity greater than 25%. The probability of rust incidence and severity exceeding 25% in Habro was about 11 and 4 times greater than in Chercher and Wobera areas, respectively. Less than 50% bean proportions in intercropping were significantly associated with low (< 25%) rust severity, Similarly geographical area, altitude and cropping system affected CBB incidence and severity. In Habro and at lower altitudes there was a high probability of greater than 25% CBB incidence and severity. Bean plants at podding and or maturity were closely associated with high rust and CBB severity. Intercropping systems were more associated with lower CBB and rust intensity than sole cropping.

Predation pressure in Ugandan cotton fields measured by a sentinel prey method	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA			English	Article						"biological control; tropical agroecosystems; spillover predation; intercropping; Uganda; pesticides; natural enemies; artificial caterpillars; ecosystem service; Malvaceae"	"NATURAL ENEMIES; BENEFICIAL ARTHROPODS; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; TERMITE DAMAGE; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT; MAIZE; PESTS; CATERPILLARS; AGRICULTURE"	Pest suppression by natural enemies is an important ecosystem service, which is a valuable resource to poor smallholders in developing countries. Diverse natural enemy assemblages of arthropod predators and parasitoids are documented in various regions in Africa, but our knowledge of their impact on herbivores in agroecosystems remains limited. We conducted experiments in cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L. (Malvaceae), under typical local agronomic practices in Uganda to assess levels of predation pressure ascribed to natural enemies. We measured predation rates on artificial caterpillars made of plasticine glued to cotton plants. Predation pressure on cotton fields varied between 1.96 and 4.1% per day, but was not significantly influenced by cotton treatments (insecticide/no insecticide, monocropping/intercropping with Phaseolus spp.). Predation pressure in non-crop habitats adjacent to cotton fields was up to 12x higher than in the fields. Marks left on the artificial caterpillars revealed that arthropods and birds were largely accountable for predation in cotton fields, whereas arthropods and small mammals were dominant in non-cultivated habitats.

Sugarcane planting patterns (SPPs), including the area ratios of Rp and intercropping (Ic) on the hillslopes, may mitigate these negative impacts by increasing surface coverage. But the effectiveness of SPPs on these impacts has not been quantified at both hillslopes and watershed scale. We measured extreme rainfall erosion-induced nutrients losses on the upslopes with different area ratios of Rp and the deposition ratio on the downslopes with different Ic levels by using beryllium-7 (Be-7) technique. We estimated the export loads and coefficients of eroding sediment nutrients from the watersheds with different spatial configuration of Rp and Ic levels by combinative use of Be-7, compound-specific stable isotope (CSSI) and watershed monitoring. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loss increased with area ratios of Rp, ranging from 6.9 to 21.2 kg ha(-1) event(-1) and 2.8-9.6 kg ha(-1) event(-1), respectively. Delivery ratios of eroding nutrients from the upslopes decreased with intercropping levels on the downslopes, ranging between 38.0% and 49.6%. Export loads and coefficient of eroding nutrients varied with the spatial configuration of Rp ratios and Ic levels in the watershed, ranging from 0.04 kg ha(-1) to 1.76 kg ha(-1) and 1.09-25.15%, respectively. The magnitudes of sediment nutrient losses on the upslope were positively correlated with area ratios of Rp (P < 0.05), whereas their delivery ratios on the downslope were negatively correlated with Ic levels, although they were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The changes in ground litter cover (Glc) caused by Rp and Ic explained the variations of 53.6-55.3% in nutrient loss rate and of 74.1-74.4% in nutrient delivery ratio. Our results suggest that regulating SPPs could effectively mitigate erosion-induced nitrogen and phosphorus loss on the slopes and their export loads from the watershed.

However, variation is restricted in breeding for uniform crop populations using the pedigree line approach. Pedigree lines are successful in agriculture because synthetic inputs are used to raise fertility and control weeds, pests and diseases. An alternative method promoted for exploring the value of variation and evolutionary fitness in crops is to create composite cross populations. Composite cross populations are formed by assembling seed stocks with diverse evolutionary origins, recombination of these stocks by hybridization, the bulking of F, progeny, and subsequent natural selection for mass sorting of the progeny in successive natural cropping environments. Composite cross populations can provide dynamic gene pools, which in turn provide a means of conserving germplasm resources: they can also allow selection of heterogeneous crop varieties. The value of composite cross populations in achieving these aims is dependent on the outcome of mass trials by artificial and natural selection acting upon the heterogeneous mixture. There is evidence to suggest that composite cross populations may be an efficient way of providing heterogeneous crops and of selecting superior pure lines for low input systems characterized by unpredictable stress conditions.

Response of Ugandan common bean varieties to Pseudocercospora griseola and Angular leaf spot disease development in varietal mixtures	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEST MANAGEMENT			English	Article						"Angular leaf spot; evaluation; varietal mixtures; Africa; Uganda"	"WHEAT CULTIVAR MIXTURES; MULTILINE CULTIVARS; PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS; PHAEOISARIOPSIS-GRISEOLA; ANTHRACNOSE DEVELOPMENT; HOST DIVERSITY; MIXED STANDS; RESISTANCE; RUST; MANAGEMENT"	Angular leaf spot (ALS) is one of the most economically important bean diseases in Africa. One promising control option for the disease is the use of mixtures of resistant and susceptible varieties. This research evaluated (1) the reaction of farmer preferred bean varieties to ALS in the screenhouse and on-station and (2) the effect of different spatial arrangements of resistant and susceptible bean varieties on ALS disease development. For the latter, five mixture combinations and two controls were laid out in a Randomized Complete Block Design having three replicates. Analysis of variance and least significant differences (LSDs) were used to compare disease levels in both studies above. Varietal screening showed significant differences in varietal reaction to ALS. Screenhouse disease scores ranged between 0 and 5, compared to 0.7-3.9 in the field. For the varietal mixture trial, the lowest disease levels and the highest mixture efficiencies were observed for the combination of equal proportions of the susceptible and resistant varieties randomly mixed (even mixture) prior to planting. We conclude that even mixtures reduce the amount of ALS disease that develops in the season.

Corn Yield Response to the Solar Corridor in Upstate Missouri	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							"RELAY INTERCROPPING SOYBEANS; TWIN-ROW; SINGLE-ROW; LIGHT INTERCEPTION; PEANUT RESPONSE; ZONE TILLAGE; ZEA-MAYS; SOIL; WHEAT; MAIZE"	The solar corridor uses ultra wide-row (152-cm) corn (Zea mays L.) and reduced seeding rates to maximize photosynthesis of lower leaves and maintain or increase yield potential of the crop. But in common practice, seeding rates for corn have increased and row spacing decreased for early canopy development to maximize light interception, reduce weed interference, reduce herbicide applications and costs, and maintain conservation compliance. However, wide rows help manage disease in some instances. Relay-intercropping within the corn solar corridor may be an option. However, farmers must take into account crop management and harvest considerations for the system to be practical and economically viable. Research conducted in 2005, 2006, and 2011 evaluated corn hybrid response in 76- and 152-cm (solar corridor) row spacings. Although grain yields were similar for both row spacings in 2005, yields were 2.8 Mg ha(-1) (39%) greater in 76-cm rows than in 152-cm wide rows in 2006. In 2011, 76-cm single-row corn yielded 1.3 to 3.1 Mg ha(-1) (14-31%) more than 152-cm row spacing. In all 3 yr, grain moisture, protein, and starch concentration showed limited differences. Challenges encountered using the solar corridor must be addressed for the system to be consistent and successful.

Two experiments were established in split-plot designs with fall-winter as the main plot and spring as the subplots. In one experiment, sunflower and triticale were grown in Typic Rhodudalf (TR) soil in fall-winter; in the other experiment, monocropped and intercropped ruzigrass and grain sorghum were grown in Rhodic Hapludox (RH) soil in fall-winter. In both experiments, sunn hemp, forage sorghum, and pearl millet were grown in the spring; an additional fallow treatment was established in spring in TR. Soybean was grown every year in the summer in both experiments. After 12 (TR) and 9 (RH) years, the crop residue quality (e.g. N content and lignin-N ratio) and P inputs of the various crops were assessed. In addition, soil P fractions were determined according to the Hedley procedure. High-quality residue enhanced P recycling by soybean under crop rotation with sunn hemp in both experiments, sunflower in TR, and ruzigrass in RH. Sunn hemp increased soil labile P by 13% compared with pearl millet in TR and by 40% compared with forage sorghum and pearl millet in RH. Forage sorghum in spring enhanced P modlabile in TR, effect also observed for monocropped grain sorghum and ruzigrass in fall-winter in RH compared to both intercropped. In general, crop rotation under NT improved soil P lability, particularly the biological P pool, suggesting positive impacts from crop residue quality. The results of this study can be used to guide P fertilization strategies for NT cropping systems in tropical soils."

Soybean relay-cropped with winter camelina reduces biological nitrogen fixation	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							"COVER CROPS; INTERCROPPING SOYBEANS; BRASSICA-NAPUS; GROWTH; PENNYCRESS; AGRONOMICS; NODULATION; UREIDES; YIELD; WHEAT"	The contribution of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] to plant nutrition and its N credit for the next crop is significant. The amount of N fixed via BNF in monocropped soybean is well documented, but it is unknown when soybean is relayed into winter camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz]. Therefore, BNF in soybean relayed into fertilized (WCFerti) and unfertilized (WCUnfert) winter camelina grown for seed, and soybean seeded after winter camelina terminated as a cover crop (WCCC) were compared with a monocrop (control) soybean. The results showed that N-fixing bacteria successfully infected soybean roots and were potentially active in N fixation for all treatments. Ureide-N abundance was in the order of control > WCFerti = WCUnfert > WCCC. The control had 38 and 44% more ureide-N (indicating greater BNF) than WCFerti and WCUnfert, respectively. Relayed soybean had the same grain protein and oil concentrations as the control. However, the control had greater soybean grain, protein, and oil yields than relayed treatments due to grain yield differences. Fertilized winter camelina resulted in greater total (soybean + camelina) oil yield (859 kg ha(-1)) than the control (587 kg ha(-1)). The lower ureide-N abundance and grain yields for relayed soybean than the control was due to differences in belowground and aboveground biomass. Further research is needed to develop earlier-maturing winter camelina genotypes, better row spacing, and more shade-tolerant soybean cultivars to minimize competition between the two species, enhance BNF, and increase relayed-soybean yield.

Cropping system can change soil properties and fertility, which in turn determine plant growth and yield. The microbial community is the key regulator of plant health and production performance. Currently, there is limited understanding of the effects of cropping systems on microbial community composition, ecological processes controlling community assembly in different soil-plant continuum compartments of soybean. Here, we hope to clarify the structure and assembly process of different soybean compartments bacterial community at flowering stage through our work. The results showed that intercropping decreased the species diversity of rhizosphere and phyllosphere, and phylloaphere microbes mainly came from rhizosphere. FAPROTAX function prediction showed that indicator species sensitive to intercropping and crop rotation were involved in nitrogen/phosphorus cycle and degradation process, respectively. In addition, compared to the continuous cropping, intercropping increased the stochastic assembly processes of bacterial communities in plant-associated compartments, while crop rotation increased the complexity and stability of the rhizosphere network and the deterministic assembly process. Our study highlights the importance of intercropping and crop rotation, as well as rhizosphere and phyllosphere compartments for future crop management and sustainable agricultural regulation of crop microbial communities.

To examine the effects of shading on soybean plant lodging, the tall cultivar Heinong 48 (HN48) and dwarf cultivar Henong 60 (HN60), two soybean cultivars with large plant height differences (approximately 40 cm), were selected, and their internode lengths were measured under different planting densities in 2019 to determine the key internode influencing lodging. In 2020, we treated soybean plants with different shading treatments to examine the morphology, anatomical structure and stem fiber composition of the fifth internode, changes in the GA(3) (gibberellic acid) content, and relative expression of GA(3)-related enzyme genes in the stem under different shading conditions. The results showed that as the planting density increased, the lengths of the internodes changed significantly, starting from the fifth internode. Under different shading conditions, the length of the fifth internode increased for both cultivars, but the diameter and the diameter-to-length ratio decreased; the area of the xylem decreased, and the pith cells stretched more longitudinally and were more orderly; the lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose contents decreased; the GA(3) content in the stem increased, and the expression levels of GmGA3ox6, GmGA20ox1-D, and GmGA2ox4 enzyme genes were all upregulated; and the change in PSN treatment was more significant than other treatments. Therefore, the fifth internode was the key internode that affected lodging in soybean plants, shading could increase the GA(3) content significantly in soybean stems, and the increase in GA(3) content was positively correlated with the shaded area. This study provides a new direction for future research on lodging resistance in densely planted or intercropped soybean plants."

The tea plant is an economically important crop in China, but long-term monoculture and substantial chemical nitrogen fertilizer input cause soil acidification, which in turn affects the nutrient supply and tea quality. Intercropping has drawn more attention in tea gardens because this pattern is expected to improve soil fertility and tea quality and change the soil microbial community composition. However, the roles of some key microorganisms in rhizosphere soils have not been well characterized. Here, a soybean in summer and smooth vetch in winter strategy was used in a tea garden to investigate the effects of intercropped legumes on soil fertility, tea quality, and potential changes in beneficial bacteria such as Bacillus. Our data showed that when soybeans were turned into the soil, the intercropping system exhibited higher soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), tea quality indices, and expression of the Camellia sinensis glutamine synthetase gene (CsGS). Notably, intercropping significantly affected the bacterial communities, decreasing the relative abundance of Bacillus but increasing its absolute abundance. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens BM1 was isolated from intercropped soil and showed outstanding plant growth-promoting (PGP) properties when co-inoculated with rhizobia. In winter, intercropping with smooth vetch had a beneficial effect on soil properties and tea quality. Co-inoculation with strain BM1 and Rhizobium leguminosarum Vic5 on smooth vetch (Vicia villosa) produced huge improvements in SOM, TN, and tea leaf quality, which were accompanied by the highest level of amino acids and the lowest levels of polyphenols and caffeine (p < 0.05). Our findings demonstrate that intercropping with some legumes in the tea garden is a strategy that increases SOM, TN, and tea quality, and the optional use of some PGP Bacillus species produces an amplification effect.

Moench) may be harmlessly intercropped with Urochloa species during the off-season in the Brazilian Cerrado. At the end of the sorghum cycle, forages can be used for straw production for soybean (Glycine max L.) as the summer crop. This study aimed to evaluate sorghum cultivated during the off-season, intercropped with palisade grass (Urochloa brizantha cv. 'Marandu' (Hochst. ex A. Rich). R. D. Webster) and Congo grass (Urochloa ruziziensis (R. Germ. and Evrard) Crins) in two row spacings (0.5 and 0.7 m) for their effect on plant growth, dry mass production, sorghum yield and soybean grain yield. The experiment was a randomized block design: a 3 x 2 factorial scheme, with three levels of intercropping (palisade grass, Congo grass or sole cropping) and two levels of row spacing (0.5 or 0.7 m) with four replicates. Several physiological growth indexes were estimated from 10 to 60 days after emergence (DAE), including dry matter production and sorghum agronomic performance. Sorghum accumulated 0.22 g of dry matter d(-1) at 10 to 60 DAE, and was not affected by intercropping. The dry mass gain of forages (0.04 g d(-1) on average) was not affected by sorghum either. Higher sorghum grain yield (2,922 kg ha(-1)) was observed under the 0.5-m row spacing when compared to the 0.7-m spacing. The results indicate that palisade or Congo grass may be used as companion crops for sorghum with no grain yield loss, be it to improve soybean grain yield, soil cover or integrated crop systems, aiming at sustainable intensification.

The percentage of forage turnip and cereals in mixtures was 100+0%, 75+25%, 50+50%, 25+75%, and 0+100%, respectively. Experiments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The hay yield, crude protein yield, relative feed value (RFV), condensed tannin, total phenolic, total flavonoid, and mineral contents (K, P, Ca, and Mg) were determined. The hay yield of treatments was ranged between 5.45-10.27 t ha(-1). The highest crude protein yield was obtained mixture of 50FT+50O% (1.80 t ha(-1)). The pure forage turnip, 75FT+25B%, 75FT+25O%, and 50FT+50B% mixtures were statistically in the same group as 50FT+50O%. The condensed tannin was ranged between 2.00-2.84%. The highest RFV was calculated for 75FT+25O% (136.29), and the 50FT+50O% mixture (125.42) was statistically in the same group as mixture of 75FT+25O%. The present study showed that intercropping of forage turnip with barley and oat improved the hay yield and quality. The best results regarding for forage yield and quality were obtained from the FT+B and FT+O mixtures with seed rates of 75:25% and 50:50%.

Upland rice intercropped with green manures and its impact on the succession with common bean	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						"Autumn-winter beans; cover crops; Oryza sativa L; Phaseolus vulgaris L; polyculture"	"QUALITY; YIELD; PRODUCTIVITY; IMPROVE; CROP"	The aim of this work was to verify the possibility of intercropping rice with green manures, as well as the impact of the dry biomass yield of these intercropping systems on common bean in succession, evaluating the agronomic and qualitative performance of grains from both crops. The experiment was conducted in Southeastern Brazil in the years 2018 and 2019, with succession of rice (spring/summer) and common bean (autumn/winter). The treatments were composed of cropping systems with rice as a sole crop and intercropped with forage peanut, calopo, Crotalaria breviflora, Crotalaria spectabilis, stylo, jack bean and dwarf pigeon pea. No intercropping increased the system's yield compared to sole-crop rice, but intercropping of rice with forage peanut and stylo promoted grain yield and quality similar to those of sole-crop rice. Intercropping with C. breviflora affected the agronomic and qualitative performance of rice. Common bean yield after rice intercropped with dwarf pigeon pea, C. spectabilis and C. breviflora was similar in yield after sole-crop rice, while the other intercrops reduced common bean yield. Common bean grain quality was not affected by the cultivation of rice as sole crop and intercropped with green manures. Although none of the intercropping systems increased yield compared to sole-crop rice (control), it can be concluded that the intercropping of upland rice is viable depending on the green manure species, allowing greater biomass production per area that can help long-term soil conservation and increase the system's yield.

The current study investigates the comparative rhizobiome between sugarcane monoculture and sugarcane-soybean intercropping. A greenhouse experiment was performed with two treatments: (1) sugarcane monoculture and (2) sugarcane-soybean intercropped. We used a high-throughput sequencing (HTS) platform to analyze the microbial community. We used the 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer region primers to identify the microbial diversity. HTS results revealed that a total of 2,979 and 124 bacterial and fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were observed, respectively. Microbial diversity results concluded that the intercropping system has a beneficial impact on soil microbes. The highest numbers of bacterial and fungal OTUs were found in the intercropping system, and these results also collaborated with quantitative PCR results. Additionally, intercropped sugarcane plants showed a higher weight of above- and below-ground parts than the monoculture. Soil chemical analysis results also complemented that the intercropping system nourished organic carbon, total nitrogen, and soil enzyme activities. Correlation analysis of the diversity index and abundance concluded that soil nutrient content positively influenced the microbial abundance that improves plant growth. The present study frames out the profound insights of microbial community interaction under the sugarcane-soybean intercropping system. This information could help improve or increase the sugarcane crop production without causing any negative impact on sugarcane plant growth and development.

The aim of this study was to investigate the transfer of N from different legumes to cherry tomatoes in the intercropping system under residual straw of the previous green corn crop using the N-15 natural abundance method. We also investigated the temporal variation in nitrogen transfer to a cherry tomato, the biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) of legumes, and the N concentration of green corn cultivated in the intercrop succession. The experimental design was a complete randomized block with eight treatments and five replications, described as follows: two controls consisting of a monocrop of cherry tomato with or without residual straw, cherry tomato and jack bean, sun hemp, dwarf velvet bean, mung bean, and white lupine or cowpea bean in intercropping system. The BNF was responsible for more than half of the N accumulated in the legumes. The N of legumes was transferred to cherry tomato in similar quantities, and the leaves and fruits of cherry tomato received more N transfer than shoots. It was shown that N transfer increases with the growth/development of cherry tomatoes.

Sesbania brown manuring improves soil health, productivity, and profitability of post-rice bread wheat and chickpea	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article						"Brown manuring; Weed management; Soil properties; Legume incorporation; Conservation agriculture; Sustainability"	"CROPPING SYSTEMS; TILLAGE; CONSERVATION; CARBON; MANAGEMENT; NITROGEN; RESIDUE; PUNJAB"	Continuous rotation of rice with wheat in rice-wheat system has resulted in stagnant yields and reduced profit margins while deteriorating the soil health. Legume incorporation in existing rice wheat rotations might be a viable option to improve soil health and productivity. We investigated the influence of puddled transplanted flooded rice and direct-seeded rice on weed dynamics, soil health, productivity, and profitability of post-rice wheat and chickpea grown under zero tillage and conventional tillage. The previous direct-seeded rice crop was either sown alone or intercropped with sesbania as brown manure. The experiment comprised different rice-wheat and rice-chickpea systems which had been in place for two years: with and without rice residue retention. The initial soil analysis indicated that the plots with sesbania brown manuring in direct-seeded rice had the lowest soil bulk density (17.2%) and highest soil porosity (19.3%). Zero tillage in wheat or chickpea in the plots previously cultivated with co-culture of sesbania and direct-seeded rice increased total soil organic carbon by 13-22% in both years. The plots with sesbania brown manuring in direct-seeded rice followed by zero till or conventional till wheat and the plots with direct-seeded rice followed by zero till wheat with rice residue retention recorded the greater concentrations of total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and exchangeable potassium. Zero tillage in wheat and chickpea in post-rice sesbania brown manuring plots produced 41% and 43% more grain yield than those in the puddled transplanted flooded rice with conventional tillage and had the highest profitability. Overall, the rice chickpea systems had better soil health and profitability than rice wheat cropping systems. In conclusion, direct-seeded rice intercropped with s es bania followed by wheat and chickpea under zero tillage suppressed weed flora and improved soil physical properties, nutrient availability, productivity, and profitability.

The impacts on soil organic carbon (SOC) of these operations as well as the effects of more sustainable alternatives are still highly unknown. We hypothesized that the use of plants with deep root systems in the crop rotation could be a suitable alternative to mechanical chiseling for no-till fields. Thus, our objective in this study was to evaluate changes in SOC stocks, root development, and crop yield over time caused by mechanical and biological chiseling in a long-term no-till system (i.e., 18 years). The experiment was laid out as randomized blocks with four replicates and the treatments were as follows: 1) No-till system without any mechanical disturbance, cultivated with black oats + vetch in winter, here called No-till cover crop (NT-CC). 2) No-till system with one mechanical disturbance through chiseling, also cultivated with black oats + vetch in winter, here called No-till Mechanical Chiseling (NT-MC). 3) No-till without any mechanical disturbance cultivated with black oats + forage radish (Raphanus Sativus L.) instead of vetch, here called No-till Biological Chiseling. Compared to NT-CC, the use of NT-MC depleted the SOC stocks by -0.41 Mg ha- 1 year- 1. NT-MC also highly depleted proxies for microbialrelated C pools such as hot-water and permanganate extractable C. It demonstrates the deleterious effects of the mechanical chiseling operations on the surface depths (0-30 cm depth) of our long-term no-till system and raises concerns about the use of these operations in highly weathered areas. On the other hand, the NT-BC promoted significantly higher sequestration rates of 1.29 Mg ha- 1 year- 1 (LSD test, p < 0.05). The NT-BC has also promoted significantly higher sequestration rates of proxies of microbial-related organic matter, and soybean and wheat root development (length and mass) than the other managements. For cumulative crop yield and biomass input, both NT-BC and NT-CC promoted significantly higher values than NT-MC during the four years of assessment. The root development of wheat and soybean significantly contributed to the increase of SOC stocks, observed by positive correlations (p < 0.01). The results demonstrated that the use of radish as an intercrop for alleviating soil compaction was a good alternative to replace mechanical chiseling in compacted NT fields due to its superior performance in increasing SOC stocks, promoting higher root development, and crop yield.

Effect of mono-, relay-, and double-crop systems on yield and profitability	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article								Diversification and intensification of cropping systems are of interest due to the potential for increased farm income. However, yield and profitability of multi-crop systems need to be understood, especially in northern environments where the growing season is short. The objective of this study was to evaluate yield and profitability of monocrop (MC), relay-intercrop (RI), and double-crop (DC) systems. A 3-yr field study was conducted in northwest Ohio with nine cropping systems, including winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), red clover (Trifolium pretense L.), soybean (Glycine max L.), and oat (Avena sativa L.) grown in MC, RI, and DC systems. System yield was calculated by summing crop yield within a cropping year. Cropping system profitability was estimated by subtracting costs that varied across treatments from gross revenue. Winter wheat + RI red clover had the highest system yield (11.1-11.4 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)). However, profit was the greatest with wheat planted in wide row (38 cm row width) + RI red clover cropping system ($1,252 ha(-1) yr(-1)) followed by wheat planted in narrow row (19 cm row width) + RI red clover ($1,140 ha(-1) yr(-1)) and MC soybean ($919 ha(-1) yr(-1)). This suggests that producers interested in diversifying their cropping systems may increase profitability with a winter wheat + RI red clover system, provided there is a market for red clover forage. However, if producers do not have a market for red clover, the MC soybean system would offer greatest profitability and reduce workload compared with a multi-crop system.

Delaying sowing of field pea significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the severity of Ascochyta blight (all five locations) and Septoria blight (one location), increased the severity of downy mildew (four locations), but had no effect on seed yield. In relation to Ascochyta blight severity at 80 days after sowing, at all locations the early time of sowing had significantly (P < 0.05) more severe Ascochyta blight than the mid and late times of sowing. Increasing actual plant density from 20 to 25 plants m(-2) to 58 to 78 plants m(-2) significantly (P < 0.05) increased the severity of the Ascochyta blight (four locations) and downy mildew (one location), and it increased seed yield at four locations irrespective of sowing date and three locations irrespective of variety. Compared with varieties Dundale, Wirrega, and Pennant, variety Alma showed significantly (P < 0.05) less severe Ascochyta blight, downy mildew, and Septoria blight (one location each). Grain yield was highest for the early time of sowing at three locations. Varieties Alma, Dundale, and Wirrega significantly (P < 0.05) outyielded Pennant at four locations. The percentage of isolations of individual Ascochyta blight pathogens at 80 days after the first time of sowing varied greatly, with genus Didymella ranging from 25 to 93% and genus Phoma ranging from 6 to 23% across the five field locations. This fluctuating nature of individual pathogen types and proportions within the Ascochyta blight complex, along with variation in the occurrence of pathogens Peronospora and Septoria, highlights the challenges to understand and manage the complexities of cooccurring different foliar pathogens of field pea. While the search for more effective host resistance continues, there is a need for and opportunities from further exploring and exploiting cultural management approaches focusing on crop sequence diversification, intercropping, manipulating time of sowing and stand density, and application of improved seed sanitation and residue/inoculum management practices. We discuss the constraints and opportunities toward overcoming the challenges associated with managing foliar disease complexes in field pea.

Current studies mainly focus on the impact of small-scale crop diversity (such as intercropping) on ecological service but lack research on the effects of crop diversity at the landscape scale. In this study, vegetation-dwelling arthropods in naked oat (Avena chinensis) fields under different planting patterns were collected at different growth stages by standardized sweep netting sampling, and the differences in arthropod communities and temporal dynamics were analyzed. Taking this information as an example, the effects of crop diversity at the landscape scale caused by different planting patterns on arthropod communities were studied. It was found that herbivores were the most abundant functional group in the arthropod community in naked oat fields, accounting for 70.13% of the total abundance, followed by natural enemies, accounting for 23.45%, and, finally, other insects. The abundance and species richness of natural enemies in naked oat fields under diversified planting pattern were significantly higher than those under intensive planting pattern, while the abundance and species richness of herbivorous pests showed no significant difference between the two planting patterns. Planting patterns significantly affected the composition and structure of arthropod communities in naked oat fields. Significantly higher ratio of natural enemy to pest and more diverse natural enemies under the diversified planting pattern have shown better biological control potential and the significance of biodiversity protection.

Surface runoff and nutrient dynamics in cover crop-soybean systems in the Upper Midwest	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							"SNOWMELT RUNOFF; SOIL-EROSION; CORN-BELT; PHOSPHORUS RELEASE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; WINTER CAMELINA; OILSEED CROPS; UNITED-STATES; TILE DRAINAGE; WATER-QUALITY"	"Relay-cropping of the novel oilseeds winter camelina (Camelina sativa L.) and pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) with short-season crops such as soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] can provide economic and environmental incentives for adopting winter cover crop practices in the U.S. Upper Midwest. However, their ability to reduce nutrient loss in surface runoff is unknown. Accordingly, surface runoff and quality were evaluated during three seasonal phases (cover, intercrop, and soybean) over 2 yr in four cover crop-soybean treatments (pennycress, winter camelina, forage radish [Raphanus sativus L.], and winter rye [Secale cereale L.]) compared with no-till and chisel-till fallow treatments. Runoff was collected with Gerlach troughs and assessed for concentrations and loads of NO3--N, total mineral N, soluble reactive P (SRP), and total suspended solids (TSS). Cumulative runoff and nutrient loads were greater during the winter cover phase because of increased snow melt and freeze-thaw released nutrients from living vegetation. In contrast, cumulative TSS was greater during intercrop and soybean phases due to high-intensity rainfall events with an open soybean canopy. Average TSS loads during the intercrop phase were reduced by 75% in pennycress compared with fallow and radish treatments. During the soybean phase, average TSS, total mineral N, and SRP loads were generally elevated in cover crop treatments compared with no-till. Overwintering cover crops may contribute to mobility of nutrients solubilized from living or decomposing vegetation; however, this was balanced by their potential to reduce runoff and TSS during high-intensity spring rains."

These two principles can favor the soil quality and promote sustainable agricultural systems. The study was developed with the objective of measure soil microbial biomass, soil basal respiration, enzymatic activity and soybean yield in conservation systems cultivated with cover crops species in the Northeastern Cerrado.The experiment was carried out in 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 cropping seasons, performed in a randomized blocks design. The treatments were soil tillage systems allocated in the main plots: no-tillage (NT) and minimum tillage (MT) and the cover crops were allocated in the subplots: Pennisetum glaucum (millet), Urochloa ruziziensis (brachiaria), Crotalariaspectabilis (C. spectabilis), Crotalaria ochroleuca (C. ochroleuca), Pennisetum glaucum +Crotalaria spectabilis (millet + C. spectabilis) and spontaneous plants with three replicates.The evaluated variables were dry mass (DM) production and nutrient accumulation in covercrops; soil biological properties, namely microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen (MBC and MBN, respectively), respiration, metabolic quotient (qCO(2)), dehydrogenase enzymaticactivity (DH), fluorescein diacetate (FDA); and soybean yield. The higher production of dry mass and nutrient cycling occurs with the intercropping millet + C. spectabilis and single millet. The highest soybean yield occurs in succession to C. ochroleuca and intercropping of the millet + C. spectabilis.

J	"Verma, AK; Pandey, MK"				"Verma, Ajay Kumar; Pandey, Mukesh Kumar"			Automatic Seed Cum Fertilizer Drill: Modification and Performance Evaluation for Intercropping	AMA-AGRICULTURAL MECHANIZATION IN ASIA AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA			English	Article								A plastic roller type cup feed metering mechanism of automatic seed cum fertilizer drill was modified for sowing of intercrop of wheat-chickpea (2:1) and wheat-mustard (3:1). The metering roller was selected on the basis of shape and size of seeds and number of cells on the periphery. Different type of seed flow from each cup feed roller was achieved by dividing the seed hopper in separate compartments. For the selection of the metering mechanism, calibration was done among available 7 types of cup feed metering rollers with different combination of seed box exposure length. The modified intercrop seed drill was calibrated in the laboratory for required seed rate. The required seed rate for wheat-chickpea intercropping was found 75 kg/ha for wheat with roller number 4 and 25 kg/ha for chickpea with roller number 5 at seed box exposure scale number 7. The required seed rate for wheat-mustard intercrop was found 75 kg/ha for wheat with roller number 4 and 6 kg/ha for mustard with roller number 7 at seed box exposure scale number 7. The effective field capacity of seed cum fertilizer drill for wheat- chickpea was 0.42 ha/h and 0.47 ha/h for wheat- mustard inter cropping. As per the agronomical studies the intercropping of wheat-chickpea (2:1) was performed better as compare to wheat-mustard (3:1) as well as sole crops.

PLANTS-BASEL			English	Article						"Intercropping; winter barley; Cynodon dactylon; Eragrostis curvula; no-tillage; weeds"	"BARLEY HORDEUM-VULGARE; PERENNIAL GRASSES; WINTER-WHEAT; COVER CROP; TILLAGE; SOIL; ROTATION; GROWTH; POPULATIONS; INTENSITY"	The aim of the present work was to study the feasibility of pasture cropping under the Mediterranean conditions prevailing in central Spain and its potential as a weed management tool. Three cropping systems were assessed: conventionally grown winter barley and winter barley in pasture cropping with two perennial summer species, Cynodon dactylon and Eragrostis curvula. The results showed that the growth of these two species in a pasture cropping system was limited by the severe drought conditions and high temperatures present during the summer in some of the study years. Although there were no differences in the establishment of winter barley in any of the treatments assessed, pasture cropping reduced winter barley yields up to 50%-60% in years with low rainfall in spring. Regarding weed control, pasture cropping showed a significant suppression of the total weed density and number of weed species. As a conclusion, pasture cropping can be considered as a valid weed management tool. However, the economic feasibility of this system under the climatic conditions of central Spain (characterized by a high risk of severe summer droughts) is still not clear. The availability of supplemental irrigation may reduce competition between pastures and winter crops and ensure a profitable production of summer pastures.

An experiment was conducted to study the performance of pearl millet under different technologies in 2013 and 2014 main cropping seasons at the main site of the research center, Aybra, with the objective of evaluating and identifying appropriate combinations of technologies that enhance the production of pearl millet in the study area. About fourteen integrated technologies were applied in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The analysis was done by using SAS software version 9.1, and means were separated through the Duncan multiple range test. Results of analysis of variance showed that yield-related traits of pearl millet were significantly influenced by the integration of technologies in the 2013 cropping season. According to the results, the maximum yield (3084 kg ha(-1)) was recorded with the application of the treatment combination of recommended fertilizer application + seed primming + tie ridging, while the minimum was recorded (919 kg ha(-1)) in the treatment combination of microdose application of fertilizer + primed seed + intercropping of pearl millet with mung bean. In the case of the 2014 cropping season, the highest grain yield (3687 kg ha(-1)) was recorded with the treatment combination of microdose fertilizer application + primed seed + tie ridging + intercropping of pearl millet with mung bean, whereas the lowest grain yield (2115 kg ha(-1)) was recorded in the treatment combination of no fertilizer application + primed seed + flat bed. Based on the results of the current investigation, it could be recommended that using technology integration of microdose, tied ridge, primed seed, and intercropping of pearl millet with mung bean is better to attain maximum yield in the study area and similar agroecologies.

It is primarily cultivated in a crop succession system, in with soybean is grown in spring/summer. followed by corn or graminaceous pastures in autumn/winter as a second crop. Due to the intensive cultivation. new phytosanitary problems have arisen. among them the root-lesion nematode, Pratylenchus brachyunts, which besides causing damage to plant roots, can be important gateway for other soil pathogens. The recent occurrence of high nematode population densities has brought great concern due to the limited resistant soybean genotypes available. Besides, the use of nematicides only reduces nematodes populations temporarily. A viable alternative for the control of soil nematodes could be the use of Crotalaria spp. in succession or rotation with soybean. Crotalaria is immune or a bad host to the nematode. besides having high capacity of biological nitrogen fixation. Thus, the objective of the present research was to define the best way of insertion of this legume as a second crop in soybean production systems to reduce the population density of the rootlesion nematode. Two experiments were carried out: one in the field. in an infested area, and other in a greenhouse. In both experiments, the treatments were: 1) Zea mays. 2) Brachiaria brizantha cv. Xaraes,, 3) Z. mays +/- Crotalaria spectabilis. 4) Z. mays + C. ochmleuca. 5) B. brizantha cv. Xaraes + C. spectabilis, 6) B. brizantha cvz Xaraes + C. ochroleuca, 7) C. spectabilis, and 8) C. ochroleuca. The effect of the treatments was evaluated by estimating the number of nematodes in the roots of autumn/winter crops, as well as in the roots of the soybean cultivated in the sequence. The cultivation of both Crotalaria species provided suppression of the nematode population.

The experiment was carried out in a randomized complete block design, with four replicates. The treatments comprised six cropping systems before soybean: sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), palisade grass (Urochloa brizantha), and Congo grass (Urochloa ruziziensis) as cover plants, alone or intercropped, in addition to fallowing. Weeds were evaluated as to: density, dry matter mass, diversity, importance value, and similarity. The greatest similarity of weeds ocurred in single crops of sorghum, palisade grass, and Congo grass, in comparison with their intercroppings. Congo grass before soybean promoted a greater reduction in weed diversity overtime, when compared with palisade grass. The absence of cover crops before soybean cultivation increased weed infestation during the soybean cycle. The cropping systems with sorghum intercropped with cover crops before the soybean cultivation affect the diversity and the importance value of weed species.

We evaluated the effect of monoculture and intercropped winter cover crops on soil chemical attributes, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), basal respiration (BR), metabolic quotient (qCO(2)), urease, beta-glucosidase, and fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis activity, as well as onion yield in a no-tillage system. Soil is a Typic Humudept, and treatments were control with spontaneous vegetation, barley, rye, oilseed radish (OR), OR + rye, and OR + barley. The soil was sampled (0-10 cm) five times between June and Deceinber. There were no differences among treatments for MBC and BR, and the highest values for those attributes occurred in June, when cover plants were in their initial stage. Although, qCO(2) was not affected by any treatment, it varied among sampling periods, ranging from 0.62 to 10 mu g C-CO2 mg(-1) MBC h(-1), indicating a low- or no stress environment. Cover crops had little influence on enzyme activity, but FDA was lowered in areas with single crops of barley and rye. Average onion yield in cover crops treatments was 13.01 (Mg ha(-1)), 30-40% higher than in the control treatment.

Microbial biodiversity as related to crop succession and potato intercropping for management of brown rot disease	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL			English	Article						"Bacterial wilt; Ralstonia solanacearum; Bacteria community; Disease incidence; Antagonists"	"FLUORESCENT PSEUDOMONAS SPP.; RALSTONIA-SOLANACEARUM; BACTERIAL WILT; STENOTROPHOMONAS-MALTOPHILIA; BIOCONTROL AGENT; SOIL; ACID; SUPPRESSIVENESS; ENDOPHYTES; RESISTANT"	Potato brown rot, caused by Ralstonia solanacearum, ranked globally as the second most important bacterial plant pathogen. In the present study, the influence of different cropping programs in potato brown rot management was investigated in four infected fields in Egypt. Two districts were selected as sandy soils in Giza (Wardan) and Behera (Ganuob El-Tahrir) governorates. The other two were selected as silty clay in Minufyia (Talia) and Beni-Suef (Sids) governorates. The followed crop succession included corn, potato intercropped with cabbage, onion, cowpea, wheat, corn again, and ended by potato. The pathogen was undetectable after corn, onion, and wheat. It decreased in cowpea and cabbage rhizospheres in the clay soils. The pathogen was undetectable at all districts, except at Sids, where the pathogen was significantly decreased but was not eradicated. This was possibly attributed to the high ratio of NO3- and Na+ at this district. Decreased R. solanacearum density after corn coincided with the high ratio of fluorescent pseudomonads, endospores, and actinomycetes, being most clear in the poor soils (Wardan) and less clear under iron excess at Ganoub El-Tahrir as well as the clay soils. Corn rhizosphere supported an array of antagonistic actinomycetes such as strains similar to Streptomyces intermedius, Streptomyces albidoflavus group, Streptomyces argenteolus group, and Streptomyces erythrogriseus. Intercropping potato with cabbage decreased the density of the pathogen in rhizosphere, which is associated with greater antagonistic fluorescent pseudomonads, Bacillus spp. and Serratia spp. Onion soil and rhizosphere associated with abundance of antagonists and fluorescent pseudomonads, followed by S. maltophilia and Bacillus spp. Wheat soil and rhizosphere supported fluorescent pseudomonads and antagonistic Streptomyces spp., especially in sandy soils. The pathogen was undetectable after planting the ending potato in the three districts, Wardan, Ganoub El-Tahrir, and Talia. This was accompanied by a general oligotrophism and increased ratio of fluorescent pseudomonads, endospores bacteria, and actinomycetes along with a diversity of R. solanacearum antagonists such as S. maltophilia, Citrobacter freundii, Acinetobacter sp., Delftia sp., and Serratia marcescens.

Dewey). When managed for dual-use (grain and forage), Kernza intermediate wheatgrass can produce grain, crop residue (straw) in the summer, and green forage in the spring and fall. Mixtures of this grass with legumes could increase forage yield and nutritive value and provide other environmental and economic benefits. Despite the growing interest in these dual-use production systems, forage nutritive value of Kernza intermediate wheatgrass forage in a dual-use system in the Upper Midwest is unknown. A replicated field experiment was established in two locations in southern Wisconsin (Arlington and Lancaster) with two treatments: Kernza intermediate wheatgrass grown in monoculture and mixture with red clover (Trifolium pratense L.). Forage samples were collected at late vegetative stage in the spring, at grain harvest in the summer, and at the end of the regrowth period in the fall. Forage nutritive value of the monoculture was greatest in the spring with 456, 249 and 225 g kg(-1) for neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and crude protein (CP), respectively; lowest in the summer with 702, 427 and 51 g kg(-1) NDF, ADF and CP, respectively, and intermediate in the fall with 590, 337 and 119 g kg(-1) NDF, ADF and CP, respectively. Predicted total-tract neutral detergent fiber digestibility (ttNDFD) was 0.53 for the spring forage and averaged 0.37 for the summer and fall forage, with no differences between the mixture and monoculture. The relative forage quality (RFQ) for the monoculture was 175 for the spring forage, 65 for the summer residue, and 116 for the fall. Intercropping red clover with Kernza intermediate wheatgrass increased CP of the summer crop residue by 69%, and increased CP and RFQ of the fall forage by 49% and 11%, respectively, while reducing NDF and ADF of the fall forage by 25% and 18%, respectively. Therefore, Kernza intermediate wheatgrass forage is suitable for lactating beef cows, dairy cows, and growing heifers when harvested in the spring and fall, and it offers high potential for dual-use grain and forage systems."

The experiment in the field comprised four plots, two for each tropical forage, with and without overseeding. At the center of each plot, there was a weighing lysimeter with an automated system for data collection. ETc was measured daily over four seasons following the lysimetric method; ETo was calculated using the Penman-Monteith equation. ETc and ETo values were used to estimate Kc values. The single cropped Guinea grass showed the highest values for ETc, with mean ETc and Kc of 3.99 mm d(-1) and 1.07, respectively. The single cropped Bermuda grass showed ETc and Kc values of 3.57 mm and d(-1) 0.96, respectively. The results of paired t-testing for Kc showed no significant differences (p = 0.05) between single cropped and intercropped for both Guinea grass and Cynodon spp. During winter, intercropped Guinea grass did not show an ETc significantly higher than single cropped Guinea grass, with mean Kc values 0.98 for intercropped and 1.10 for single cropped. Similarly, Bermuda grass did not show significant differences between mean Kc values for intercropped (1.02) and single cropped (1.00)."

Sugarcane because of its initial slow growth can comfortably accommodate short-duration crops in between the rows. With the aim of assessing the profitability of sugarcane based-intercropping system, an experiment was taken up in randomized block design with five legume crops (green gram, black gram, cowpea, soybean and sunn hemp) as intercrops in sugarcane under wide row of planting (150 cm) along with sole sugarcane as control during 2016-2017 at ICAR-Sugarcane Breeding Institute, Coimbatore. Among the different intercropping systems followed, the yield attributes were nonsignificant except the number of millable cane (NMC/ha). The NMC recorded with sugarcane + soybean was significantly higher (116.5 thousands/ha) than control. Sugarcane intercropped with soybean has recorded significantly higher cane yield of 122.82 t/ha, followed by sugarcane intercropped with sunn hemp (117.31 t/ha) and black gram (116.38 t/ha), while sole crop of sugarcane has recorded the lowest cane yield of 74.30 t/ha. Among the five legume intercrops in sugarcane, sugarcane + soybean has recorded higher cane equivalent yield (CEY) of 132.0 t/ha, followed by sugarcane + green gram (119.4 t/ha). Sugarcane + sunn hemp has recorded higher LER of 1.39, followed by green gram (1.37) and soybean (1.21) when compared to sole crop of sugarcane. Weed smothering efficiency (WSE) was significantly higher in sugarcane + cowpea (36.3%) intercropping system followed by sunn hemp (32.3%) and soybean (32.0%) over the sole sugarcane (control). The highest gross return (Rs. 376,243/ha) was obtained from sugarcane + soybean followed by sugarcane + green gram (Rs. 340,242/ha), and it was lowest in sole sugarcane (Rs. 211,771/ha). Similarly, highest benefit-cost ratio (1.83) was observed in sugarcane + soybean, while lowest in sole sugarcane (1.06). On the basis of cane yield, cane equivalent yield and returns per rupee of investment, it is inferred that, among all the cropping systems, sugarcane + soybean found to be most profitable under wide row of planting than cultivation of sole sugarcane.

However, few studies have used the critical energy (CE) extracted from modeling to explain the effects of soil use and management on soil aggregation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of soil cover on the CE level required for dispersion of aggregates of a Typic Hapludalf. Soil samples collected from the 0.0-0.05 m depth were evaluated in five different managements with cover plants: perennial soybean (PS), peanuts (P), spontaneous vegetation (SV), black oat/forage turnip (BOFT), and black oat/hairy vetch (BOHV). Aggregates <= 2 mm of the treatments were exposed to ultrasonic irradiation during 0, 30, 60, 120 and 180 s. The specific applied energies were calculated based on sonification time and potency: 0, 745, 1490, 2980, and 4470 J.g(-1). After each sonification, sand (2000-53 mu m), silt (53-2 mu m) and clay (< 2 mu m) were quantified. The mass of aggregates of each size class was modeled as a function of the ultrasonic energy. The CE, the NDI and the b/a indexes were coefficients extracted from these models. Cover crops influenced the critical energy levels required for dispersion of aggregates of the Typic Hapludalf. However, our methodology did not prove management systems with intercrops of the cover crops, as black oats and vetch, contribute more effectively to the increase of soil aggregation.

Sesame Sole Crop and Intercrop Response to Fertilizer in Semi-Arid Niger	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							NUTRIENTS	Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) is a market crop of small-scale farmers, particularly women, in the Sahel. Guidelines for soil fertility management may help to boost the productivity and profitability of sesame production. Research was conducted in 2016 and 2017 at Maradi and Magaria in Niger to determine nutrient response functions for sesame as a sole crop and intercropped with pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.). Sesame yield was doubled with high consistency across site-years with 30 kg P ha(-1) applied and the P response function was determined. Sesame yield was not increased with N and K application. Manure application increased sesame grain yield by 25% when no fertilizer was applied and by 6% with 15 kg P ha(-1). The estimated fertilizer P equivalent value of manure P was 1.72 kg kg(-1) for no fertilizer P, indicating that manure application increased crop uptake capacity for indigenous soil P through, for example, increased root growth. Intercropped sesame and pearl millet yields decreased by about 41% of sole crop yields on average but the land equivalent ratio was about 1.2 with intercropping compared with sole crop production. The economically optimal P application rate ranged from 14 to 34 kg P ha(-1) for sesame sole crop and from 0 to 15 kg P ha(-1) for the intercrop with pearl millet, with the ranges resulting from varying fertilizer P use costs relative to crop value. Fertilizer P use has high profit potential for sesame sole crops in the Sahel but less potential for sesame-millet intercrops.

J	"Ali, E; Awade, NE"				"Ali, Essossinam; Awade, Nadege Essossolim"			Credit constraints and soybean farmers' welfare in subsistence agriculture in Togo	HELIYON			English	Article						"Agriculture; Economics"	"SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; GENDER; ACCESS; ADOPTION; IMPACTS; COUNTRY; MODELS"	This study assesses the impact of credit constraints on soybean farmers' welfare in subsistence agriculture in Togo. In order to control potential sample selection bias, the endogenous switching regression method was adopted and data collected from a random sample of 500 soybean farmers were used. The results showed that farmers' age, being a member of the soybean organization and selling the soybean to a recognized NGO or to a private organization and growing cotton or cashew are the main determinants of access to full amount of credit. The results show a discrimination against gender in accessing the full amount of credit. Formal education and participating in the extension programs would increase farmers' welfare. Increasing land cultivation would increase women's welfare compared to men. Adopting intercropping technique as conservation agriculture has positive and significant impact on women's welfare. Moreover, having access to the full amount of credit increases soybean production by 1.35% and farmers' revenue by 1.32%, compared to farmers without having access to the full amount of credit. These results suggest the rethinking of the role of agricultural credit in soybean farmers' welfare in the study areas with great attention to the gender dimension.

In this sense, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of different soil cover/mulching types on weed control and on the early development of pear trees Hosui cultvar. The experiment was conducted in two consecutive cycles: 2015/2016 and 2016/2017. Treatments consisted of the following soil covers in pear tree planting rows: natural cover, ryegrass straw intercropped with millet, pine sawdust, shading cover (70%), rice husk, Curaua fiber and weeding. Soil infestation by weeds was evaluated in the spring-summer period for two years, as well as the vegetative pear tree development (plant height and diameter and SPAD chlorophyll index). Managements using Curaua fiber and ryegrass straw + millet had the greatest suppression effects on weeds. The height and diameter of pear trees were smaller with natural cover and pine sawdust, while higher plant growth was observed with Curaua fiber and with weeding. Higher SPAD indexes was observed with Curaua fiber, weeding and ryegrass + millet. Curaua fiber also stood out for Fe and Mn leaf contents, while Zn contents were higher with ryegrass + millet and rice husk. Ryegrass straw + millet and rice husk can be highlighted for the chemical attributes of soil fertility and soil macrofauna indexes. It could be concluded that Curaua fiber and azevem + millet weed control weeds in the orchard, thus promoting better initial development of pear trees Hosui cultivar.
